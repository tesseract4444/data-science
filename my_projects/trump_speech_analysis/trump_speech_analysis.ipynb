      "thank you  everybody  great honor  great honor  thank you  this is a wonderful day  aww   chants of trump  trump  trump  wow Â  on a saturday morning yet  isn t that nice  thank you  all  and we re going to have an incredible convention  it s really going well  we re going to have an incredible convention  and we re going to get things solved  and we re going to do lots of wonderful things for our country  most importantly  so i m here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign  and the white house  to fix our rigged system    we are in a rigged  rigged system    and to make america safe again and to make america great again  i want to also address the islamic terror attack in france  we ve witnessed horror beyond belief  no matter where you look  and now it s happening more and more  and it s never going to stop  we need new leadership  we need new thinking  we need strength  we need in our country law and order  and if i m elected president  that will happen   applause  i want to express our unyielding support for the people of france  and we mourn their loss as a nation  and as far as turkey is concerned  so many friends in turkey  great people  amazing people  we wish them well  it looks like they re resolving the difficulty  but we wish them well  a lot of    a lot of anguish last night  but hopefully it ll all work out  now  as  hopefully  the next president of the united states  i want to refer back to what s happened over the years  the middle east today is more unstable than ever before  never been like this  out of control  after four years of clinton  who really led the way and led obama down a horrible path  because i don t even think he could have made these decisions so badly  she led him right down a horrible path  he didn t know what he was doing  iraq  syria  all into chaos  and iran is on a path to nuclear weapons  and on top of that  we gave them back  150 billion  and we didn t get our hostages until the end  now we re seeing unrest in turkey  a further demonstration of the failures of obama clinton  you just have to look  every single thing they touched has turned to horrible  horrible  death defying problems  we also need to bring back in this country    because we see what happened    our industry  our manufacturing  our jobs  they ve been taken away  like we re babies  taken away  and we re going to bring them back  i found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous    really prosperous society for all americans  indiana governor mike pence was my first choice  i ve admired the work he s done  especially in the state of indiana  and i m going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute  but i also admire the fact that he fights for the people  and he s going to fight for you  he is a solid  solid person   applause  governor pence served indiana with distinction in congress  he rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire house republican conference  number one  he s really got the skills of a highly talented executive  leading the state of indiana to jobs  growth  and opportunity  in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state s way by the obama administration  it s horrible out there  high taxes and regulations  and it s out of control  mike pence is a man of honor  character  and honesty  we know that  hillary clinton is the embodiment of corruption  she s a corrupt person  what she s done with her e mails  what she s done with so many things  and i see the ads up all the time  the ads  she s totally bought and paid for by wall street  the special interests  the lobbyists  100 percent  she s crooked hillary   applause  and i think that  while she got away with murder  in fact  i think it might be her greatest accomplishment  escaping the recent scandal  and her lies  and the loss of 33 000 e mails    but it wasn t a loss  she discarded    that in itself is a major crime  other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they ve done  which is peanuts compared to what happened with hillary clinton  thirty three thousand e mails are missing  and that s ok  didn t give them to the fbi  didn t give them to the attorney general  and that s ok  wipes her server clean  that s ok  these are crimes  these are crimes  and how she got away with it  i think i understand it  but i think a lot of people don t  but i do believe  while she didn t pay the price she should have paid  she s going to pay that price when november 8th rolls around  she s going to pay it at the polls  i believe that   applause  on top of everything else  hillary made  21 6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time  she s totally owned by wall street  we believe in americanism  she believes in globalism  and it s not that she believes in it  the people that give her all of this money believe in it  and she ll believe in whatever they want her to believe  believe me  that s it   applause  what a difference between crooked hillary clinton and mike pence   applause  mike pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy  radical islam  radical islamic terrorism  you saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window  you heard what he was screaming out the window  you saw it in san bernardino  you saw it at the world trade center  you saw it in orlando  how horrible was that  you saw it in paris  you see it all over  and hillary is a weak person  we are the law and order candidates  and we re the law and order party  we re going to change things around  there s going to be respect again for law and order   applause  hillary clinton s foreign policy helped launch isis  you know  she s talking    i see the ads she puts on  if i make one statement  which is fine  she ll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad  because she s got a lot of money because it s given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests  got a lot of money  but i see the ads on foreign policy  she s talking about donald trump doesn t have foreign policy experience  of course not  i ve been a very  very  very successful businessperson  i mean    but    but if you look at my calls  i said  don t go into iraq  nobody cared  because i was a businessperson  i was a civilian  take the oil  many  many calls i ve made  you take a look  i said that in scotland and in the u k   that was going to happen  i was the one that predicted it  and everybody said  he s wrong  he s wrong  president obama said  if it happens  they re going to get to the back of the line  which probably is one of the reasons they lost  because i consider it a win  i think it was a win for them  actually  because they don t want to be told what to do  and they don t want to be told that when people pour into the country  they have to take them even if they re not qualified  even if they don t have paperwork  even if they have no idea where they come from  and i said that brexit s going to happen  i said that they are going to break away  and everybody laughed at me  and the odds were 20 percent  and then when it happened  she took an ad saying  oh  donald trump said this or that  but i m the one that said it was going to happen  and some of the more fair reporters    about 30 percent of them    said he was right  i appreciate that  seventy percent didn t  so that s ok  so mike pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy  so important  now  i think if you look at one of the big reasons that i chose mike    and one of the reasons is party unity  i have to be honest  so many people have said party unity  because i m an outsider  i want to be an outsider  i think it s one of the reasons i won in landslides  i won in landslides  this wasn t close  this wasn t close   applause  no  this wasn t close  this was    in the history of the republican party  history  with 17 people running  you have to understand  other people ran against one  two  and three  there were 17  we got    i say we  because i m the messenger  i m a messenger    i m doing a good job  but i m a messenger    we got almost 14 million votes  that s more than any other person in the history of the republican party in the primary system running for president  think of it  that s more than ronald reagan  who we love  that s more than richard nixon  it s more than dwight d  eisenhower  you know  he won the second world war  in all fairness  pretty good  it s more than the bushes  but i mean by a lot  i don t mean by a little  but that s with 17 people  people don t over say that  that means our message is unbelievable  and i want to thank all of the loyal people    because i have such loyal  unbelievable people  and they displayed that just yesterday in cleveland  where it s going to be so amazing  but they displayed it  it was on display  where we had this group of people  who    many of whom i ve known  and i won t say  because for party unity  i ll say they re wonderful people  ok  never trump  they said  never trump  never trump  oh  we re going to win  they got crushed  and they got crushed immediately  because people want what we re saying to happen  they re tired of a country that has horrible trade deals  that has no borders  that has taxes that are through the roof  highest taxed nation just about in the world  that has regulations that don t allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start    and  by the way  speaking of destroying businesses  we re going to take care of the miners and we re going to take care of the steelworkers  we re going to put  em back to work   applause  so they re very tired of it  but i want to thank all of those people that   delegates   that were on the different committees  because  boy  was that something  did we show them something  and unfortunately  the vote was very late  but essentially  we had 112 12  this was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we re going to have a big fight  we re not going to have a fight  people agree with what we ve    they want the wall  they want the borders  they want these things to happen  and what we re doing     applause  and what we re doing that i m so proud of  so proud    and nobody else would even think about doing it    i fought very hard for it  we ll call it the johnson amendment  where he took away from the evangelicals    and i want to thank the evangelicals  because without the evangelicals  i could not have won this nomination  the evangelicals have been unbelievable  i dominated with the evangelicals  a lot of people were surprised  they say he s not perfect  but you know what  they know i m going to get the job done  and they re really smart   applause  and i said    and i said for the evangelicals  that we re going to do something that nobody s even tried to do  you have the johnson amendment passed by lyndon johnson and his group  and he was a powerful president  he knew how to get things done  he got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him  but he was a powerful president  and we call it the johnson amendment  where you are just absolutely shunned if you re evangelical  if you want to talk religion  you lose your tax exempt status  we put into the platform  we re going to get rid of that horrible johnson amendment  and we re going to let evangelicals  we re going to let christians and jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk  i saw this  i had so many great leaders so many times up to my office  the top    the absolute top evangelical leaders  christian leaders  jewish leaders  believe it or not  some muslim leaders    people are going to be surprised to hear that    i had the top leaders up to my office  and i said  why is it that you re so powerful as an individual  and yet when you get out there  you re sort of timid  and they didn t know how to answer the question  and it took two  three meetings before i figured it out  one great  great gentleman that everybody knows  but whose name i will not reveal  said  mr  trump  we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues  we live in fear that we re going to lose our tax exempt status if we say anything that s even slightly political  and i looked out the window  i was in trump tower  and i pointed to people walking down the street  i said  well  they have the right to speak  but you don t  that means they re more powerful than you are  we have to do something about it  how did it start  how did it start   applause  and they said  it started because of lyndon johnson  and he actually had a problem in texas with a certain religious leader  and he did this  and he got it done  and we re going to undo it  so that religious leaders in this country  and those unbelievable people  and not because they backed me in such large numbers   but so that religion can again have a voice  because religion s voice has been taken away  and we re going to change that  ok  all right   applause  back to mike pence  so one of the primary reasons i chose mike was i looked at indiana  and i won indiana big  remember  indiana was going to be the firewall  that s where trump was going down    they agreed i d win new york  i d win pennsylvania  i d win all these places  but indiana was going to be the firewall  so i got to study indiana  and i got to study new york and a lot of other places  and i saw how nafta  signed by bill clinton  has drained our manufacturing jobs  just drained us like we ve never been drained before  nafta  again  signed by bill clinton  nafta is the worst economic deal in the history of our country  manufacturing down in some states 55  60 percent  it s a horror show  moving to mexico  moving to other places  i have a friend who s a great builder  what he builds is plants  that s all he does  is build plants  he doesn t build buildings  he doesn t    he builds plants  it s the biggest in the world  from what i hear  i said  how s business  i was with him the other day  how s business  he goes unbelievable  i said  really  wow  i m surprised  why is it unbelievable  because i think of him as building in this country  he says  donald  what we re doing in mexico  you won t believe  i said  what do you mean  he said  we re building plants in mexico the likes of which we ve never seen  i said  what about this country  not much  not much  that s the expression  he said exactly that  not much  i said  but mexico  he said  you ve never seen anything like it  it s incredible  folks  that s going to stop  we re going to go reverse it  we re going to bring our jobs back to this country  we can t be the stupid people anymore  ok   applause  and he was better than a pollster  he s better than a consultant  i would say  how are we doing  and you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars  doesn t cost me millions  me  i give them  10 000  ok   laughter  it costs other people millions  it costs other campaigns millions to get a report  every time they get a report  it s millions  but i ll tell you what  a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report  and he said it  he didn t say it from the standpoint of he s upset about it  just fact  how are we doing  unbelievable in mexico  in fact  he actually said  i ve never  ever seen anything like it  and if you look  ford is building massive plants there instead of michigan  we want them to build them in michigan  they re going to build them in michigan  and you know that i know how to do that  so easy  so easy  but they re not going to do and they re not going to take advantage of us without retribution  there are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you re going to you re your product and sell it in here  there are consequences  and those consequences are going to keep companies in our country  it s very simple  and everybody here knows what the consequences are  but i won t say that because i m much more interested right now in mike   laughter  indiana s unemployment rate    and this is the primary reason i wanted mike  other than he looks very good  other than he s got an incredible family  incredible wife and family    karen is amazing   applause  incredible family  highly respected  expected to go for another four years  he would have won  i think  very easily in indiana  indiana  their unemployment rate has fallen  when he was there  when he started  8 4 percent when he was governor  when he took over  to less than 5 percent in may of 2016  since january 2013  indiana s labor force has increased by more than 186 000 jobs  you have to understand  i ve gone around to all these states  i ve gone to all of them  and every time  i have statisticians  i say give me the stats on a state  and it s always bad  down  down  down  down 40 percent  50 percent  60 percent in some cases  here s somebody where it s gone up  private sector job growth is up by more than 147 000 jobs since 2013  that s like very unusual  governor pence balanced the budget  can you imagine a balanced budget  our budget s so out of whack in this country  we don t know what we re doing  we re going to owe very soon  21 trillion  he balanced the budget  they don t know what that means  governor pence balanced the budget  produced a surplus  and maintains a  2 billion reserve fund in the state of indiana  it s also rated triple a  their bonds are rated triple a  very few states have that  triple a  the best  that s as good as you can get  whether you re a company  a state  triple a  indiana was recently recognized by chief executive magazine as the number one state in the midwest for business  number one  and it s not even close  there are approximately 34 000 fewer hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when mike pence took office  so you have fewer hoosiers  fewer people from indiana  and besides that  bobby knight  my friend  who really did help me  i mean  if you want a reference  bobby knight in indiana  we love bobby knight  but he agrees with everything i m saying  he loves the governor  indiana has the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation  for veterans  where nobody s fighting for the veterans like i m fighting for the veterans  the veterans have been left behind   applause  if you remember a few months ago  hillary clinton said the  really    they re doing much better  the v a  is much better  they re doing a much better job than people give it credit for  people are dying on line waiting for five  six days for doctors  people are dying on    they can t even see a doctor  it s a scandal  take a look at what s happening with the v a  in arizona  take a look at what s happening with    you know  just the veterans administration hospitals  it s a scandal  it s corrupt  it s incompetent  it s a scandal  and hillary clinton thought it was just fine  and  boy  am i going to win big with the veterans  i mean  we know that for a fact   applause  so it s now 2 4 percent for veterans  in 2013  when mike pence took office  the rate for veterans was 6 7 percent  it was 31st in the nation  one of the bad ones  and now it s almost the best  got  em jobs  got  em jobs  indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates  that s a great thing  they re going to stay there  that s a great thing  and mike worked hard on that  he was telling me  that was not easy  under governor pence s leadership  indiana enacted the largest k 12 education funding increase in the state s history  so you re balancing budgets  and yet you re giving more money to education  isn t that a great thing   applause  indiana has just about the largest school choice program in america  school choice is where it s at  folks  you want to get your schools better  you gotta get rid of common core fast  governor pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state s history  think of that  we re cutting taxes and balancing budgets  and along with corporate tax reform  just about number one in the country  cnbc ranked indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure  so with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets  we re spending more money on education  and the infrastructure is kept up  that had so much    look  as a builder  nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as donald trump  i build infrastructure  do i know how to build a wall  do i know how to build infrastructure  you know  it s very interesting  we re building    we re building    i won    the    which is pretty amazing with the obama administration  but i won the right to have the old post office building on pennsylvania avenue  right near the white house  and it s an amazing    probably the best location  one of the most sought after projects in the history of the gsa  general services  and i really like what s happened  we re going to have an opening very soon  ivanka and eric and don did a fantastic job on it  but i thought the other day  i was going over the numbers  we re under budget and about a year    actually more than a year   but we re a year ahead of schedule  and we re under budget substantially  and the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do   applause  and when i explained to a government representative that we re under budget and ahead of schedule  they almost fell off  because they ve never heard those words before  they ve never heard them  so when i see what happened to indiana  which was having tremendous problems  when i see what happened to indiana under mike s work    also his predecessor did a great job  by the way  great job  who s now at duke    who s now at purdue    when i see what happened with respect to the numbers  the state  and everything else  that  to me  was probably the single most important point  because it s something that hasn t happened    almost has not happened in this whole country  the turnaround and the strength of indiana has been incredible  and i learned that when i campaigned there  and i learned that when i won that state in a landslide  and i learned that when governor pence  under tremendous pressure from establishment people  endorsed somebody else  but it was more of an endorsement for me  if you remember  he talked about trump  then he talked about ted    who s a good guy  by the way  who s going to be speaking at the convention  ted cruz  good guy    but he talked about trump  ted  then he went back to trump  i said  who did he endorse  so even though he was under pressure  because i m so  you know  outside of the establishment  it was the single greatest non endorsement i ve ever had in my life  ok  i will tell you   applause  so with that  i would like to introduce a man who i truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the united states  governor mike pence  thank you  thank you  everybody  thank you   applause \n",

      "it s so great to be back in ohio come november  we are going to win this state  we are going to win the white house   and we are going to bring back your jobs we are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put american workers first we are going to stop the product dumping  the unfair foreign subsidies  and the currency manipulation  we are going to stop the foreign cheating the era of economic surrender is over a new era of american greatness is beginning no state has been hurt worse by the hillary clinton trade policies than ohio hillary clinton backed her husband s nafta  she backed china s entrance into the world trade organization  she backed the job killing trade deal with south korea  and backed the trans pacific partnership one bad deal after another hillary clinton s donors own her  and she will do whatever they tell her to do ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since nafta  and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since china entered the world trade organization our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly  800 billion dollars  this subtracts directly from our growth   our economy grew only 1 1 percent in the last quarter  a total disaster this is the legacy of hillary clinton i am promising a new legacy for america we are going to create a new american future but to do that  we have to stop the trans pacific partnership our trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost the state of ohio more than 100 000 manufacturing jobs last year  imagine how many more jobs would be lost if tpp was actually approved hillary clinton  who called the tpp the  gold standard   would 100  approve it if she ever got in we won t let that happen we will win this election  and we will keep america out of the tpp we will defend our freedom  our jobs  and our economic independence it s going to be america first my economic plan is going to grow this economy  raise your wages  and create millions of new jobs here are a few of the things we will do a massive tax cut for working americans we are going to eliminate regulations that kill american jobs  and that includes getting rid of the obama administration s new anti energy rules that will raise ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent hillary clinton says she wants to  put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business   just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business we are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work   and we are going to get your energy bills down we are going to repeal and replace obamacare  saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade we are going to create jobs for all of our people  and we are going to fight to ensure that every young african american and latino child is put on the ladder of american success  a good education  and a great job another major part of our agenda is immigration security  we need to protect american jobs  we need to protect american safety last night  i outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs  safety and security to the american people with bold new immigration reforms i had a great meeting yesterday with the president of mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border  put the cartels out of business  and to keep jobs in our hemisphere let s also talk about government corruption no issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay for play scandals as secretary of state here is one example of clinton corruption as secretary of state  hillary clinton signed off on a deal allowing russians to take an increased stake in a company called uranium one  giving up control of about 20 percent of america s uranium supply to the russians  clinton s approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars  in exchange for signing off on the deal  some of the former owners of uranium one gave the clinton foundation millions of dollars in donations  in addition  bill clinton received  500 000 for a speech to a kremlin backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal here is another example of pay for play in 2009  ericsson telecommunications came under u s  pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments   including sudan  syria  and iran  some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people in june 2011  hillary clinton s state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on iran and other state sponsors of terrorism during that time  ericsson sponsored a speech by bill clinton  paying him  750 000   his highest paying speech in april 2012  the obama administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to iran and syria  but those sanctions did not cover ericsson s work in iran a trump administration will end the government corruption no one will be above the law we will have one set of rules for everyone  in hillary clinton s world  we have one set of rules for her   and another set of rules for everyone else i am fighting for everyone who doesn t have a voice  the forgotten men and women of america i am your voice hillary clinton s campaign is funded by wall street and hedge fund managers my campaign is powered by my own money  but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5  10  or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters come november 8th  we are once again going to have a government that serves you  your family  and your country we are going to rebuild our depleted military  avoid needless foreign wars  build new friendships overseas  and remember those three famous words  peace through strength we are going to work with our allies to crush  defeat  and utterly destroy isis we are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don t support our tolerant values my tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses my energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill my trade reforms will raise wages  grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country my immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers my infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads  bridges and airports my regulatory reforms will make it easier for african americans small businesses to thrive  and for young children to live out their dreams my promise of school choice  charter schools and merit pay for teachers will help low income students in our inner cities  hillary clinton discriminates against poor african american children by opposing school choice my government reforms will make your voice heard   not the voice of the special interests every insider  getting rich off of our broken system  is throwing money at hillary clinton it s the powerful protecting the powerful insiders fighting for insiders i am fighting for you every day you turn on the nightly news  you hear about how some self interested banker or some washington insider says they oppose our campaign  or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign  or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign i wear their opposition as a badge of honor  because it means i am fighting for real change  not just partisan change  i am fighting   all of us across the country are fighting   for peaceful regime change in our own country  the media donor political complex that s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of  by and for the people i will fight to ensure that every american is treated equally  protected equally  and honored equally  we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms  and seek a new future of security  prosperity and opportunity   a future built on our common culture and values as one american people i am asking for your vote so i can be your champion in the white house to every parent who dreams for their children  and to every child who dreams for their future  i say these words to you tonight  i m with you  i will fight for you  and i will win for you together  we will make america strong again we will make american safe again and we will make america great again thank you  and god bless \n",

      "it s so great to be back in ohio come november  we are going to win this state  we are going to win the white house   and we are going to bring back your jobs we are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put american workers first we are going to stop the product dumping  the unfair foreign subsidies  and the currency manipulation  we are going to stop the foreign cheating the era of economic surrender is over a new era of american greatness is beginning no state has been hurt worse by the hillary clinton trade policies than ohio hillary clinton backed her husband s nafta  she backed china s entrance into the world trade organization  she backed the job killing trade deal with south korea  and backed the trans pacific partnership one bad deal after another hillary clinton s donors own her  and she will do whatever they tell her to do ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since nafta  and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since china entered the world trade organization our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly  800 billion dollars  this subtracts directly from our growth   our economy grew only 1 1 percent in the last quarter  a total disaster this is the legacy of hillary clinton i am promising a new legacy for america we are going to create a new american future but to do that  we have to stop the trans pacific partnership our trade deficit with the proposed tpp member countries cost the state of ohio more than 100 000 manufacturing jobs last year  imagine how many more jobs would be lost if tpp was actually approved hillary clinton  who called the tpp the  gold standard   would 100  approve it if she ever got in we won t let that happen we will win this election  and we will keep america out of the tpp we will defend our freedom  our jobs  and our economic independence it s going to be america first my economic plan is going to grow this economy  raise your wages  and create millions of new jobs here are a few of the things we will do a massive tax cut for working americans we are going to eliminate regulations that kill american jobs  and that includes getting rid of the obama administration s new anti energy rules that will raise ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent hillary clinton says she wants to  put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business   just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business we are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work   and we are going to get your energy bills down we are going to repeal and replace obamacare  saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade we are going to create jobs for all of our people  and we are going to fight to ensure that every young african american and latino child is put on the ladder of american success  a good education  and a great job another major part of our agenda is immigration security  we need to protect american jobs  we need to protect american safety last night  i outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs  safety and security to the american people with bold new immigration reforms i had a great meeting yesterday with the president of mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border  put the cartels out of business  and to keep jobs in our hemisphere let s also talk about government corruption no issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay for play scandals as secretary of state here is one example of clinton corruption as secretary of state  hillary clinton signed off on a deal allowing russians to take an increased stake in a company called uranium one  giving up control of about 20 percent of america s uranium supply to the russians  clinton s approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars  in exchange for signing off on the deal  some of the former owners of uranium one gave the clinton foundation millions of dollars in donations  in addition  bill clinton received  500 000 for a speech to a kremlin backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal here is another example of pay for play in 2009  ericsson telecommunications came under u s  pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments   including sudan  syria  and iran  some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people in june 2011  hillary clinton s state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on iran and other state sponsors of terrorism during that time  ericsson sponsored a speech by bill clinton  paying him  750 000   his highest paying speech in april 2012  the obama administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to iran and syria  but those sanctions did not cover ericsson s work in iran a trump administration will end the government corruption no one will be above the law we will have one set of rules for everyone  in hillary clinton s world  we have one set of rules for her   and another set of rules for everyone else i am fighting for everyone who doesn t have a voice  the forgotten men and women of america i am your voice hillary clinton s campaign is funded by wall street and hedge fund managers my campaign is powered by my own money  but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5  10  or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters come november 8th  we are once again going to have a government that serves you  your family  and your country we are going to rebuild our depleted military  avoid needless foreign wars  build new friendships overseas  and remember those three famous words  peace through strength we are going to work with our allies to crush  defeat  and utterly destroy isis we are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don t support our tolerant values my tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses my energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill my trade reforms will raise wages  grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country my immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers my infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads  bridges and airports my regulatory reforms will make it easier for african americans small businesses to thrive  and for young children to live out their dreams my promise of school choice  charter schools and merit pay for teachers will help low income students in our inner cities  hillary clinton discriminates against poor african american children by opposing school choice my government reforms will make your voice heard   not the voice of the special interests every insider  getting rich off of our broken system  is throwing money at hillary clinton it s the powerful protecting the powerful insiders fighting for insiders i am fighting for you every day you turn on the nightly news  you hear about how some self interested banker or some washington insider says they oppose our campaign  or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign  or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign i wear their opposition as a badge of honor  because it means i am fighting for real change  not just partisan change  i am fighting   all of us across the country are fighting   for peaceful regime change in our own country  the media donor political complex that s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of  by and for the people i will fight to ensure that every american is treated equally  protected equally  and honored equally  we will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms  and seek a new future of security  prosperity and opportunity   a future built on our common culture and values as one american people i am asking for your vote so i can be your champion in the white house to every parent who dreams for their children  and to every child who dreams for their future  i say these words to you tonight  i m with you  i will fight for you  and i will win for you together  we will make america strong again we will make american safe again and we will make america great again thank you  and god bless \n"

    "#### Explanation for the NaN and inf issue:\n",
    "The specific conditions within the data that can lead to undefined or infinite values in coherence scores depend on the measure being used. Here are some potential scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'c_v' (C_V coherence measure): This measure calculates the coherence based on a sliding window of top words in each topic. If a topic contains repetitive or highly similar words, it can result in a division by zero when calculating the coherence score, leading to an undefined value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'c_uci' (C_UCI coherence measure): This measure calculates the coherence based on normalized pointwise mutual information. If the distribution of words in the corpus is skewed or if certain words occur very infrequently, it can lead to zero probabilities, which cause logarithmic calculations in the measure to result in negative infinity (negative inf) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'c_npmi' (C_NPMI coherence measure): This measure also uses normalized pointwise mutual information, but it further normalizes the values to the range [-1, 1]. Similar to 'c_uci', if there are zero probabilities or extremely low probabilities for certain word pairs, it can lead to negative infinity (negative inf) values when calculating the coherence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues are typically related to the characteristics of the data, such as the distribution of words and their frequencies. It's important to preprocess the data properly, handle rare or out-of-vocabulary words, and ensure a diverse set of representative documents for meaningful coherence scores. Additionally, different measures may have varying sensitivities to these issues, which is why 'u_mass' often provides more reliable scores as it doesn't involve such calculations prone to undefined or infinite values."
