On November 9, 1923, in the fourth year of its existence, the National 
Socialist German Workers’ Party was dissolved and prohibited in the whole 
Reich territory. Today, in November, 1926, it stands again free before us, 
stronger and inwardly firmer than ever before. 


All the persecutions of the movement and its individual leaders, all 
vilifications and slanders, were powerless to harm it. The correctness of its 
ideas, the purity of its will, its supporters’ spirit of self-sacrifice, have caused 
it to issue from all repressions strong than ever. 


If, in the world of our present parliamentary corruption, it becomes more 
and more aware of the profoundest essence of its struggle, feels itself to be the 
purest embodiment of the value of race and personality and conducts itself 
accordingly, it will with almost mathematical certainty some day emerge 
victorious from its struggle. 


Just as Germany must inevitably win her rightful position on this earth if 
she is led and organized according to the same principles. 


A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to the care 
of its best racial elements must some day become lord of the earth. 


May the adherents of our movement never forget this if ever the 
magnitude of the sacrifices should beguile them to an anxious comparison with 
the possible results.
