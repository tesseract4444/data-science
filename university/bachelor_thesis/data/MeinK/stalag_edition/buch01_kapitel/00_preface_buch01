On April Ist, 1924, I began to serve my sentence of detention in the 
Fortress of Landsberg am Lech, following the verdict pronounced by the 
Munich Peopleâ€™s Court on that day. 


After years of uninterrupted labour it was now possible for the first time 
to begin a work for which many had asked and which I myself felt would be 
profitable for the Movement. I therefore decided to devote two volumes to a 
description not only of the aims of our Movement, but also of its development. 
There is more to be learned from this than from any purely doctrinaire treatise. 


This has also given me the opportunity of describing my own 
development in so far as such a description 1s necessary to the understanding 
of the first as well as of the second volume and to refute the unfounded tales 
which the Jewish press has circulated about me. 


In this work I turn not to strangers, but to those followers of the 
Movement whose hearts belong to it and who wish to study it more profoundly. 
I know that fewer people are won over by the written, than by the spoken, 
word and that every great movement on this earth owes its growth to great 
speakers and not to great writers. 


Nevertheless, in order to achieve more equality and uniformity in the 
defence of any doctrine, its fundamental principles must be committed to 
writing. May these two volumes therefore serve as building stones which I 
contribute to the common task.

The so-called national authorities refused to allow the dead heroes a 
common grave. I therefore dedicate to them the first volume of this work, as a

common memorial, in order that they, as martyrs to the cause, may be a 
permanent inspiration to the followers of our Movement.
