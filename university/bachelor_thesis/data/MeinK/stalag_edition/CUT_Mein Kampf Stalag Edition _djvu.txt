AUTHOR’S PREFACE 


On April Ist, 1924, I began to serve my sentence of detention in the 
Fortress of Landsberg am Lech, following the verdict pronounced by the 
Munich People’s Court on that day. 


After years of uninterrupted labour it was now possible for the first time 
to begin a work for which many had asked and which I myself felt would be 
profitable for the Movement. I therefore decided to devote two volumes to a 
description not only of the aims of our Movement, but also of its development. 
There is more to be learned from this than from any purely doctrinaire treatise. 


This has also given me the opportunity of describing my own 
development in so far as such a description 1s necessary to the understanding 
of the first as well as of the second volume and to refute the unfounded tales 
which the Jewish press has circulated about me. 


In this work I turn not to strangers, but to those followers of the 
Movement whose hearts belong to it and who wish to study it more profoundly. 
I know that fewer people are won over by the written, than by the spoken, 
word and that every great movement on this earth owes its growth to great 
speakers and not to great writers. 


Nevertheless, in order to achieve more equality and uniformity in the 
defence of any doctrine, its fundamental principles must be committed to 
writing. May these two volumes therefore serve as building stones which I 
contribute to the common task.

VOLUME ONE A RECKONING

CHAPTER 1: MY HOME 


To-day I consider it a good omen that Destiny appointed Braunau-on-the- 
Inn to be my birthplace, for that little town is situated just on the frontier 
between those two German States, the reunion of which seems, at least to us of 
the younger generation, a task to which we should devote our lives, and in the 
pursuit of which every possible means should be employed. 


German-Austria must be restored to the great German Fatherland, and 
not on economic grounds. Even if the union were a matter of economic 
indifference, and even if it were to be disadvantageous from the economic 
standpoint, it still ought to take place. People of the same blood should be in 
the same Reich. 


The German people will have no right to engage ina colonial policy 
until they have brought all their children together in one State. When the 
territory of the Reich embraces all Germans and proves incapable of assuring 
them a livelihood, only then can the moral right arise, from the need of the 
people, to acquire foreign territory. The plough is then the sword, and the tears 
of war will produce the daily bread for the generations to come. 


For this reason the little frontier town appeared to me as the symbol of a 
great task, but in another respect it teaches us a lesson that is applicable to our 
day. Over a hundred years ago this sequestered spot was the scene of a tragic 
calamity which affected the whole German nation and will he remembered for 
ever, at least in the annals of German history. 


At the time of our Fatherland’s deepest humiliation, a Nurnberg 
bookseller, Johannes Palm, an uncompromising nationalist and an enemy of the 
French, was put to death here because he had loved Germany even in her 
misfortune. He obstinately refused to disclose the names of his associates, or 
rather the principals who were chiefly responsible for the affair, just as Leo 
Schlageter did. 


The former, like the latter, was denounced to the French by a government 
official, a director of police from Augsburg who won ignoble renown on that 
occasion and set the example which was to be copied at a later date by the 
German officials of the Reich under Herr Severing’s regime. 


In this little town on the Inn, hallowed by the memory of a German 


16 


martyr a town that was Bavarian by blood but under the rule of the Austrian 
State, my parents were domiciled towards the end of the last century. My father 
was a civil servant who fulfilled his duties very conscientiously. 


My mother looked after the household and lovingly devoted herself to the 
care of her children of that period I have not retained many memories, because 
after a few years my father had to leave that frontier town which I had come to 
love so much and take up a new post farther down the Inn valley, at Passau, 
therefore, actually in Germany itself: 


In those days it was the usual lot of an Austrian civil servant to be 
transferred periodically from one post to another. Not long after coming to 
Passau my father was transferred to Linz, and while there he retired to live on 
his pension, but this did not mean that the old gentleman would now rest from 
his labours. 


He was the son of a poor cottager, and while still a boy he grew restless 
and left home. When he was barely thirteen years old he buckled on his satchel 
and set forth from his native country parish. Despite the dissuasion of villagers 
who could speak from ‘experience’, he went to Vienna to learn a trade there. 
This was in the fifties of last century. 


It was a sore trial, that of deciding to leave home and face the unknown, 
with three gulden in his pocket but when the boy of thirteen was a lad of 
seventeen and had passed his apprenticeship examination as a craftsman, he 
was not content. On the contrary, the persistent economic depression of that 
period and the constant want and misery strengthened his resolution to give up 
working at a trade and strive for ‘something higher.’ 


As a boy it had seemed to him that the position of the parish priest in his 
native village was the highest in the scale of human attainment, but now that the 
big city had enlarged his outlook the young man looked up to the dignity of a 
state official as the highest of all. With the tenacity of one whom misery and 
trouble had already made old when only half-way through his youth, the young 
man of seventeen obstinately set out on his new project and stuck to it until he 
won through. 


He became a civil servant. He was about twenty-three years old, I think, 
when he succeeded in making himself what he had resolved to become. Thus 
he was able to keep, the vow he had made as a poor boy, not to return to his 
native village until he was ‘somebody.’ He had gained his end, but in the 


17 


village there was nobody who remembered him as a little boy, and the village 
itself had become strange to him. 


Now at last, when he was fifty-six years old, he gave up his active 
career, but he could not bear to be idle for a single day. On the outskirts of the 
small market-town of Lambach in Upper Austria he bought a farm and tilled it 
himself. Thus, at the end of a long and hard-working career, he returned to the 
life which his father had led. 


It was at this period that I first began to have ideals of my own. I spent a 
good deal of time scampering about in the open, on the long road from school, 
and mixing with some of the roughest of the boys, which caused my mother 
many anxious moments. All this tended to make me something quite the reverse 
of a stay-at-home. 


I gave scarcely any serious thought to the question of choosing a vocation 
in life, but I was certainly quite out of sympathy with the kind of career which 
my father had followed. I think that an inborn talent for speaking now began to 
develop and take shape during the more or less strenuous arguments which I 
used to have with my comrades. 


I had become a juvenile ringleader who learned well and easily at 
school, but was rather difficult to manage. In my free time I practised singing in 
the choir of the monastery church at Lambach, and thus it happened that I was 
placed ina very favourable position to be emotionally impressed again and 
again by the magnificent splendour of ecclesiastical ceremonial. 


What could be more natural for me than to look upon the abbot as 
representing the highest human ideal worth striving for, just as the position of 
the humble village priest had appeared so to my father in his own boyhood 
days? 


At least that was my idea for a while, but the childish disputes I had with 
my father did not lead him to appreciate his son’s oratorical gifts in such a way 
as to see in them a favourable promise for such a career, and so he naturally 
could not understand the boyish ideas I had in my head at that time. This 
contradiction in my character made him feel somewhat anxious. 


As a matter of fact, that transitory yearning after such a vocation soon 
gave way to hopes that were better suited to my temperament. Browsing among 
my father’s books, I chanced to come across some publications that dealt with 


18 


military subjects. One of these publications was a popular history of the 
Franco-German War of 1870-71. 


It consisted of two volumes of art illustrated periodical dating from 
those years. These became my favourite reading. In a little while that great and 
heroic conflict began to occupy my mind, and from that time onwards I became 
more and more enthusiastic about everything that was in any way connected 
with war or military affairs. 


The story of the Franco-German War had a special significance for me 
on other grounds also. For the first time, and as yet only in quite a vague way, 
the question began to present itself: Is there a difference—and if there be, what 
is it—between the Germans who fought that war, and the other Germans? 


Why did not Austria also take part in it? Why did not my father and all 
the others fight in that struggle? Are we not the same as the other Germans? Do 
we not all belong together? 


That was the fiat time that this problem began to agitate my small brain, 
and from the replies that were given to the questions which I asked very 
tentatively, I was forced to accept the fact, though with a secret envy, that not 
all Germans had the good luck to belong to Bismarck’s Reich. This was 
something that I could not understand. 


It was decided that I should study. Considering my character as a whole, 
and especially my temperament, my father decided that the classical subjects 
studied at the Gymnasium were not suited to my natural talents, lie thought that 
the Realschule would suit me better. 


My obvious talent for drawing confirmed him in that view, for in his 
opinion, drawing was a subject too much neglected in the Austrian 
Gymnasium. Probably also the memory of the hard road which he himself had 
travelled contributed to make him look upon classical studies as unpractical 
and accordingly to set little value on them. 


At the back of his mind he had the idea that his son should also become a 
government official. Indeed he had decided on that career for me. The 
difficulties with which he had had to contend in making his own career led him 
to overestimate what he had achieved, because this was exclusively the result 
of his own indefatigable industry and energy. 


The characteristic pride of the self-made man caused him to cherish the 


19 


idea that his son should follow the same calling and if possible rise to a higher 
position in it. Moreover, this idea was strengthened by the consideration that 
the results of his own life’s industry had placed him in a position to facilitate 
his son’s advancement in the same profession. 


He was simply incapable of imagining that I might reject what had meant 
everything in life to him. My father’s decision was simple, definite, clear and 
in his eyes, it was something to be taken for granted. 


A man of such a nature who had become an autocrat by reason of his 
own hard struggle for existence, could not think of allowing ‘inexperienced’ 
and irresponsible young people to choose their own careers. 


To act in such a way, where the future of his own son was concerned, 
would have been a grave and reprehensible weakness in the exercise ‘of 
parental authority and responsibility, something utterly incompatible with his 
characteristic sense of duty.’ Still, he did not have his way. 


For the first time in my life (I was then eleven years old) I felt myself 
forced into open opposition. No matter how hard and determined my father 
might be about putting his own plans and opinions into effect, his son was no 
less obstinate in refusing to accept ideas on which he set little or no value. I 
would not become a civil servant. 


No amount of persuasion and no amount of ‘grave’ warnings could break 
down that opposition. I would not become a government official, not on any 
account. 


All the attempts which my father made to arouse in me a love or liking 
for that profession, by picturing his own career for me, had only the opposite 
effect. It nauseated me to think that one day I might be fettered to an office 
stool, that I could not dispose of my own time, but would be forced to spend 
the whole of my life filling out forms. 


One can imagine what kind of thoughts such a prospect awakened in the 
mind of a boy who was by no means what is called a ‘good boy’ in the current 
sense of that term. The ease with which I learned my lessons made it possible 
for me to spend, far more time in the open air than at home. 


To-day, when my political opponents pry into my life, as far back as the 
days of my boyhood, with diligent scrutiny so as finally to be able to prove 
what disreputable tricks this Hitler was, accustomed to play in his young day, I 


20 


thank Heaven that I can look back on those happy days and find the memory of 
them helpful. 


The fields and the woods were then the terrain on which all disputes 
were fought out. Even attendance at the Realschule could not alter my way of 
spending my time. But I had now another battle to fight. 


So long as the paternal plan to make me a state functionary contradicted 
my own inclinations only in the abstract, the conflict was easy to bear. I could 
be discreet about expressing my person it views and thus avoid constantly 
recurrent disputes. 


My own resolution not to become a government official was sufficient 
for the time being to put my mind completely at rest. I held on to that resolution 
inexorably. 


But the situation became more difficult once I had a positive plan of my 
own which I could present to my father as a counter-suggestion. This happened 
when I was twelve years old. How it came about I cannot exactly say now, but 
one day it became clear to me that I wanted to be a painter—I mean an artist. 


That I had an aptitude for drawing was an admitted fact. It was even one 
of the reasons why my father had sent me to the Realschule; but he had never 
thought of having that talent developed so that I could take up painting as a 
professional career. Quite the contrary. 


When, as a result of my renewed refusal to comply with his favourite 
plan, my father asked me for the first time what I myself really wished to be, 
the resolution that I had already formed expressed itself almost automatically. 
For a while my father was speechless. 


“A painter? An artist?” he exclaimed. 


He wondered whether I was in a sound state of mind. He thought that he 
might not have caught my words rightly, or that he had misunderstood what I 
meant, but when I had explained my ideas to him and he saw how seriously I 
took them, he opposed them with his characteristic energy. His decision was 
exceedingly simple and could not be deflected from its course by any 
consideration of what my own natural qualifications really were. 


“Artist! Not as long as I live, never.” As the son had inherited some of 
the father’s obstinacy, along with other qualities, his reply was equally 


21 


energetic, but, of course, opposed to his, and so the matter stood. My father 
would not abandon his ‘Never,’ and I became all the more determined in my 
‘Nevertheless.’ 


Naturally the resulting situation was not pleasant. The old gentleman was 
embittered and indeed so was I, although I really loved him. My father forbade 
me to entertain any hopes of taking up painting as a profession. I went a step 
further and declared that I would not study anything else. With such 
declarations the situation became still more strained, so that the old gentleman 
decided to assert his parental authority at all costs. 


This led me to take refuge in silence, but I put my threat into execution. I 
thought that, once it became clear to my father that | was making no progress at 
the Realschule, he would be forced to allow me to follow the career I had 
dreamed of. 


I do not know whether I calculated rightly or not. Certainly my failure to 
make progress became apparent in the school. I studied just those subjects that 
appealed to me, especially those which I thought might be of advantage to me 
later on as a painter. What did not appear to have any importance from this 
point of view, or what did not otherwise appeal to me, I completely neglected. 


My school reports of that time were always in the extremes of good or 
bad, according to the subject and the interest it had for me. In one column the 
remark was ‘very good’ or ‘excellent, in another ‘average’ or even “below 
average.’ By far my best subjects were geography and general history. These 
were my two favourite subjects, and I was top of the class in them. 


When I look back over so many years and try to judge the results of that 
experience I find two very significant facts standing out clearly before my 
mind. Firstly, I became a nationalist. Secondly, I learned to understand and 
grasp the true meaning of history. 


The old Austria was a multi-national State. In those days at least, the 
citizens of the German Reich, taken all in all, could not understand what that 
fact meant in the everyday life of the individuals within such a State. 


After the magnificent triumphant march of the victorious armies in the 
Franco-German War the Germans in the Reich became steadily more and more 
estranged from the Germans beyond their frontiers, partly because they did not 
deign to appreciate those other Germans at their, true value or simply because 


OM) 


they were incapable of doing so. In thinking of Austria, they were prone to 
confuse the decadent dynasty and the people which was essentially very sound. 


The Germans in the Reich did not realise that if the Germans in Austria 
had not been of the best racial stock they could never have given the stamp of 
their own character to an Empire of fifty-two millions, so definitely that in 
Germany itself the idea arose—though quite erroneously—that Austria was a 
German State. 


That was an error which had dire consequences; but all the same it was a 
magnificent testimony to the character of the ten million Germans in the 
Ostmark. Only very few Germans in the Reich itself had an idea of the bitter 
struggle which those Eastern Germans had to carry on daily for the 
preservation of their German language, their German schools and their German 
character. 


Only to-day, when a tragic fate has wrested several millions of our 
kinsfolk from the Reich and has forced them to live under the rule of the 
stranger, dreaming of that common fatherland towards which all their yearnings 
are directed and struggling to uphold at least the sacred right of using their 
mother tongue—only now have the wider circles of the German population 
come to realise what it means to have to fight for the traditions of one’s race. 


So at last, perhaps there are people here and there who can assess the 
greatness of that German spirit which animated the old Ostmark and enabled 
those people, left entirely dependent on their own resources, to defend the 
Reich against the Orient for several centuries and subsequently to hold the 
frontiers of the German language by means of a guerilla warfare of attrition, at 
a time when the German Reich was sedulously cultivating an interest in 
colonies but not in its own flesh and blood at its very threshold. 


What has happened always and everywhere, in every kind of struggle, 
happened also in the language fight which was carried on in the old Austria. 
There were three groups the fighters, those who were luke-warm, and the 
traitors. 


This sifting process began even in the schools and it is worth noting that 
the struggle for the language was waged perhaps in its bitterest form around the 
school, because this was the nursery where the seeds had to be tended which 
were to spring up and form the future generation. 


23 


The tactical objective of the fight was the winning over of the child, and 
it was to the child that the first rallying cry was addressed, “German boy, do 
not forget that you are a German,” and “Remember, little girl, that one day you 
must be a German mother.” 


Those who know something of the juvenile spirit can understand how 
youth will always lend a ready ear to such a rallying cry. In many ways the 
young people led the struggle, fighting in their own manner and with their own 
weapons. They refused to sing non-German songs. 


The greater the efforts made to win them away from their German 
allegiance, the more they exalted the glory of their German heroes. They stinted 
themselves in buying sweetmeats, so that they might spare their pennies to help 
the war fund of their elders. 


They were incredibly alert to the significance of what the non-German 
teachers said and they contradicted in unison. They wore the forbidden 
emblems of their own nation and were happy when penalized, or even 
physically punished. In their own way, they faithfully mirrored their elders, and 
often their attitude was finer and more sincere. 


Thus it was that at a comparatively early age I took part in the struggle 
which the nationalities were waging against one another in the old Austria. 
When collections were made for the youth Mark German League and the 
School League we wore cornflowers and black-red-gold colours to express 
our loyalty. We greeted one another with Heil! and instead of the Austrian 
anthem we sang our own Deutschland uber Alles, despite warnings and 
penalties. 


Thus the youth was being educated politically, at a time when the citizens 
of a so-called national State for the most part knew little of their own 
nationality except the language. 


Of course, I did not belong to the luke-warm section. Within a little 
while I had become an ardent ‘German National,’ which had a different 
meaning from the party significance attached to that term to-day. 


I developed very rapidly in the nationalist direction, and by the time I 
was fifteen years old, I had come to understand the distinction between 
dynastic patriotism and volkisch nationalism, my sympathies being entirely in 
favour of the latter even in those days. 


24 


Such a preference may not perhaps be clearly intelligible to those who 
have never taken the trouble to study the internal conditions that prevailed in 
Austria under the Habsburg monarchy. 


In Austria it was world-history as taught in schools that served to sow 
the seeds of this development, for Austrian history, as such, is practically non- 
existent. 


The fate of this State was closely bound up with the existence and 
development of Germany as a whole, so that a division of history into German 
history and Austrian history 1s practically inconceivable. And indeed it was 
only when the German people came to be divided between two States that this 
division began to make German history. 


The insignia of a former imperial sovereignty which were still preserved 
in Vienna appeared to act as a magic guarantee of an everlasting bond of union. 


When the Habsburg State crumbled to pieces in 1918 the Austrian 
Germans instinctively raised an outcry for union with their German mother- 
country. That was the voice of unanimous yearning in the hearts of the whole 
people for a return to the unforgotten home of their fathers. 


But such a general yearning could not be explained except by the 
historical training through which the individual Austrian Germans had passed. 
It was a spring that never dried up. Especially in times of distraction and 
forgetfulness its quiet voice was a reminder of the past, bidding the people to 
look beyond the mere well-being of the moment to a new future. 


The teaching of universal history in what are called the higher grade 
schools is still very unsatisfactory. 


Few teachers realise that the purpose of teaching history is not the 
memorizing of some dates and facts, that it does not matter whether a boy 
knows the exact date of a battle or the birthday of some marshal or other, nor 
when the crown of his fathers was placed on the brow of some insignificant 
monarch. That is not what matters. 


To study history means to search for and discover the forces that are the 
causes of those results which appear before our eyes as historical events. The 
art of reading and studying consists in remembering the essentials and 
forgetting what is inessential. 


2D 


Probably my whole future life was determined by the fact that I had a 
teacher of history who understood, as few others understand, how to make this 
viewpoint prevail in teaching and in examining. This teacher was Dr. Leopold 
Poetsch, of the Realschule at Linz. He was the ideal personification of the 
qualities necessary to a teacher of history in the sense I have mentioned above. 


An elderly gentleman with a decisive manner but a kindly heart, he was a 
very attractive speaker and, was able to inspire us with his own enthusiasm. 
Even to-day I cannot recall without emotion that venerable personality whose 
enthusiastic exposition of history so often made us entirely forget the present 
and allow ourselves to be transported as if by magic into the past. 


He penetrated through the dim mist of thousands of years and 
transformed the historical memory of the dead, past into a living reality. When 
we listened to him we became afire with enthusiasm and we were sometimes 
moved even to tears. 


It was still more fortunate that this master was able not only to illustrate 
the past by examples from the present, but from the past, he was also able to 
draw a lesson for the present. 


He understood better than any other the everyday problems that were 
then agitating our minds. The national fervour which we fell in our own small 
way was utilised by him as an instrument of our education, inasmuch as he 
often appealed to our national sense of honour, for in that way he maintained 
order and held our attention much more easily than he could have done by any 
other means. It was because I had such a master that history became my 
favourite subject. As a natural consequence, but without the conscious 
connivance of my teacher, I then and there became a young rebel. 


But who could have studied German history under such a teacher and not 
become an enemy of that State whose rulers exercised such, a disastrous 
influence on the destinies of the German nation? 


Finally, how could one remain a faithful subject of the House of 
Habsburg, whose past history and present conduct proved it to be ready, ever 
and always, to betray the interests of the German people for the sake of paltry 
personal interests? Did not we, as youngsters, fully realise that the House of 
Habsburg did not, and could not, have any love for us Germans? 


What history taught us about the policy followed by the House of 


26 


Habsburg was corroborated by our own everyday experiences. In the north and 
in the south the poison of foreign races was eating into the body of our people, 
and even Vienna was steadily becoming more and more a non-German city. 
The ‘Imperial House’ favoured the Czechs on every possible occasion. 


Indeed, it was the hand of the goddess of eternal justice and inexorable 
retribution that caused the most deadly enemy of Germanism in Austria, the 
Archduke Franz Ferdinand, to fall by the very bullets which he himself had 
helped to cast. He was the prime mover in the work, begun by the ruling 
classes, of turning Austria into a Slav State. 


The burdens laid on the shoulders of the German people were enormous 
and the sacrifices of money and blood which they had to make were incredibly 
heavy. Yet anybody who was not quite blind must have seen that it was all in 
vain. 


What affected us most bitterly was the consciousness of the fact that this 
whole system was morally sanctioned by the alliance with Germany, whereby 
the slow extirpation of Germanism in the old Austrian Monarchy seemed in 
some way to be more or less countenanced by Germany herself. 


Habsburg hypocrisy, which endeavoured outwardly to make the people 
believe that Austria still remained a German State, increased the feeling of 
hatred against the Imperial House and at the same time aroused a spirit of 
rebellion and contempt. 


Only in the German Reich itself did those who were then its rulers fail to 
understand what all this meant. As if struck blind, they stood beside a corpse 
and in the very symptoms of decomposition they believed that they recognised 
the signs of renewed vitality. In that unhappy alliance between the young 
German Empire and the illusory Austrian State lay the germ of the World War 
and also of the final collapse. 


In subsequent passages of this book I shall go to the root of this problem. 
Suffice it here to say that in the very early years of my youth I came to certain 
conclusions which I have never abandoned, Indeed I became more profoundly 
convinced of them as the years passed. 


They were, firstly, that the dissolution of the Austrian Empire was a 
preliminary condition for the safeguarding of German nationality and culture; 
further, that national feeling is by no means identical with dynastic patriotism; 


2} 


and, above all, that the House of Habsburg was destined to bring misfortune on 
the German nation. As a logical consequence of these convictions, there arose 
in me a feeling of intense love for my German-Austrian home and a profound 
hatred for the Austrian State. 


The way of looking at history which was developed in me through my 
study of history at school never left me afterwards. World-history became 
more and more an inexhaustible source for the understanding of contemporary 
historical events, which means politics. Therefore, I would not ‘learn’ history, 
but let history teach me. 


A precocious revolutionary in politics, I was no less a precocious 
revolutionary in art. At that time, the provincial capital of Upper Austria had a 
theatre which, relatively speaking, was not bad. Almost everything was 
produced there. 


When I was twelve years old I saw a performance of Wilhelm Tell there. 
That was my first experience of the theatre. Some months later I attended a 
performance of Lohengrin, the first opera I had ever heard. I was fascinated at 
once. 


My youthful enthusiasm for the Bayreuth Master knew no bounds. Again 
and again I was drawn to hear his operas; and to-day I consider it a great piece 
of luck that these modest productions in the little provincial city prepared the 
way and made it possible for me to appreciate better productions later on. 


All this helped to intensify my profound aversion for the career that my 
father had chosen for me, and this dislike became especially strong as the 
rough corners of youthful boorishness were worn down, a process which, in 
my case, was fraught with a good deal of pain. 


I became more and more convinced that I should never be happy as a 
government official, and now that the Realschule had recognised and 
acknowledged my aptitude for drawing, my own resolution became all the 
stronger. 


Imprecations and threats had no longer any power to change it. I wanted 
to become a painter and no power on earth could force me to become a civil 
servant. The only peculiar feature of, the situation now was that as I grew 
bigger I became more and more interested in architecture. 


I considered this fact as a natural complement of my talent for painting 


28 


and I rejoiced inwardly that the sphere of my artistic interests was thus 
enlarged. I had no notion that one day it would have to be otherwise. 


The question of my career was decided much sooner than I could have 
foreseen. When I was in my thirteenth year my father was suddenly taken from 
us. He was still in robust health when a stroke of apoplexy painlessly ended 
his earthly sojourn and left us all deeply bereaved. 


His most ardent longing was to be able to help his son to advance ina 
career and thus save him from the harsh ordeal that he himself had had to 
undergo, but it appeared then as if that longing were in vain. And yet, though he 
himself was not conscious of it, he had sown the seeds of a future which 
neither of us foresaw at that time. 


At first nothing was changed outwardly. My mother felt it her duty to 
continue my education in accordance with my father’s wishes, which meant 
that she would have me study for the civil service. For my own part, I was 
even more firmly determined than ever before that in no circumstances would I 
become a government official. 


The curriculum and teaching methods followed in the higher grade 
school were so far removed from my ideals that I became profoundly 
indifferent. Illness suddenly came to my assistance. Within a few weeks it 
decided my future and put an end to the long-standing family conflict. 


My lungs became so seriously affected that the doctor advised my mother 
very strongly not in any circumstances to allow me to take up a career which 
would necessitate working in an office. He ordered that I should give up 
attending the Realschule, for a year at least. 


What I had secretly desired for such a long time, and had persistently 
fought for, now suddenly became reality without effort on my part. Influenced 
by my illness, my mother agreed that I should leave the Realschule and attend 
the Academy. 


Those were happy days, which appeared to me almost like a dream; and 
they were doomed to remain only a dream. Two years later my mother’s death 
put a brutal end to all my fine projects. She succumbed to a long and painful 
illness which, from the very beginning, permitted little hope of recovery. 


Though expected, her death came as a terrible blow to me. I respected 
my father, but I loved my mother. 


29 


Poverty and stern reality forced me to decide promptly. The meagre 
resources of the family had been almost entirely used up through my mother’s 
severe illness. The allowance which came to me as an orphan was not enough 
for the bare necessities of life. 


Somehow or other, I would have to earn my own bread. With my clothes 
and linen packed ina valise and with an indomitable resolution in my heart, I 
left for Vienna. I hoped to forestall Fate, as my father had done fifty years 
before, I was determined to become ‘somebody’ but certainly not a civil 
servant.

CHAPTER II: LEARNING AND SUFFERING IN 
VIENNA 


I had, however, one misgiving. It seemed to me that I was better 
qualified for drawing than for painting, especially in the various branches of 
architectural drawing. At the same time my interest in architecture was 
constantly increasing, and I advanced in this direction at a still more rapid 
pace after my first visit to Vienna, which lasted two weeks. 


I was not yet sixteen years old. I went to the Hof Museum to study the 
paintings in the art gallery there; but the building itself captured almost all my 
interest. From early morning until late at night I spent all my time visiting the 
various public buildings, and it was the buildings themselves that were always 
the principal attraction for me. 


For hours and hours, I could stand in wonderment before the Opera and 
the Parliament House. The whole Ring Strasse had a magic effect upon me, as 
if it were a scene from the Arabian Nights. 


And now here I was for the second time in this beautiful city, impatiently 
waiting to hear the result of the entrance examination, but proudly confident 
that I had got through. I was so convinced of my success that when the news 
that I had failed to pass was brought to me, it struck me like a bolt from the 
blue. Yet the fact was that I had failed. 


I went to see the Rector and asked him to explain the reasons why they 
refused to accept me as a student in the general School of Painting, which was 
part of the Academy. He said that the sketches which I had brought with me 
showed unquestionably that painting was not what I was suited for, but that the 
same sketches gave clear indications of my aptitude for architectural designing. 


Therefore, the School of Painting did not come into question for me, but 
rather the School of Architecture, which also formed part of the Academy. 
They found it hard to believe that I had never been to a school for architecture 
and had never received any instruction in architectural designing. 


When I left the magnificent Hansen building, in the Schiller Platz, I was 
quite crestfallen. I felt at odds with myself for the first time in my young life, 
for what I had heard about my capabilities now appeared to me as a lightning 


33 


flash which clearly revealed a dualism under which I had been suffering for a 
long time, but for which I had hitherto been unable to account. Within a few 
days I myself also knew that I ought to become an architect, but of course the 
way was very difficult. 


I was now forced bitterly to rue my former conduct in neglecting and 
despising certain subjects at the Realschule. Before attending courses at the 
School of Architecture at the Academy it was necessary to attend the Technical 
College, but a necessary qualification for entrance to this College was a 
matriculation certificate gained at the higher grade school, which I did not 
possess. As far as one could foresee my dream of following an artistic calling 
seemed beyond the limits of possibility. 


After the death of my mother I went to Vienna for the third time. This 
visit was destined to last several years. Since I had been there before, I had 
recovered my old calm and resoluteness. My former self-assurance had come 
back, and I had my eyes steadily fixed on the goal. I was determined to be an 
architect. 


Obstacles are placed across our path in life, not to be boggled at, but to 
be surmounted, and I was fully determined to surmount these obstacles, having 
constantly before my mind the picture of my father, who had raised himself by 
his own efforts to the position of civil servant though he was the poor son of a 
village shoemaker. I had a better start, and the possibility of winning through 
was greater. 


At that time my lot in life seemed to me a harsh one; but to-day I see in it 
the wise workings of Providence. Adversity had me in its grip and often 
threatened to smash me; but the will grew stronger as the obstacles increased, 
and finally the will triumphed. 


I am thankful for that period of my life, because it hardened me and 
enabled me to be hard, and I am even more thankful because I appreciate the 
fact that I was thus saved from the emptiness of a life of ease and that a 
mother’s darling was taken from comfortable surroundings and handed over to 
Adversity as to a new mother. 


Though I then rebelled against it as too hard a fate, I am grateful that I 
was cast, against my wishes, into a world of misery and poverty and thus came 
to know the people for whom I was afterwards to fight. 


34 


It was during this period that my eyes were opened to two perils, the 
names of which I scarcely knew hitherto and had no notion whatsoever of their 
terrible significance for the existence of the German people. These two perils 
were Marxism and Judaism. 


For many people the name of Vienna signifies innocent jollity, a festive 
place for happy mortals. For me, alas, it is a living memory of the saddest 
period of my life. Even to-day, the mention of that city arouses only gloomy 
thoughts in my mind. 


The very name of that Phaeacian town spells five years of poverty—five 
years in which, first as a casual labourer and then as a poor painter, I had to 
earn my daily bread, and a meagre morsel indeed it was, not even sufficient to 
still the hunger which I constantly felt. 


That hunger was the faithful companion which never left me and shared 
in everything I did. Every book that I bought meant renewed hunger, and every 
visit I paid to the opera meant the intrusion of that inalienable companion 
during the days that followed. I was always struggling with my unsympathetic 
friend, and yet during that time I learned more than I had ever learned before. 


Apart from my architectural studies and rare visits to the opera, for 
which I had to deny myself food, I had no pleasure in life except my books. 


I read a great deal then, and I pondered deeply over what I read. All my 
free time after work was devoted exclusively to study. 


Thus, within a few years, I was able to acquire a stock of knowledge, 
which I find useful even to-day. But, over and above that, there formed in my 
mind during those years, an impression of life and a Weltanschauung. These 
became the granite basis of my conduct. I have had to add but little to what I 
then learned and made my own, and I have had to alter none of it. 


On the contrary, I am firmly convinced to-day that, generally speaking, it 
is in youth that men lay the essential groundwork of their creative thought, 
wherever that creative thought exists. 


I make a distinction between the wisdom of age—which can only arise 
from the greater profundity and foresight that are based on the experiences of a 
long life—and the creative genius of youth, which blossoms out in thought and 
ideas with inexhaustible fertility, without being able to digest these 
immediately, because of their very superabundance. 


Bis) 


These furnish the building materials and plans for the future, and it is 
from them that age takes the stones and builds the edifice, unless the so-called 
wisdom of the years has smothered the creative genius of youth. 


The life which I had hitherto led at home with my parents differed lithe 
from that of many others. I looked forward without apprehension to the 
morrow, and there was no such thing as a social problem to be faced. Those 
among whom I passed my young days belonged to the small bourgeois class. 


Therefore, it was a world that had very little contact with the world of 
genuine manual labourers, for, though at first this may appear astonishing, the 
gulf which separates that class, which is by no means economically well-off, 
from the manual labouring class is often deeper than people think. 


The reason for this division, which we may almost call enmity, lies in 
the fear that dominates a social group which has only just risen above the level 
of the manual labourer—a fear lest it may fall back into its old condition or at 
least be classed with the labourers. 


Moreover, there 1s something repulsive in remembering the cultural 
indigence of that lower class and their rough manners with one another; so that 
people who are only on the first rung of the social ladder find it unbearable to 
be forced to have any contact with the cultural level and standard of living 
beyond which they have passed. Thus, it happens that very often those who 
belong to what can really be called the upper classes find it much easier than 
do the upstarts to descend to and intermingle with their fellow-beings on the 
lowest social level, for, by the word upstart. 


I mean everyone who has raised himself through his own efforts to a 
social level higher than that to which he formerly belonged. In the case of such 
a person the hard struggle through which he has passed often destroys his 
innate human sympathy. His own fight for existence kills his sensibility to the 
misery of those who have been left behind. 


From this point of view Fate had been kind to me. Circumstances forced 
me to return to that world of poverty and economic insecurity above which my 
father had raised himself in his early days, and thus the blinkers of a narrow 
petit bourgeois education were torn from my eyes. Now for the first time I 
learned to know men and I learned to distinguish between an outer polish or 
coarse manners and the real inner nature of people. 


36 


At the beginning of the century Vienna already ranked among those cities 
where social conditions were iniquitous. Dazzling riches and loathsome 
destitution were to be found side by side. 


In the centre and in the Inner City one felt the pulse-beat of an Empire 
which had a population of fifty-two millions, with all the perilous charm of a 
State made up of multiple nationalities. 


The dazzling splendour of the Court acted like a magnet to the wealth and 
intelligence of the whole Empire, and this attraction was further strengthened 
by the centralising policy of the Habsburg monarchy itself. 


This centralising policy was necessary in order to hold together that 
hotch-potch of heterogeneous nationalities, but the result of it was an 
extraordinary concentration of higher officials in the city, which was at one and 
the same time the metropolis and imperial residence. 


Vienna was not merely the political and intellectual centre of the 
Danubian monarchy; it was also the industrial centre. In contrast to the vast 
number of military officers of high rank state officials, artists and scientists, 
there was the still vaster army of workers. Abject poverty rubbed shoulders 
with the wealth of the aristocracy and the merchant class. 


Thousands of unemployed loitered in front of the palaces on the Ring 
Strasse, and below that Via Triumphalis of the old Austria, the homeless 
huddled together in the murk and filth of the canals. 


There was hardly any other German city in which the social problem 
could be studied better than in Vienna. But here I must utter a warning against 
the illusion that this problem can be ‘studied’ from a higher social level. 


The man who has never been in the clutches of that gushing viper can 
never know what its poison is. An attempt to study it in any other way will 
result only in superficial talk and sentimental delusions. Both are harmful; the 
first, because it can never go to the root of the problem, the second, because it 
evades the question entirely. I do not know which is the more nefarious—to 
ignore social distress, as do the majority of those who have been favoured by 
fortune and those who have risen in the social scale through their own efforts, 
or the equally supercilious and often tactless, but always genteel, 
condescension displayed by people who have a craze for being charitable and 
who plume themselves on ‘sympathising with the people.’ 


37 


Of course such persons sin to a degree which they, with their lack of 
instinctive understanding, are, unable to realise, and thus they are astonished to 
find that the social conscience on which they pride themselves never produces 
any results, but often causes their good intentions to be resented, and then they 
talk of the ingratitude of the people. 


Such persons are slow to learn that social activity is something very 
different and that they cannot expect gratitude since they are not distributing 
favours, but establishing rights. I was protected against the temptation to study 
the social question in the way just mentioned, for the simple reason that I was 
forced to suffer myself. 


It was, therefore, not a question of studying the problem objectively, but 
rather one of testing its effects on myself. Though the rabbit came through the 
ordeal of the experiment, this must not be taken as evidence of its 
harmlessness. When I try to-day to recall the succession of impressions 
received during that time I find that I can do so only with approximate 
completeness. 


Here I shall describe only the more essential impressions and those 
which personally affected and often staggered me, and I shall mention the, few 
lessons I learned from this experience. At that time it was for the most part not 
very difficult to find work, because I had to seek work not as a skilled 
tradesman, but as a so-called extra-hand and had to be ready to take any job 
that turned up by chance, just for the sake of earning my daily bread. 


Thus I adopted the same attitude as, all those emigrants who shake the 
dust of Europe from their feet, with the cast-iron determination to lay the 
foundations of a new existence in the New World and acquire for themselves a 
new home. 


Liberated from all the paralysing prejudices of class and calling, 
environment and tradition, they enter any service that is open to them, 
accepting any work that comes their way, filled more and more with the idea 
that honest work never disgraced anybody, no matter what kind it may be. So I 
was resolved to enter what was for me a new world and make my way. 


I soon found out that there was always some kind of work to be got, but I 
also learned that it could just as quickly and easily be lost. The uncertainty of 
being able to earn a regular daily livelihood soon appeared to me the 
gloomiest feature in this new life upon which I had entered. 


38 


Although the skilled worker was not so frequently thrown idle as the 
unskilled worker, yet the former was by no means protected against the same 
fate; because though he might not have to face hunger as a result of 
unemployment due to the lack of demand on the labour market, the lock-out and 
the strike deprived the skilled worker of the chance to earn his bread. The 
element of uncertainty in earning one’s daily bread causes far-reaching and 
serious repercussions throughout the whole social-economic structure. 


The country lad who migrates to the big city feels attracted by what has 
been described as easy work (which it may be in reality) and shorter working 
hours and especially by the magic glamour of the big city. Accustomed in the 
country to earn a steady wage, he has been taught not to quit his former post 
until a new one is at least in view. 


As there is a great scarcity of agricultural labour, the probability of long 
unemployment in the country is very slight. It is mistake to assume that the lad 
who leaves the countryside for the town 1s not made of such sound material as 
those who remain at home to work on the land. 


On the contrary, experience shows that it is the more healthy and more 
vigorous that emigrate, and not the reverse. Among these emigrants I include 
not merely those who emigrate to America, but also the farm-hand who decides 
to leave his native village and migrate to the big city, where he will be a 
stranger. He is ready to take the risk of an uncertain fate. 


In most cases, he comes to town with a little money in his pocket and for 
the first few days he is not discouraged if he should not have the good fortune 
to find work, but if he finds a job and then loses it in a little while, the case is 
much worse. 


To find work anew, especially in winter, is often difficult and indeed 
sometimes impossible. 


For the first few weeks life is still bearable. He receives his out-of- 
work money from his trade-union and is thus enabled to carry on. But when the 
last of his own money 1s gone and his trade-union ceases to pay out because of 
prolonged unemployment, then comes real distress. He now loiters about and 
is hungry. 


Often he pawns or sells the last of his belongings. His clothes begin to 
get shabby and with the increasing shabbiness of his outward appearance he 


39 


descends to a lower social level and, in addition to his physical misery, now 
mixes with a class of human beings through whom his mind becomes poisoned. 


When he has nowhere to sleep, and if this happens in winter, as is very 
often the case, he is in dire distress. Finally he gets work, but the same story 
repeats itself a second time, then a third time, and now it is probably much 
worse. Little by little, he becomes indifferent to this everlasting insecurity. 
Finally he grows used to the repetition. 


Thus, even a man who is normally of industrious habits grows careless 
in his whole attitude towards life and gradually becomes an instrument in the 
hands of unscrupulous people who exploit him for the sake of their own 
ignoble aims. 


He has been so often thrown out of employment through no fault of his 
own that he is now more or less indifferent as to whether the strike in which he 
takes part is for the purpose of securing his economic rights or is aimed at the 
destruction of the State, the whole social order and even civilisation itself. 
Though the idea of going on strike may not be to his liking, yet he joins in out 
of sheer indifference. 


I saw this process happen before my eyes in thousands of cases and the 
longer I observed it, the greater became my dislike for that mammoth city 
which greedily attracts men to its bosom, in order to break them mercilessly in 
the end. When they came they still felt themselves in communion with their 
own people at home; if they remained that tie was broken. 


I was so buffeted about by life in the metropolis that I myself tasted the 
physical experience of such a lot and felt the effects of 1t in my own soul. One 
other thing became clear to me. The sudden change from work to idleness and 
vice versa and the constant fluctuation thus caused between earning and 
expenditure finally destroyed the sense of thrift in many people and also the 
habit of regulating expenditure in an intelligent way. 


The body appeared to grow accustomed to vicissitude, eating heartily in 
good times and going hungry in bad. Indeed hunger shatters all plans for 
regulating expenditure in better ttmes when employment has again been found. 


The reason for this is that the deprivations which the unemployed worker 
has to endure must be compensated for psychologically by a persistent mental 
mirage in which he imagines himself eating heartily once again, and this dream 


40 


develops into such a longing that it turns into a morbid impulse to cast off all 
self-restraint when work and wages turn up again. 


Therefore, the moment work is found anew he forgets to regulate the 
expenditure of his earnings but spends them to the full without thinking of the 
morrow. This leads to confusion even in the little weekly housekeeping budget, 
because the expenditure is not carefully planned. At first, the earnings will last 
perhaps for five days instead of seven; on subsequent occasions they will last 
only for three; as the habit grows, the earnings will last scarcely for a day, and 
finally they will disappear in one night. 


Often there are a wife and children at home, and in many cases it 
happens that these become infected by such a way of living, especially if the 
husband is good to them and loves them in his own way and according to his 
own lights. Then the week’s earnings are spent in common at home within two 
or three days. 


The family eats and drinks together as long as the money lasts and at the 
end of the week they hunger together. Then the wife wanders about furtively in 
the neighbourhood, borrows, a little and runs up small debts with the, 
shopkeepers, in an effort to pull through the lean days towards the end of the 
week. They sit down together to the midday meal, with only meagre fare on the 
table and often even nothing to eat. 


They wait for the corning pay-day, talking of it and making plans; and 
while they are thus hungry they dream of the plenty that is to come, and so the 
little children become acquainted with misery in their early years. 


The evil culminates when the husband goes his own way from the 
beginning and the wife protests, simply out of love for the children. 


Then there are quarrels and bad feeling and the husband takes to drink as 
he becomes more and more estranged from his wife. He now becomes drunk 
every Saturday. Fighting for her own existence and that of the children, the 
wife has to dog his footsteps on the road from the factory to the tavern in order 
to get a few shillings from him on pay-day. 


Then when he finally comes home, maybe on the Sunday or the Monday, 
having parted with his last pence, terrible scenes take place. I have had actual 
experience of all this in hundreds of cases. At first I was disgusted and 
indignant, but later on I came to recognise the whole tragedy of their misfortune 


41 


and to understand the profound causes of it. They were the unhappy victims of 
evil circumstances. 


Housing conditions were very bad at that time. In Vienna manual 
labourers lived in surroundings of appalling misery. I shudder even to-day 
when I think of the woeful dens in which people dwelt, the night-shelters and 
the slums, and all the tenebrous spectacles of ordure, loathsome filth and 
wickedness. What will happen one day when hordes of emancipated slaves 
come forth from these dens of misery to swoop down on their unthinking 
fellows? 


For unthinking they certainly are. Unthinkingly they allow things to go on 
as they are, little, dreaming, in their insensibility, that the day of reckoning must 
inevitably come, unless Fate is appeased betimes. 


To-day I thank Providence for having sent me to, such a school. There I 
could not refuse to take an interest in matters that did not please me. This 
school soon taught me a profound lesson. 


In order not to despair completely of the people among whom I then 
lived I had to differentiate between their outward appearance and their way of 
living, on the one hand, and the reasons for their development, on the other. 


Then I could bear everything without discouragement, for those who 
emerged from all this misfortune and misery, from this filth and outward 
degradation, were not human beings as such, but rather the lamentable results 
of lamentable laws. In my own life similar hardships prevented me from giving 
way to a pitying sentimentality at the sight of these degraded products which 
had finally resulted from the pressure of circumstances. The sentimental 
attitude would have been the wrong one to adopt. 


Even in those days I already saw that there was a two-fold method by 
which alone it would be possible to bring about an amelioration of these 
conditions, namely, to awaken a profound sense of social responsibility for the 
creation of a better basis for our future development, combined with a ruthless 
determination to prune away all incorrigible outgrowths. 


Just as Nature concentrates her attention, not on the preservation of what 
already exists, but on the selective breeding of offspring in order to carry on 
the species, so in human life also it is less a matter of artificially improving the 
existing generation (which, owing to human characteristics, 1s impossible in 


42 


ninety-nine cases out of a hundred), but more of securing from the very start a 
better road for future development. 


During my struggle for existence in Vienna I perceived, very clearly that 
the aim of all social activity must never be merely charitable relief, which is 
ridiculous and useless, but it must rather be a means to find a way of 
eliminating the fundamental deficiencies in our economic and cultural life, 
deficiencies which necessarily bring about the degradation of the individual or 
at least lead him towards such degradation. 


The difficulty of employing any means, even the most drastic, to 
overcome the hostility towards the State prevailing among certain criminal 
classes is largely due to an attitude of uncertainty regarding the inner motives 
and causes of this contemporary phenomenon. 


The reasons for this uncertainty are to be found ina sense of guilt for 
having permitted this tragedy of degradation. That feeling paralyses every 
serious and firm resolve and so contributes to the vacillating, and therefore 
weak and ineffectual, application of even those measures which are 
indispensable for self-preservation. 


When an age is no longer burdened with its own consciousness of blame 
in this regard, then and only then, will it have that inner tranquillity and outer 
strength necessary to cut off drastically and ruthlessly all parasite growth and 
root out the weeds. Because the Austrian State had almost no sense of social 
right or social legislation its inability to abolish those evil outgrowths was 
manifest. 


I do not know what appalled me most at that time; the economic misery 
of those who were, then my companions, their crude customs and morals, or 
the low level of their culture. 


How often does our bourgeoisie rise up in moral indignation on hearing 
from the mouth of some pitiable tramp that it 1s all the same to him whether he 
be a German or not, and that he will feel at home wherever he can get enough 
to keep body and soul together. They bewail such a lack of ‘national pride’ and 
express their horror at such sentiments. But how many people really ask 
themselves why it is that their own sentiments are better? 


How many of them understand that their natural pride in being members 
of so favoured a nation arises from the innumerable succession of instances 


43 


they have encountered which remind them of the greatness of their country and 
their nation in all spheres of artistic and cultural life? How many of them 
realise that pride in their country is largely dependent on knowledge of its 
greatness in all those spheres? 


Do our bourgeois circles ever think what a ridiculously meagre share the 
people have in that knowledge which 1s a necessary prerequisite for the feeling 
of pride in one’s country? 


It cannot be objected here that in other countries similar conditions exist 
and that nevertheless the working classes in those countries have remained 
patriotic. Even if that were so, it would be no excuse for our negligent, 
attitude, but it is not so. What we call chauvinistic education—in the case of 
the French people, for example is only the excessive exaltation of the greatness 
of France in all spheres of culture or, as the French say, civilisation. 


The French boy is not educated on purely objective principles. 
Wherever the importance of the political and cultural greatness of his country 
is concerned, he is taught in the most subjective way imaginable. Education 
ought always to be on broad, general lines and these ought to be deeply 
engraved, by constant repetition if necessary, on the memories and feelings of 
the people. In our case, however, we are not merely guilty of sins of omission, 
but also of positively perverting the little which some individuals had the luck 
to learn at school. The rats that poison our body politic gnaw from the hearts 
and memories of the broad masses even that little which distress and misery 
have left. 


Let the reader try to picture the following: 


There is a lodging in a cellar and this lodging consists of two damp 
rooms. In these rooms a workman and his family live seven people in all. Let 
us assume that one of the children is a boy of three. That is the age at which 
children, first become conscious of the impressions which they receive. In the 
case of highly gifted people traces of the impressions received in those early 
years remain in the memory up to an advanced age. 


Now, the narrowness and congestion of those living quarters are not 
conducive to pleasant relations and thus quarrels and fits of mutual anger arise. 
These people can hardly be said to live with one another, but rather on top of 
one another. The small misunderstandings which disappear of themselves ina 
home where there is enough space for people to get away from one another for 


44 


a while, here become the source of chronic disputes. As far as the children are 
concerned the situation is tolerable from this point of view. 


In such conditions, they are constantly quarrelling with one another, but 
the quarrels are quickly and easily forgotten, but when the parents fall out with 
one another daily bickerings often develop into rudeness; such as cannot be 
adequately imagined. The results of such experiences must become apparent 
later on in the children. 


One must have practical experience of such a milieu in order to be able 
to picture the state of affairs that arises from such mutual recriminations when 
the father assaults the mother and maltreats her in a fit of drunken rage. 


At the age of six the unfortunate child begins to be aware of sordid facts 
which an adult would find revolting infected with moral poison, 
undernourished in body and with its poor little head alive with vermin, the 
young ‘citizen’ goes to the primary school. With difficulty he barely learns to 
read and write. There is no possibility of learning any lessons at home. 


On the contrary, the father and mother themselves talk before the children 
in the most disparaging way about the teacher and the school and they are much 
more inclined to insult the teachers than to put their offspring across their knee 
and knock sound reason into him. 


What the little fellow hears at home does not tend to increase his respect 
for his human surroundings. Here nothing good is said of human nature as a 
whole and every institution, from the school to the government, is reviled. No 
matter what the subject, religion or morals, the State or the social order, they 
rail against them all and drag them down into the dirt. 


When the lad leaves school, at the age of fourteen, it would be difficult 
to say what are the most striking features of his character, incredible ignorance 
in so far as real knowledge is concerned or cynical impudence combined with 
an attitude towards morality which is really startling in one so young. 


What position can a person fill in the world which he is about to enter, if 
to him nothing is sacred, if he has never come into contact with anything noble 
but, on the contrary, has been intimately acquainted with the lowest kind of 
human existence? 


The child of three has got into the habit of reviling all authority by the 
time he is fifteen. He has been acquainted only with moral filth and vileness, 


45 


everything being excluded that might stimulate his thoughts towards higher 
things. Now this young specimen of humanity enters the school of life. 


He leads the same kind of life which was exemplified for him by his 
father during his childhood. He loiters about the streets and comes home at all 
hours. He even blackguards that broken-hearted being who gave him birth. 


He curses God and the world and finally ends up in a reformatory for 
young people where he acquires the final polish, and his bourgeois 
contemporaries are astonished at the lack of ‘patriotic enthusiasm’ which this 
young ‘citizen’ displays. 


Day after day the bourgeois world sees how poison is spread among the 
people through the medium of the theatre, the cinema, gutter journalism and 
obscene books, and yet they are astonished at the deplorable ‘moral standards’ 
the ‘lack of national feeling’ among the masses—as if the overdone 
sentimentality of the cinema, rubbishy papers and suchlike could lay a 
foundation for recognition of the greatness of one’s country, apart entirely from 
the earlier education which the individual has received. 


I then came to understand, quickly and thoroughly, what I had never been 
aware of before, namely, that the question of ‘nationalizing’ a people is first 
and foremost one of establishing sound social conditions which will furnish the 
foundation necessary for the education of the individual, for only when family 
upbringing and school education have inculcated upon the mind of the 
individual a knowledge of the cultural and economic and, above all, of the 
political greatness of his own country—then, and then only, will it be possible 
for him to feel proud of being a citizen of that country. 


I can fight only for something that I love. I can love only what I respect, 
and in order to respect a thing I must at least have some knowledge of it. 


As soon as my interest in social questions was once awakened I began to 
study them thoroughly. A new and hitherto unknown world was thus revealed to 
me. 


In the years 1909-10, I had so far improved my position that I no longer 
had to earn my daily bread as a manual labourer. I was now working 
independently in a small way, as a painter in water colours. This métier was a 
poor one indeed as far as earnings were concerned, for these were only 
sufficient to pay for the bare necessities of life, yet it had an interest for me, in 


46 


view of the profession to which I aspired. 


Moreover, when I came home in the evenings, I was now no longer 
dead-tired as formerly, when I used to be unable to open a book without falling 
asleep almost immediately. 


My present occupation was, therefore, in line with the profession I 
aimed at for the future. Moreover, I was master of my own time and could 
arrange my working-hours better than formerly. I painted in order to earn my 
bread, and I studied because I liked it. 


Thus I was able to acquire that theoretical knowledge of the social 
problem which was a necessary complement to what I was learning through 
actual experience. I studied all the books which I could find that dealt with this 
question and I thought deeply on what I read. I think that the people among 
whom I then lived considered me an eccentric person. 


Besides my interest in the social question I naturally devoted myself with 
enthusiasm to the study of architecture. Side by side with music, I considered it 
queen of the arts. To study it was for me not work but pleasure. I could read or 
draw into the small hours of the morning without ever getting tired, and I 
became more and more confident that my dream of a brilliant future would 
come true, even though I should have to wait long years for its fulfilment. I was 
firmly convinced that one day I should make a name for myself as an architect. 


The fact that, side by side with my professional studies, I took the 
greatest interest in everything that had to do with politics did not seem to me to 
signify anything of great importance. On the contrary, I looked upon this 
practical interest in politics merely as part of an elementary obligation that 
devolves on every thinking man. Those who have no understanding of the 
political world around them have no right to criticise or complain. 


On political questions, therefore, I still continued to read and study a 
great deal, but ‘reading’ had probably a different significance for me from that 
which it has for the average run of our so-called ‘intellectuals.’ 


I know people who read interminably, book after book, page after page, 
and yet I should not call them ‘well-read.’ Of course they ‘know’ an immense 
amount, but their brain seems incapable of assorting and classifying the 
material which they have gathered, from books. 


They have not the faculty of distinguishing between what is of value and 


47 


what is worthless in a book, in order that they may retain the former in their 
minds, and if possible, skip over the latter while reading or, if that be not 
possible, when once read, throw it overboard as useless ballast. 


Reading is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. Its chief purpose is 
to help towards filling in the framework which is made up of the talents and 
capabilities that each individual possesses. 


Thus each one procures for himself the implements and materials 
necessary for the fulfilment of his calling in life, no matter whether this be the 
elementary task of earning one’s daily bread or a career taken up in response to 
a higher call. 


Such is the first purpose of reading, and the second purpose is to give us 
a general knowledge of the world in which we live. In both cases, however, 
the material which we have acquired through reading must not be stored up in 
the memory on a plan that corresponds to the successive chapters of the book, 
but each little piece of knowledge thus gained must be treated as if it were a 
little stone to be inserted into a mosaic, so that it finds its proper place among 
all the other pieces and particles that help to forma general world-picture in 
the brain of the reader. 


Otherwise, only a confused jumble of chaotic notions will result from all 
reading, and this jumble is not merely useless, but it also tends to make the 
unfortunate possessor of it conceited, for he seriously considers himself a 
well-educated person and thinks that he understands something of life. 


He believes that he has acquired knowledge, whereas the truth is that 
every increase in such ‘knowledge’ draws him more and more away from real 
life, until he finally ends up in some sanatorium or takes to politics and 
becomes a member of parliament. 


Such a person never succeeds in turning his knowledge to practical 
account when the opportune moment arrives, for his mental equipment is not 
ordered according to the broad lines of human existence, but in the order of 
succession in which he read the books and their contents is stored in his mind. 


If Fate should one day call upon him to use some of his book-knowledge 
for certain practical purposes in life, Fate would have to name the book and 
give the number of the page, for the poor noodle himself would never be able 
to find the spot where he gathered the information now called for; but since the 


48 


page is not mentioned at, the critical moment the wise fool finds himself ina 
state of hopeless embarrassment. 


In a high state of agitation he searches for analogous cases and it is 
almost certain that he will finally hit on the wrong prescription. 


Were this not so, there could be no explanation for the political 
achievements of our highly-placed government officials, unless we assume that 
they are due to malice and chicanery rather than to pathological weakness. 


On the other hand, a man who has cultivated the art of reading will 
instantly discern, in a book, a journal or a pamphlet, what ought to be 
remembered because it meets his personal needs or is of value as general 
knowledge. 


What he thus learns is incorporated in his mental conception of this or 
that problem or thing, further correcting the mental picture or enlarging it so 
that it becomes more exact and precise. Should some practical problem 
suddenly demand examination or solution, memory will immediately select the 
requisite information from the mass that has been acquired through years of 
reading and will place this information at the service of a man’s powers of 
judgment so he may gain a new and clearer view of the problem, or even solve 
it. 


Only thus can reading have any meaning or value. 


The speaker, for example, who has not the sources of information ready 
to hand which are necessary to a proper treatment of his subject, is unable to 
defend his opinions against an opponent, even though those opinions be 
perfectly sound and true. 


In every discussion his memory will leave him shamefully in the lurch. 
He cannot summon up arguments to support his statements or to refute his 
opponent. So long as the speaker has only to defend himself on his own 
personal account, the situation is not serious, but the evil arises when Fate 
places at the head of public affairs such a soi-disant know-all, who in reality 
knows nothing. 


From early youth I endeavoured to read books in the right way and I was 
fortunate in having a good memory and intelligence to assist me. From that 
point of view my sojourn in Vienna was particularly useful and profitable. My 
daily experiences there were a constant stimulus to study the most diverse 


49 


problems from new angles. 


Inasmuch as I was in a position to put theory to the test of reality and 
reality to the test of theory, I was safe from the danger of losing myself ina 
haze of theories on the one hand, and of becoming superficial, on the other. 


My everyday experiences at that time made me determined to make a 
fundamental theoretical study of two most important questions, apart from the 
social question. It is impossible to say when I might have started to make a 
thorough study of the doctrine and characteristics of Marxism, were it not for 
the fact that I then literally pitched head foremost into the problem. 


What I knew of Social Democracy in my youth was precious little and 
that little was for the most part wrong. The fact that it led the struggle for 
universal suffrage and the secret ballot gave me an inner satisfaction, for my 
reason then told me that this would weaken the Habsburg regime, which I so 
thoroughly detested. 


I was convinced that except at the cost of sacrificing the German 
element, the Danubian State could not continue to exist. Even a long and steady 
Slavisation of the Austrian Germans would not have constituted a guarantee 
that the Empire would endure, because it was very questionable if, and how 
far, the Slays possessed the necessary capacity for preserving the State as such. 
Therefore, I welcomed every movement that might lead towards the final 
disruption of that impossible State which, to continue to exist, would have to 
stamp out the German character in ten million people. 


The more this babel of tongues wrought discord and disruption, even in 
the parliament, the nearer did the hour approach for the dissolution of this 
Babylonian Empire. That would mean the liberation of my German-Austrian 
people and only then would it become possible for them to be re-united with 
the mother country. 


Accordingly, I had no feeling of antipathy towards the actual policy of 
the Social Democrats. That its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the 
working classes (which, in my ignorance, I then foolishly believed) was a 
further point in favour of Social Democracy rather than against it,) but the 
feature that contributed most to estrange me from the Social Democratic 
movement was its hostile attitude towards the struggle for the preservation of 
Germanism in Austria and its undignified wooing of the Slav ‘comrades,’ who 
received these approaches favourably as long as any, practical advantages 


50 


were forthcoming, but otherwise maintained a haughty reserve, thus giving the 
suitors the answer their behaviour deserved. 


So it happened that, at the age of seventeen, the word ‘Marxism’ was 
very little known to me, while I looked on ‘Social Democracy’ and ‘Socialism’ 
as Synonymous expressions. It was only as the result of a sudden blow from the 
rough hand of Fate that my eyes were opened to the nature of this unparalleled 
system of duping the public. 


Hitherto my acquaintance with the Social Democratic Party had only 
been that of a mere spectator at some of their mass meetings. I had not the 
slightest idea of the Social Democratic doctrine or of the mentality of its 
partisans but now was suddenly brought face to face with the products of its 
teaching and what was called its Weltanschauung. 


In this way a few months sufficed for me to learn something which in 
other circumstances might have required years of study namely, that under the 
cloak of social virtue and love of one’s neighbour a veritable pestilence was 
spreading abroad and that if this pestilence were not stamped out without delay 
it might eventually succeed in exterminating the human race. 


I first came into contact with the Social Democrats while working in the 
building trade. From the very moment I started work the situation was not very 
pleasant for me. My clothes were still rather decent, I was careful of my 
speech and I was reserved in manner. 


I was so occupied with thinking of my own present lot and future 
prospects that I did not take much interest in my immediate surroundings. I had 
sought work so that I should not starve and at the same time so as to be able to 
make further headway with my studies, though this headway might be slow. 


Possibly I should not have bothered about my companions had it not been 
that on the third or fourth day an event occurred which forced me to take a 
definite stand. I was called upon to join the trade-union. 


At that time I knew nothing about the trade-unions. I had had no 
opportunity of forming an opinion on their utility or inutility, as the case might 
be, but when I was told that I must join the union, I refused. 


The grounds which I gave for my refusal were simply that I knew nothing 
about the matter and that anyhow I would not allow myself to be forced into 
anything. Probably the former reason saved me from being thrown out right 


51 


away. 


They probably thought that within a few days I might be converted or 
become more docile, but if they thought so, they were profoundly mistaken. 
After two weeks I found it utterly impossible for me to take such a step, even if 
I had been willing to take it at first. 


During those fourteen days I came to know my fellow workmen better, 
and no power in the world could have moved me to join an organisation whose 
representatives had meanwhile shown themselves in a light which I found so 
unfavourable. 


At first, my resentment was aroused. At midday some, of my fellow, 
workers used to adjourn to the nearest tavern, while the others remained on the 
building premises and there ate their midday meal, which was in most cases a 
very scanty one. These were the married men whose wives brought them their 
midday soup in dilapidated vessels. Towards the end of the week there was a 
gradual increase in the number of those who remained to eat their midday meal 
on the building premises. I understood the reason for this afterwards. They 
now talked politics. 


I drank my bottle of milk and ate my morsel of bread somewhat apart 
from the others, while I circumspectly studied my environment or else fell to 
meditating on my own harsh lot. Yet I heard more than enough, and I often 
thought that much of what they said was meant for my ears, in the hope of 
making me adopt a definite attitude, but all that I heard had the effect of 
arousing the strongest antagonism in me. 


Everything was disparaged the nation, because it was held to be an 
invention of the ‘capitalist’ class (how often I had to listen to that phrase!); the 
Fatherland, because it was held to be an instrument in the hands of the 
bourgeoisie for the exploitation of the working classes; the authority of the law, 
because that was a means of oppressing the proletariat; the school system, as a 
means of training not only slaves, but also slave-drivers; religion, as a means 
of doping the people, in order to exploit them afterwards; morality, as the 
badge of stupid and sheepish docility. There was nothing that they did not drag 
in the mud. 


At first I remained silent, but that could not last very long. Then I began 
to take part in the discussion and to reply to their statements. I had to 
recognise, however, that this was bound to be entirely fruitless, as long as I did 


a2 


not have at least a certain amount of definite information about the questions 
that were discussed. 


I therefore decided to consult the sources from which they claimed to 
have drawn their so-called wisdom, and, with this end in view, I studied book 
after book, pamphlet after pamphlet. 


Meanwhile, we argued with one another on the building premises. Day 
by day I was becoming better informed than my companions on the subjects on 
which they claimed to be informed. 


Then a day came when the more redoubtable of my adversaries resorted 
to the most effective weapon they had to replace the force of reason, namely, 
intimidation and physical force. Some of the leaders among my adversaries 
ordered me to leave the building or else allow myself to be flung off the 
scaffolding. 


As I was quite alone I could not put up any effective resistance, so I 
chose the first alternative and departed, having, however, learned a lesson. 


I went away full of disgust, but at the same time so deeply moved that it 
was quite impossible for me to turn my back on the whole situation and think 
no more about it. When my anger began to calm down, the spirit of obstinacy 
got the upper hand and I decided that at all costs I would get back to work 
again, in the building trade. 


This decision became all the stronger a few weeks later, when my little 
savings had entirely run out and hunger clutched me once again in its merciless 
grip. I had no alternative. I got work again and had to leave for the same 
reasons as before. 


I tortured myself with the question, ‘Are these men worthy to belong to a 
great people?’ The question is profoundly disturbing, for if the answer 1s in the 
affirmative, then the struggle to defend one’s nationality is no longer worth all 
the trouble and sacrifice we demand of our best elements if it be on behalf of 
such a rabble. 


On the other hand, if the answer is in the negative, then our nation is poor 
in human material. After days spent in such meditation and introspection, I was 
depressed and saw before my mind’s eye the ever-increasing and menacing 
army of people who could no longer be reckoned as belonging to their own 
nation. 


53 


It was with changed feelings, that, some days later, I gazed on the 
interminable ranks of Viennese workmen parading four abreast, at a mass 
demonstration. I stood dumbfounded for almost two hours, watching that 
enormous human dragon which slowly uncoiled itself there before me. When I 
finally left the square and wandered in the direction of my lodgings I felt 
dismayed and depressed. 


On my way I noticed the Arbeiterzeitung (“The Workers’ Journal’’) ina 
tobacco shop. This was the chief press-organ of the old Austrian Social 
Democracy. In a cheap cafe, where the common people used to forgather and 
where I often went to read the papers, the Arbeiterzeitung was also displayed. 


Hitherto I had not been able to bring myself to do more than glance at the 
wretched thing for a couple of minutes, for its whole tone was a sort of mental 
vitriol to me. Under the depressing influence of the demonstration I had 
witnessed, some interior voice urged me to buy the paper in that tobacco shop 
and read it through. 


So I took it home with me and spent a whole evening reading it, despite 
the steadily mounting rage provoked by this ceaseless outpouring of 
falsehoods. 


I now found that in the social democratic daily papers I could study the 
inner character of this movement much better than in all their theoretical 
literature. 


What a discrepancy between the two, between the literary effusions 
which dealt with the theory of Social Democracy and their high-sounding 
phraseology about liberty, human dignity and beauty, the air of profound 
wisdom, the disgusting moral pose and the brazen prophetic assurance—a 
meticulously woven glitter of words, to dazzle and mislead the reader and, on 
the other hand, the daily press spreading this new doctrine of human 
redemption in the most vile fashion! 


No means was too base, provided it could be exploited in the campaign 
of slander. These journalists were real virtuosos in the art of twisting facts and 
presenting them in a deceptive form. The theoretical literature was intended for 
the simpletons of the soi-disant intelligentsia of the middle and upper classes. 
The newspaper propaganda was intended for the masses. 


This probing into books and newspapers and the study of the teachings of 


54 


Social Democracy reawakened my love for my own, people, and thus what at 
first seemed an impassable gulf became the occasion of a closer affection. 


Having once understood the working of the colossal system for 
poisoning the popular mind, only a fool could blame the victims of it. During 
the years that followed I became more independent, and as I did so, I became 
better able to understand the inner cause of the success achieved by this Social 
Democratic gospel. 


I now realised the meaning and purpose of those brutal orders which 
prohibited the reading of all books and newspapers that were not ‘Red’ and at 
the same time demanded that only the ‘Red’ meetings should be attended. In the 
clear light of reality I was able to see what must have been the inevitable 
consequences of that intolerant teaching. 


The mentality of the broad masses is accessible only to what is strong 
and uncompromising. Like woman whose inner sensibilities are not under the 
sway of abstract reasoning, but are always subject to the influence of a vague 
emotional longing for the strength that completes her being, and who would 
rather bow to the strong man than dominate the weakling—in like manner the 
masses of the people prefer the ruler to the suppliant, and are well-led witha 
stronger sense of mental security by a teaching that brooks no rival, than by one 
which offers them a liberal freedom. 


They have very little idea of how to use that freedom, and thus they are 
prone to feel that they have been abandoned. They feel very little shame at 
being terrorised intellectually and they are scarcely conscious of the fact that 
their freedom as human beings is impudently abused, nor have they the slightest 
suspicion of the intrinsic fallacy of the whole doctrine. They see only the 
ruthless force and brutality of its determined utterances, to which they always 
submit. 


If Social Democracy is opposed by a more truthful teaching, then, even 
though the struggle be of the most bitter kind, this truthful teaching will finally 
prevail, provided it be enforced with equal ruthlessness. 


Within less than two years I had gained a clear understanding of Social 
Democracy, its teaching and its weapons. 


I recognised the infamy of that technique whereby the movement carried 
on a campaign of mental terrorism against the bourgeoisie, which is neither 


5D 


morally nor spiritually equipped to withstand such attacks. The tactics of 
Social Democracy consisted in opening, at a given signal, a veritable barrage 
of lies and calumnies against the man whom they believed to be the most 
redoubtable of their adversaries, until the nerves of the bourgeoisie gave way 
and they sacrificed the man who was attacked, simply in the hope of being 
allowed to live in peace. 


But the hope always proved to be a foolish one for they were never left 
in peace. The same tactics were repeated again and again, until fear of these 
ruthless fanatics exercised, by sheer force of suggestion, a paralysing effect on 
their victims. Through its own experience, Social Democracy learned the value 
of strength and for that reason it attacks mostly those in whom it senses real 
mettle, which is indeed a very rare possession. 


On the other hand, it praises every weakling among its adversaries, more 
or less cautiously according to the measure of his mental qualities, known or 
assumed. They have less fear of a man of genius who lacks will-power, than of 
a vigorous character of mediocre intelligence, and at the same time they highly 
commend those who are devoid of both intelligence and will-power. 


The Social Democrats know how to create the impression that they alone 
are the protectors of peace. In this way, acting very circumspectly, but never 
losing sight of their ultimate goal, they conquer one position after another, at 
one time by methods of quiet intimidation, and at another, by sheer daylight 
robbery, employing these latter tactics at those moments when public attention 
is turned towards other matters from which it does not wish to be diverted, or 
when the public considers an incident too trivial to create a scandal and thus 
provoke the anger of a malignant opponent. 


These tactics are based on an accurate estimation of human frailties and 
must lead to success, with almost mathematical certainty, unless the other side 
also learns how to fight poison gas with poison gas. Weaker elements must be 
told that here it is a question of to be or not to be. 


I also came to understand that physical intimidation has its significance 
for the mass as well as for the individual. Here again, the psychological effect 
has been calculated to a nicety. Intimidation in workshops and in factories, in 
assembly halls and at mass demonstrations, will always meet with success as 
long as it does not have to encounter the same kind of intimidation in a stronger 
form. 


56 


Then, of course, the Social Democratic Party will raise a horrified 
outcry and appeal to the authority of the State, which it has just repudiated and 
will, in most cases, quietly achieve its aim amid the general confusion, namely, 
to discover some bovine creature holding an important government position, 
who, in a vain attempt to curry favour with the dreaded opponent in case of 
future trouble, is ready to finish off those who dare to oppose this world 
enemy. 


The impression which such successful tactics makes on the minds of the 
broad masses, whether they be adherents or opponents, can be estimated only 
by one who knows the popular mind, not from books, but from practical life, 
for the successes which are thus obtained are taken by the adherents of Social 
Democracy as a triumph of the righteousness of their own cause; on the other 
hand, the beaten opponent very often loses faith in the effectiveness of any 
further resistance. 


The more I understood the methods of physical intimidation that were 
employed, the more sympathy I had for the multitude that had succumbed to it. I 
am thankful now for the ordeal which I had to go through at that time; for it was 
the means of bringing me to think kindly again of my own people, inasmuch as 
the experience enabled me to distinguish between the false leaders and the 
victims who have been led astray, for those who had been misled in this way 
can only be described as victims. 


If I attempted to give a faithful picture of those on the lowest rung of the 
social ladder, my picture would be incomplete, if I did not add that even in the 
social depths I still found light in the shape ofa rare spirit of self-sacrifice and 
loyal comradeship, contentment and a modest reserve. 


This was true especially of the older generation of workmen. Although 
these qualities were disappearing more and more in the younger generation, 
owing to the all-pervading influence of the big city, yet among the younger 
generation also, there were many who were fundamentally sound and who 
were able to maintain themselves uncontaminated amid the sordid surroundings 
of their everyday existence. 


If these men, who in many cases meant well and were upright in 
themselves, were, as far as their political activities were concerned, in the 
ranks of the mortal enemy of our people, that was because they, as decent 
workpeople did not and could not grasp the downright infamy of the doctrine 


a7. 


taught by the socialist agitators. 


Furthermore, it was because no other section of the community bothered 
itself about the lot of the working classes, and social conditions finally proved 
more powerful than any feelings which might have led them to adopt a different 
attitude. A day was bound to come when want gained the upper hand and drove 
them to join, the Social Democrats. 


On innumerable occasions the bourgeoisie took a definite stand against 
even the most legitimate human demands of the working classes. This line of 
conduct was not only ill-judged and indeed immoral, but the bourgeoisie did 
not even stand to gain by it. The result was that even the honest workman 
abandoned the original concept of the trade-union organisation and was 
dragged into politics. 


There were millions of workmen who began by being hostile to the 
Social Democratic Party, but their defences were repeatedly stormed and 
finally they had to surrender. Yet this defeat was due to the stupidity of the 
bourgeois parties, who had opposed every social demand put forward by the 
working classes. The short-sighted refusal to support attempts to improve 
labour conditions, the refusal to adopt measures for the prevention of accidents 
in the factories, the refusal to forbid child labour, the refusal to consider 
protective measures for female workers, especially expectant mothers—all 
this was of assistance to the Social Democratic leaders, who were thankful for 
every opportunity which they could exploit for forcing the masses into their 
net. 


Our bourgeois parties can never repair the damage that resulted from the 
mistake they then made, for they sowed the seeds of hatred when they opposed 
all efforts at social, reform and thus, to all outward appearances, at least, lent 
colour to the claim put forward by the arch-enemy of our people: that only the 
Social Democrats protected. 


In this way it provided the moral justification of the actual existence of 
the trade-union, which was, from the outset, the chief political recruiting 
ground for the Social Democratic Party. 


During those years in Vienna, I was forced, whether I liked it or not, to 
decide on the attitude I should take towards the trade-union. Because I looked 
upon them as inseparable from the Social Democratic Party, my decision was 
hasty and mistaken. I repudiated them as a matter of course, but on this, 


58 


essential question, too, Fate intervened and gave me a lesson, with the result 
that I changed the opinion which I had first formed. 


When I was twenty years old I had learned to distinguish between the 
trade-union as a means of defending the social rights of the employees and of 
fighting for better living conditions for them and, on the other hand, the trade- 
union as a political instrument used by the party in the class struggle. 


The fact that the Social Democrats grasped the enormous importance of 
the trade-union movement, secured for them a weapon which they used with 
success, whereas the bourgeois parties by their failure to understand it, lost 
their political prestige. 


They thought that their own arrogant ‘veto’ would arrest the logical 
development of the movement, but what they actually did was to produce an 
illogical development. It is absurd and also untrue to say that the trade-union 
movement was in itself hostile to the nation. 


To maintain the opposite would be more correct. If the activities of the 
trade-union are directed towards improving the condition of a class, which is a 
mainstay of the nation, and succeed in doing so, such activities are not directed 
against the Fatherland or the State but are, in the truest sense of the word, 
national. 


In that way, the trade-union organisation helps to create the social 
conditions which are indispensable in a general system of national education. 
It deserves high recognition when it destroys the psychological and physical 
germs of social disease and thus contributes to the general welfare of the 
nation. It is, therefore, superfluous to ask whether the trade-union is 
indispensable. So long as there are employers who lack social understanding 
and have false ideas of justice and fair play, it is not only the right, but also the 
duty, of their employees (who are, after all, an integral part of our people) to 
protect the general interests against the greed and unreason of the individual. 


To safeguard the loyalty and confidence of the people is as much in the 
interests of the nation as to safeguard public health. Both are seriously 
menaced by dishonourable employers who are not conscious of their duty as 
members of the national community. 


Their personal avidity or ruthlessness sows the seeds of future trouble. 
To eliminate the causes of such a development is an action that deserves the 


59 


approbation of the country, and not the reverse. 


It is useless to argue that the individual workman is free at any time to 
escape from the consequences of an injustice which he has actually suffered, or 
thinks he has suffered, at the hands of an employer—in other words, he can 
leave. That argument is only a ruse to distract attention from the question at 
issue. 


Is it, or 1s it not, in the interests of the nation to remove the causes of 
social unrest? If it is, then the fight must be carried on with the only weapons 
that promise success. 


The individual workman is never ina position to stand up against the 
might of the big employer, for the question here is not one that concerns the 
triumph of right since, if right had been recognised as the guiding principle, the 
conflict could not have arisen at all. 


But here it 1s a question of who is the stronger. If it were otherwise, a 
sense of justice would, in itself, lead to an honourable settlement of the 
dispute, or, to put the case more correctly, such a dispute would never have 
arisen. 


If unsocial and dishonourable treatment of men provokes resistance, then 
the stronger party will win through in the conflict, until the constitutional 
legislative authorities do away with the evil through legislation. 


Therefore it is evident that, only if the individual workmen combine 
against the individual employer as representing the concentrated force of the 
undertaking, can they hope not to be doomed to defeat from the outset. 


Thus the trade-unions can help to inculcate and strengthen a sense of 
social responsibility in daily life and open the way to practical results. In 
doing this they tend to remove those causes of friction which are a continual 
source of discontent and complaint. 


The blame for the fact that the trade-unions do not fulfil this much- 
desired function must be laid at the doors of those who barred the road to 
legislative social reform, or rendered such a reform ineffective by sabotaging 
it through their political influence. Since the political bourgeoisie failed to 
understand—or, rather, did not wish to understand—the importance of the 
trade-union movement, the Social Democrats seized the advantage offered 
them by this mistaken policy and took the trade-unions under their exclusive 


60 


protection, without any protest from the other side. 


In this way they established for themselves a solid bulwark behind 
which they could safely retire whenever the struggle assumed a critical aspect. 
Thus the genuine purpose of the movement gradually fell into oblivion, and 
was replaced by new objectives, for the Social Democrats never have, the 
slightest intention of upholding the original purpose for which the trade-union 
movement was founded. 


Within a, few decades the trade-union movement was transformed, by the 
expert hand of Social Democracy, from an instrument which had been 
originally fashioned for the defence of human rights into an instrument for the 
destruction of the national economic structure. 


The interests of the working class were not for one moment permitted to 
interfere with this aim, for, in the political sphere the application of economic 
pressure always renders extortion, successful, if the one side be sufficiently 
unscrupulous and the other sufficiently inert and docile. In this case both these 
conditions were fulfilled. 


By the beginning of the present century the trade-unionist movement had 
already ceased to serve the purpose for which it had been founded. From year 
to year it fell more and more under the political control of the Social 
Democrats, until it finally came to be used solely as a battering-ram in the 
class struggle. 


The plan was to shatter, by means of constantly repeated blows, the 
economic edifice on the building of which so much time and care had been 
expended. Once this objective had been reached, the destruction of the State 
would become easier, because the State would already have been deprived of 
its economic foundations. 


It became less and less a question of protecting the real interests of the 
workers, until political acumen no longer deemed it advisable to supply the 
social and cultural needs of the broad masses, Since there was a danger that if 
these masses once felt content they could no longer be employed as mere 
passive material in the political struggle. 


The, mere prospect of such a development caused such anxiety among 
the leaders in the class-warfare, that they eventually rejected and inveighed 
against every genuinely beneficial social reform, and conditions were such that 


61 


these leaders did not have to trouble to justify such an illogical policy. 


As the masses were taught to increase and raise their demands, the 
possibility of satisfying them dwindled, and whatever ameliorative measures 
were taken seemed less and less significant, so that it was always possible to 
persuade the masses that this ridiculous degree in which the most sacred 
claims of the working classes were being granted, represented a diabolical 
plane to weaken their fighting power and, if possible, to paralyse it. In view of 
the limited thinking capacity of the broad masses, the success achieved is not 
to be wondered at. 


In the bourgeois camp there was high indignation over the dishonesty of 
the Social Democratic tactics, but not even the most tentative steps were taken 
to lay down guiding principles for their own line of conduct in the light of this. 


The refusal of the Social Democrats, to improve the miserable living 
conditions of the working classes, ought to have induced the bourgeois parties 
to make the most energetic efforts in this direction and to snatch from the hands 
of the class-warfare leaders their most precious weapon; but nothing of this 
kind happened. 


Instead of attacking the position of its adversaries the bourgeoisie 
allowed itself to be pressed and hurried. Finally, it adopted means that were so 
tardy and so insignificant that they were ineffective and were rejected. So the 
whole situation remained just as it had been before the bourgeois intervention, 
except that the discontent had increased. 


Like a threatening storm, the ‘free trade-union’ hung above the political 
horizon and overshadowed the life of each individual, It was one of the most 
frightful instruments of terror that threatened the security and independence of 
the national economic structure, the stability of the State and the liberty of the 
individual. 


Above all, it was the ‘free trade-union’ that turned democracy into a 
ridiculous term, insulted the ideal of liberty and derided that of fraternity with 
the slogan, ‘If you won’t become one of us, we’ll crack your skull.’ 


Thus did I come to know this friend of humanity. During the years that 
followed, my knowledge was widened and deepened, but I never felt called 
upon to alter my original opinion. The more became acquainted with the 
external forms of Social Democracy, the greater became my desire to 


62 


understand the inner nature of its doctrines. 


For this purpose the official literature of the party was of little use. In 
discussing economic questions, its statements were false and its proofs 
unsound. In treating of political aims its attitude was insincere. 


Furthermore, its modern methods of chicanery in the presentation of its 
arguments were profoundly repugnant to me. Its flamboyant sentences, its 
obscure and incomprehensible phrases, pretended to contain great thoughts, but 
they were devoid of meaning. 


One would have had to be a decadent Bohemian in one of our modern 
cities in order to feel at home in that labyrinth of nonsense, or enjoy ‘intimate 
experiences’ amid the stinking fumes of this literary Dadaism. These writers 
were obviously counting on the proverbial humility of a certain section of our 
people, who believe that a person who is incomprehensible must be 
profoundly wise. 


By comparing the theoretical falsity and absurdity of that doctrine with 
the reality of its external manifestations, I gradually came to have a clear idea 
of its final aims. During such moments | had dark presentiments and feared 
something evil. I had before me a teaching inspired by egotism and hatred, 
calculated to win its victory, the winning of which would be a mortal blow to 
humanity. 


Meanwhile, I had discovered the relationship existing between this 
destructive teaching and the specific character of a people, who up to that time 
had been to me almost unknown. 


Knowledge of the Jews is the only key to a true understanding of the 
inner nature, and, therefore, the real aims, of Social Democracy. 


The man who has come to know this race has succeeded in removing 
from his eyes the veil through which he had seen the aims and meaning of this 
party in a false light; then, out of the murk and fog of socialist talk rises the 
grimacing spectre of Marxism. 


To-day it is hard, and almost impossible, for me to say when the word 
‘Jew’ first began to have any particular significance for me. I do not remember 
ever having heard the word at home during my father’s lifetime. If this word 
had been used with a particular inflection I think the old gentleman would have 
considered those who used it in this way as being “behind the times.’ 


63 


In the course of his career he had, despite his pronounced nationalist 
tendencies, come to be more or less of a cosmopolitan, and this had not been 
without its effect on me. In school, too, I found no reason to alter the picture I 
had formed at home. 


At the Realschule I knew one Jewish boy. We were all on our guard in 
our relations with him, but only because his reticence and certain actions of his 
warned us to be discreet. Beyond that, my companions and myself formed no 
particular opinion regarding him. 


It was not until I was fourteen or fifteen years old that I frequently ran up 
against the word ‘Jew,’ partly in connection with political controversies. 
These references aroused a slight aversion in me, and I could not avoid an 
uncomfortable feeling which always came over me when I had to listen to 
religious disputes. But, at that time, I did not see the Jewish question in any 
other light. 


There were very few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries the Jews 
who lived there had become Europeanized and so civilised in appearance that 
I even looked upon them as Germans. The reason why I did not then perceive 
the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only thing which I recognised as 
distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. As I 
thought that they were persecuted on account of their faith my aversion to 
hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of horror. I did not in 
the least suspect that there could be such a thing as systematic anti-Semitism. 


Such were the views I held when I went to Vienna. 


Confused by the mass of impressions I received from the architectural 
surroundings, and depressed by my own troubles, I did not at first distinguish 
between the different social strata of which the population of that mammoth 
city was composed. 


Although Vienna then had about two hundred thousand Jews among its 
population of two millions, I did not notice them. 


During the first weeks of my sojourn, my eyes and my mind were unable 
to cope with the onrush of new ideas and values. 


Not until I had gradually settled down in my new surroundings, and the 
confused picture began to grow clearer, did I gain a closer insight into my new 
world, and with that I came up against the Jewish problem. 


64 


I will not say that the manner in which I first became acquainted with it 
was particularly pleasant. In the Jew I still saw a man who was of a different 
religion, and, therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I was against the idea 
that he should be attacked because he had a different faith. 


Consequently I considered that the tone adopted by the anti-Semitic press 
in Vienna was unworthy of the cultural traditions of a great people. The 
memory of certain events which happened in the Middle Ages came to my 
mind, and I felt that I should not like to see them repeated. 


Generally speaking, these anti-Semitic newspapers were not regarded as 
belonging to the first rank (but I did not then understand the reason of this) and 
so I regarded them as the products of jealousy and envy rather than as the 
expression of a sincere, though wrong-headed, feeling. 


My own opinions were confirmed by what I considered to be the 
infinitely more dignified manner in which the really important papers replied 
to these attacks or simply ignored them, which latter seemed to me the better 
way. 


I diligently read what was generally called the world press—Neue Freie 
Presse, Wiener Tageblatt, etc —and I was astonished by the abundance of 
information these gave their readers and the impartial way in which they 
presented particular problems. 


I appreciated their dignified tone, although sometimes the flamboyancy 
of the style was unconvincing, and I did not like it. All this, however, might be 
attributed to the atmosphere of the metropolis. 


Since, at that time, I considered Vienna to be such, I thought this 
constituted sufficient grounds to excuse these shortcomings of the press, but I 
was frequently disgusted by the grovelling way in which the Viennese press 
played lackey to the Court. Scarcely a move took place at the Hofburg which 
was not presented in glorified colours to the readers. There was such a fuss, 
especially when it was a question of ‘the wisest monarch of all times,’ that one 
was reminded of the antics of the mountain-cock at mating time. It all seemed 
artificial, and to my mind, unworthy of liberal democracy. 


I thought that this cheap way of currying favour at the Court belittled the 
dignity of the nation, and that was the first shadow that fell on my appreciation 
of the great Viennese press. 


65 


While in Vienna I continued to follow with a vivid interest all the events 
that were taking place in Germany, whether connected with political or with 
cultural questions. I had a feeling of pride and admiration when I compared the 
rise of the young German Reich with the decline of the Austrian State. 


But, although the foreign policy of that Reich was a source of real 
pleasure on the whole, the internal political happenings were not always so 
satisfactory. I did not approve of the campaign which, at that time, was being 
carried on against Wilhelm II. 


I looked upon him not only as the German Emperor but, above all, as the 
creator of the German Navy. The fact that the Emperor was prohibited by the 
Reichstag from making political speeches, made me very angry, because the 
prohibition came from a quarter which, in my eyes, had no reason for doing so, 
for at a single sitting those same parliamentary ganders did more cackling than 
the whole dynasty of emperors, including even the weakest, could have done in 
the course of centuries. 


It annoyed me to have to acknowledge that in a nation where any half- 
witted fellow could claim for himself the right to criticise and might even be 
let loose on the people as a ‘legislator’ in the Reichstag, the wearer of the 
Imperial Crown could be the subject of a ‘reprimand’ on the part of the most 
miserable assembly of drivellers that had ever existed. 


I was even more disgusted at the way in which this same Viennese press 
salaamed obsequiously before the meanest steed belonging to the Habsburg 
royal stables and went off into wild ecstasies of delight if the nag wagged its 
tail in response. 


At the same time these newspapers took up an attitude of anxiety in 
matters that concerned the German Emperor, trying to cloak their enmity by the 
serious air of concern which they assumed. Naturally, they protested that they 
had no intention of interfering in Germany’s internal affairs—God forbid! 


They pretended that by touching a delicate spot in such a friendly way 
they were fulfilling a duty that devolved upon them by reason of the mutual 
alliance between the two countries and at the same time discharging their 
obligations of journalistic truthfulness. 


Having thus excused themselves about tenderly touching a sore spot, they 
probed the wound ruthlessly. 


66 


That sort of thing made my blood boil, and now I began to be more and 
more on my guard when reading the great Viennese press. 


I had to acknowledge however, that on such subjects, one of the anti- 
Semitic papers—Deutsches Volksblatt—acted with more dignity. What got 
still more on my nerves was the repugnant manner in which the big newspapers 
cultivated admiration for France. 


One really had to feel ashamed of being a German when confronted by 
those mellifluous hymns of praise for ‘the great cultured nation.’ This wretched 
Gallomania more often than once made me throw away one of these 
newspapers belonging to the ‘world press.’ 


I now often turned to the Volksblatt, which was much smaller in size, but 
which treated such subjects more decently I was not in accord with its sharply 
anti-Semitic tone, but again and again I found that its arguments gave me food 
for serious thought. 


Anyhow it was as a result of such reading that I came to know the man 
and the movement which then determined the fate of Vienna. These were Dr. 
Karl Lueger and the Christian Socialist Party. At the time I went to Vienna I felt 
opposed to both. I looked on both the man and the movement as reactionary. 


But even an elementary sense of justice forced me to change my opinion 
when I had an opportunity of knowing the man and his work; and slowly that 
opinion grew into outspoken admiration when I had better grounds for forming 
a judgment. To-day, as well as then, I respect Dr. Karl Lueger as the most 
eminent type of German Burgomaster. 


How many prejudices were overcome through such a change in my 
attitude towards the Christian Socialist Movement! 


My ideas about anti-Semitism changed also in the course of time, but that 
was the change which I found most difficult. It cost me a great internal conflict 
with myself, and it was only after months of struggle between reason and 
sentiment that the former gained the victory. 


Two years later sentiment rallied to the side of reason and became a 
faithful guardian and counsellor. At the time of this bitter inner struggle 
between calm reason and the sentiments in which I had been brought up, the 
lessons that I learned on the streets of Vienna were of invaluable assistance. 


67 


A time came when I no longer passed blindly along the streets of the 
mighty city, as I had done in the early days, but now with my eyes open, not 
only in order to study the buildings, but also the human beings. 


Once, when passing through the oldest part of the city, I suddenly 
encountered a creature in a long caftan and wearing black sidelocks. My first 
thought was, is this, then, a Jew? 


They certainly did not have this appearance in Linz. I watched the man 
stealthily and cautiously, but the longer I gazed at that strange countenance and 
examined it feature by feature, the more the question shaped itself in my brain, 
‘Is this, then, a German?’ 


As was always my habit with such experiences, I turned to books for 
help in removing my doubts. For the first time in my life I bought myself some 
anti-Semitic pamphlets, for a few pence, but unfortunately they all began with 
the assumption that the reader had at least a certain degree of information on 
the Jewish question or was even familiar with it. 


Moreover, the tone of most of these pamphlets was such that I became 
doubtful again, because the statements made were partly superficial and the 
proofs extraordinarily unconvincing. For weeks, and indeed for months, I 
returned to my old way of thinking. 


The subject appeared so enormous and the accusations were so far- 
reaching that I was afraid of being unjust and so I became again anxious and 
uncertain. 


Naturally, I could no longer doubt that here it was not a question of 
Germans who happened to be of a different religion, but rather that it was a 
question of an entirely different people, for as soon as I began to investigate 
the matter and observe the Jews, Vienna appeared to me in a different light. 


Wherever I now went, I saw Jews, and the more I saw of them the more 
strikingly and clearly they stood out as different from the other citizens. 
Especially the old part of the city and the district north of the Danube Canal 
swarmed with a people who, even in outer appearance bore no similarity to 
the Germans. 


Any indecision which I may still have felt about that point was finally 
removed by the activities of a certain section of the Jews themselves. 


68 


A great movement, called Zionism, the aim of which was to assert the 
national character of Judaism, was strongly represented in Vienna. 


To all outward appearances it seemed as if only one group of Jews 
championed this movement, while the great majority disapproved of it, or even 
repudiated it, but a closer investigation of the situation showed that since that 
part of Jewry which was styled ‘liberal’ did not disown the Zionists as if they 
were not member of their race, but rather as brother Jews who publicly 
professed their faith in an unpractical, and even, dangerous way, there was no 
real rift in their internal solidarity. 


This fictitious conflict between the Zionists and the ‘liberal’ Jews soon 
disgusted me; for it was false through and through and therefore in direct 
contradiction to the moral dignity and immaculate character on which that race 
had always prided itself. 


Cleanliness, whether moral or of another kind, had its own peculiar 
meaning for these people. That they were water-shy was obvious on looking at 
them and, unfortunately, very often even when not looking at them. The odour 
of those people in caftans often used to make me feel ill. Apart from that there 
were the unkempt clothes and the ignoble exterior. All these details were 
certainly not attractive, but the revolting feature was that beneath their unclean 
exterior one suddenly perceived the moral mildew of the chosen race. 


What soon gave me food for serious thought was the insight which I 
gradually gained into the activities of the Jews in certain walks of life. 


Was there any shady undertaking, any form of, foulness, especially in 
cultural life, in which at least one Jew did not participate? 


On probing to the heart of this kind of abomination, one discovered, like 
a maggot in a rotten body, a tiny Jew, who was apt to be blinded when thus 
exposed to the light of day. 


In my eyes the charge against Judaism became a grave one the moment I 
discovered the scope of Jewish activities in the press, in art, in literature and 
in the theatre. 


All unctuous protests were now more or less futile. One needed only to 
look at the posters and to study the names of the authors of the appalling 
productions advertised as being performed in the cinemas and theatres, in 
order to become hardened against the Jews. 


69 


Here was a pestilence, a moral pestilence, with which the public was 
being infected. It was worse than the black plague of long ago. And in what 
doses this poison was manufactured and distributed! 


Naturally, the lower the moral and intellectual level of such an author of 
‘artistic’ products, the more inexhaustible his fecundity, and at times it even 
seemed as though these creatures turned out their stuff like machines and hurled 
it at the public. In this connection we must remember there is no limit to the 
number of such writers. 


One ought to realise that for one Goethe, Nature may bring into existence 
ten thousand such scribblers who act as the worst kind of germ-carriers in 
poisoning human soul. It was a terrible thought, and yet one which could not be 
overlooked, that the greater number of the Jews seemed specially destined by 
Nature to play this shameful part. 


Was it for this reason that they were called the chosen people? I then 
began to investigate carefully the names of all the fabricators of these unclean 
products which played such a big part in the cultural life of the public. The 
result of that investigation was still more unfavourable to the attitude which I 
had hitherto held in regard to the Jews. 


Though my feelings might rebel a thousand times, reason now had to 
draw its own conclusions. 


The fact that nine-tenths of all the ‘smutty’ literature, artistic ‘tripe’ and 
theatrical banalities, had to be charged to the account of a people who formed 
scarcely one percent of the nation could not be gainsaid. It was there and had 
to be admitted. 


Then I began to examine my favourite ‘world press,’ with that fact before 
my mind. 


The deeper I probed, the more did the object of my former admiration 
lose its glory. Its style became still more repellent and I was forced to reject 
its subject-matter as entirely shallow and superficial. Its impartial attitude in 
the presentation of facts and views seemed to me to contain more falsehood 
than truth. The writers were—Jews. 


Thousands of details that I had scarcely noticed before seemed to me 
now to deserve attention. I began to grasp and understand things which had 
formerly puzzled me. I saw the liberal policy of that press in another light. Its 


70 


dignified tone in replying to the attacks of its adversaries and its dead silence 
in other cases now became clear to me as part of a cunning and despicable 
way of deceiving the readers. 


Its brilliant theatrical criticisms always praised the Jewish authors and 
its adverse criticism was reserved exclusively for the Germans. 


The slight pin-pricks against Wilhelm II showed the persistency of its 
policy, just as did its systematic commendation of French culture and 
civilisation. The subject-matter of the serial was trivial and often indecent. 
The language of this press as a whole had the accent of a foreign people. The 
general tone was so openly derogatory to the Germans that this must have been 
definitely intentional. 


To whose interest was this? Or was it mere chance? In attempting to find 
an answer to these questions I gradually became more and more dubious. 


The process was hastened by glimpses which I gained of another aspect 
of the case, namely, the general conception of manners and morals which was 
openly upheld and put into practice by a large section of the Jews. Here again 
the life which I observed in the streets taught me by living example. 


The part which the Jews played in the evil of prostitution, and more 
especially in the white slave traffic, could be studied here better than in any 
other Western European city, with the possible exception of certain ports in 
Southern France. 


Walking by night along the streets of the Leopoldstadt, almost at every 
turn, whether one wished it or not, one witnessed certain incidents of which the 
majority of Germans knew nothing until the War made it possible, and indeed 
inevitable, for the soldiers to see such things on the Eastern front. 


A cold shiver ran down my spine when I first ascertained that it was the 
cold-blooded and shameless Jew who showed his consummate skill in 
conducting a sordid and vicarious trade among the dregs of the big city. Then I 
was filled with wrath. 


I had now no more hesitation about investigating the Jewish problem in 
all its details. Henceforth, I was determined to do so, but as I learned to track 
down the Jew in all the different spheres of cultural and artistic life, and in the 
various manifestations of this life everywhere, I suddenly came upon him 
where I had least expected to find him. 


71 


I now realised that the Jews were the leaders of Social Democracy. In 
the face of that revelation the scales fell from my eyes. My long inner struggle 
was at an end. 


In my relations with my fellow-workmen I was often astonished to find 
how easily and how often they changed their opinions on the same question, 
sometimes within a few days and sometimes even within the course of a few 
hours. 


I found it difficult to understand how men, who always had reasonable 
ideas when I spoke to them as individuals, suddenly lost this reasonableness 
the moment they came under the influence of the mass. I was often on the verge 
of despair. 


When, after talking to them for hours, I was convinced that I had, at last 
broken the ice or made them see the error of their way of thinking, and was 
sincerely pleased, I would often find to my disgust that next day I had to begin 
all over again. All my efforts had been in vain. With pendulum-like regularity 
they swung back to their original opinions. 


I was able to understand their position fully. They were dissatisfied with 
their lot and cursed the fate which had hit them so hard. They hated their 
employers, whom they looked upon as the heartless agents of their cruel 
destiny. 


Often they used abusive language against the public officials, whom they 
accused of having no sympathy with the situation of the working people. They 
made public demonstrations against the cost of living and paraded through the 
streets in defence of their claims. 


At least all this could be explained in the light of reason, but what was 
impossible to understand was the boundless hatred they expressed against their 
own fellow-citizens, how they disparaged their own nation, mocked at its 
greatness, reviled its history and dragged the names of its most illustrious men 
in the gutter. 


This hostility towards their own kith and kin, their own native land and 
home was as irrational as it was incomprehensible. It was against Nature. 


One could cure that malady temporarily, but only for some days, or at 
most for some weeks, but on meeting those whom one believed to have been 
converted one found that they had reverted to their old way of thinking and 


eA 


were again the prey of perverse opinions. 


I gradually discovered that the Social Democratic press was mainly 
controlled by Jews, but I did not attach special importance to this 
circumstance, for the same was true of other newspapers. 


In this connection there was, however, one striking fact, namely, that 
there was not a single newspaper with which Jews were connected that could 
be spoken of as ‘national’ in the sense that I, with my education and 
convictions, used that word. 


Making an effort to overcome my natural reluctance, I tried to read 
articles published in the Marxist press. However, as my aversion increased 
tenfold, I set about learning something of the people who wrote and published 
this mischievous stuff—from the publisher downwards, all of them were Jews! 


I got hold of as many Social Democratic pamphlets as I could and looked 
up the names of the authors—Jews all! 


I noted the names of nearly all their leaders and most of them belonged to 
the chosen race, whether they were members of the Reichsrat (Imperial 
Council), trade-union secretaries, chairmen of various organisations or street 
agitators. 


Everywhere the same sinister picture presented itself. I shall never 
forget the list of names—Austerlitz, David, Adler, Ellenbogen, and others. 


One fact became quite evident to me, namely, that this alien race held in 
its hand the leadership of that Social Democratic Party with whose minor 
representatives I had been disputing for months past. I was happy at last to 
know for certain that the Jew was not a German. 


Thus I learnt to know thoroughly those who were leading our people 
astray. One year in Vienna had sufficed to convince me that no worker is so 
rooted in his preconceived notions that he will not surrender them in face of 
better and clearer arguments and explanations. 


Gradually I became an expert in the doctrine of the Marxists and used 
this knowledge as an instrument to drive home my own firm convictions. I was 
successful in nearly every case. 


The great masses can be rescued, but a lot of time and a great deal of 


73 


patience must be devoted to such work. A Jew, on the other hand, can never be 
rescued from his fixed notions. 


I was then simple enough to attempt to show them the absurdity of their 
teaching. Within my small circle I talked to them until my throat ached and my 
voice grew hoarse. I believed that I could finally convince them of the danger 
inherent in the Marxist nonsense. 


But I achieved the very opposite. It seemed to me that a growing insight 
into the disastrous effects of the Social Democratic doctrine in theory and in 
practice only served to strengthen their opposition. 


The more I debated with them the more familiar I became with their 
tactics in debate. At the outset they counted upon the stupidity of their 
opponents; but when they got so entangled that they could not find a way out, 
they played the trick of acting the innocent simpleton. 


Should they fail, in spite of their tricks of logic, they acted as if they 
could not understand the counter-arguments and feeling themselves cornered, 
hastily transferred the discussion to another field. They uttered truisms and 
platitudes; and, if you accepted these, took this acceptance as applying to other 
problems and matters differing essentially from the original theme. 


If you cornered them on this point they would escape again, and you 
could not force them to make any precise statement. 


Whenever one tried, to get a firm grip on any of these apostles, one’s 
hand grasped only a slimy jelly which slipped through the fingers, but 
coagulated again a moment afterwards. 


If your arguments were so telling that your adversary felt forced to give 
in on account of those listening and if you then thought that at last you had 
gained ground, a surprise was in store for you on the following day. 


The Jew would be utterly oblivious to what had happened the day 
before, and he would start once again by repeating his former absurdities, and 
if nothing had happened. 


Should you become indignant and remind him of yesterday’s defeat, he 
pretended astonishment and could not remember anything, except that on the 
previous day he had proved that his statements were correct. 


74 


Sometimes I was dumbfounded. I do not know what amazed me the more 
—their quickness in repartee or the artful way in which they dressed up their 
falsehoods. I gradually came to hate them. Yet all this had its good side, 
because the better I came to know the real leaders, or at least the propagators 
of Social Democracy, the more did my love for my own people increase 
accordingly. 


Considering the satanic skill which these evil counsellors displayed, 
who could blame their unfortunate victims? Indeed, I found it extremely 
difficult to prove a match for the dialectic perfidy of that race. 


How futile was it to try to win over such people, seeing that they 
distorted the truth, denied the very words they had just uttered and used them 
again a few moments afterwards to serve their own ends in argument! 


The better I came to know the Jew, the easier it was to excuse the 
workers. 


In my opinion the, most culpable were not to be found among the 
workers, but rather among those who did not think it worthwhile to take the 
trouble to sympathise with these, and in accordance with the iron law of justice 
to give to the hard-working son of the people what was his, while at the same 
time executing his seducer and corrupter. 


Moved by my own daily experiences, I now began to investigate more 
thoroughly the sources of the Marxist teaching itself. Its effects were well 
known to me in detail, one needed only a little imagination in order to be able 
to forecast the inevitable consequences. 


The only question now was, ‘Did the founders foresee the effects of their 
work in the form which it was eventually to assume, or were the founders 
themselves the victims of an error?’ 


To my mind both, alternatives were possible. 


If the second question had to be answered in the affirmative, then it was 
the duty of every thinking person to push his way into the forefront of this 
sinister movement with a view to preventing it from producing the worst 
possible results. 


But if it were the first question which had to be answered in the 
affirmative, then it must be admitted that the original authors of this evil which 


73 


has infected the nations were devils incarnate, for only the brain of a monster, 

and not that of a man, could plan an organisation whose activities must finally 
bring about the collapse of human civilisation and turn this world into a desert 
waste. 


Such being the case, the only alternative left was to fight, and in that fight 
to employ all the weapons which the human spirit, human intellect and human 
will could furnish, leaving it to Fate to decide in whose favour the balance 
should tilt. 


I began to gather information about the authors of this teaching, with a 
view to studying the principles of the movement. The fact that I attained my 
object sooner than I could have anticipated as due to the insight into the Jewish 
question which I had recently gained, slight though it was. 


This newly acquired knowledge alone enabled me to make a practical 
comparison between reality and the theoretical talk of the founders of Social 
Democracy, because I now understood the language of the Jew. 


I realised that the Jew uses language for the purpose of dissimulating his 
thoughts or at least veiling them, so that his real aim cannot be discovered in 
his words, but rather by reading between the lines. This was the moment at 
which my opinions underwent the greatest transformation which I had as yet 
experienced; from being a soft-hearted cosmopolitan I became ardently anti- 
Semitic. 

Only on one further occasion, and that for the last time: did I give way to 
oppressing thoughts which caused me some moments of profound anxiety. As I 
critically reviewed the activities of the Jewish people throughout long periods 
of history I became perplexed and asked myself whether, for inscrutable 
reasons beyond the comprehension of poor mortals such as ourselves, Destiny 
might not have irrevocably decreed that the final victory should go to this small 
people? 


May it not be that this people which lives only for the things of this earth 
has been promised the earth as a reward? 


Have we, from the objective point of view, a right to fight for self- 
preservation, or is this right subjective? 


Fate answered the question for me inasmuch as it led me to make a 
detached and exhaustive inquiry into the Marxist teaching and the activities of 


76 


the Jewish people in connection with it. The Jewish doctrine of Marxism 
repudiates the aristocratic principle of Nature and substitutes for the eternal 
right of might and strength, the dead weight of sheer numbers. Thus it denies 
the individual worth of the human personality, disputes the teaching that 
nationality and race are of primary significance, and by doing this deprives 
Man of the very foundations of his existence and civilisation. 


If the Marxist teaching were to be accepted as the foundation of the life 
of the universe, it would lead to the disappearance of all order that is 
conceivable to the human mind, and thus the adoption of such a law would 
provoke chaos in the structure of the greatest organism that we know, with the 
result that the inhabitants of this earthly planet would finally disappear. 


Should the Jew, with the aid of his Marxist creed, triumph over the 
peoples of this world, his crown will be the funeral, wreath of mankind, and 
this planet will once again follow its orbit through ether, devoid of human life, 
as it did millions of years ago. 


Nature, the eternal, takes merciless vengeance on those who defy her 
laws. Therefore, I believe to-day that my conduct is in accordance with the 
will of the Almighty Creator. In resisting the Jew I am defending the handiwork 
of the Lord.

CHAPTER Ii: VIENNA DAYS—GENERAL 
REFLECTIONS 


To-day, I am of the opinion that, generally speaking, a man should not 
publicly take part in politics before he has reached the age of thirty, though, of 
course, exceptions must be made in the case of those who are naturally gifted 
with extraordinary political ability. 


The reason is that, until they have attained this age, most men are 
engaged in acquiring a certain general philosophy through the medium of which 
they can examine the various political problems of their day and adopt a 
definite attitude towards each. 


Only after he has acquired a fundamental Weltanschauung and thereby 
gained stability in the judgment he forms on specific problems of the day, is a 
man, having now reached maturity, at least of mind, qualified to participate in 
the government of the community. 


If this is not so, lie runs the risk of discovering that he has to alter the 
attitude which he had hitherto adopted with regard to essential questions, or, 
despite his superior knowledge and insight, he may have to remain loyal to a 
point of view which his reason and convictions have now led him to reject. 


If he adopts the former line of action he will find himself in a difficult 
situation, because in giving up a position hitherto maintained he will appear 
inconsistent and will have no right to expect his followers to remain as loyal to 
him as leader as they were before. 


This change of attitude on the part of the leader means that his adherents 
are assailed by doubt and not infrequently by a sense of discomfiture as far as 
their former opponents are concerned. Although he himself no longer dreams of 
standing by his political pronouncements to the last—for no man will die in 
defence of what he does not believe—he makes increasing and shameless 
demands on his followers. 


Finally, he throws aside the last vestiges of true leadership and becomes 
a ‘politician.’ This means that he becomes one of those whose only consistency 
lies in their inconsistency, which is accompanied by overbearing insolence and 
oftentimes by an artful mendacity developed to a shamelessly high degree. 


81 


Should such a person, to the misfortune of all decent people, succeed in 
becoming a member of parliament, it will be clear from the outset that for him 
the essence of political activity consists in a heroic struggle to retain his hold 
on this sinecure as a source of livelihood for himself and his family. The more 
his wife and children are dependent on him, the more stubbornly will he fight 
to maintain for himself the representation of his parliamentary constituency. 


For that reason any other person who shows evidence of political ability 
is his personal enemy. In every new movement he will apprehend the possible 
beginning of his own downfall, and everyone who is a better man than he will 
appear to him in the light of a menace. I shall subsequently deal more fully 
with the problem to which this kind of parliamentary vermin gives rise. 


When a man has reached his thirtieth year he has still a great deal to 
learn, but henceforward what he learns will serve to fill up the framework of 
that fundamental Weltanschauung which he already possesses. 


What he learns anew will not imply the abandonment of principles 
already held, but rather a deeper knowledge of those principles, and thus his 
colleagues will never have the disconcerting feeling that he has misled them 
hitherto. 


On the contrary, their confidence is increased when they perceive that 
their leader’s qualities are steadily developing since his newly acquired 
knowledge serves to enrich the doctrines in which they themselves believe. In 
their eyes every such development is fresh proof of the correctness of the 
opinions which they had hitherto held. 


A leader who has to abandon his general Weltanschauung, because he 
recognises its foundation to be false, acts honourably only if he admits the 
wrongness of his views and is prepared to bear the consequences. In sucha 
case he ought to refrain from taking a public part in any further political 
activity. 


Having once gone astray in essential matters he may possibly go astray a 
second time, but anyhow he has no right whatsoever to expect or demand that 
his fellow-citizens should continue to give him their support. 


How little such an honourable line of conduct commends itself to our 
public leaders nowadays is proved by the general corruption prevalent among 
the rabble which at the present moment feels itself called upon to play the 


82 


politician. There is scarcely one among them who has been chosen for this 
task. 


If he adopts the second alternative, the result will be one which is not 
uncommon to-day. In the same degree in which the leader no longer believes in 
what he himself says, his defence of his cause will be superficial and without 
conviction but, on the other hand, he will stoop to the use of base weapons. 


Although in those days I used to give more time than most others to the 
consideration of political questions, yet I carefully refrained from taking a 
public part in politics. Only to a small circle did I speak of those things which 
agitated my mind or were the cause of my constant preoccupation. 


The habit of discussing matters within such a restricted group had many 
advantages in itself. Rather than learning to deliver speeches I learned to know 
the people and their often very primitive views and protests. At the same time I 
waste no opportunity of extending my own education and in those days no city 
in Germany could have offered me more possibilities for this than did Vienna. 


In the old Danubian Monarchy, political interests were more 
comprehensive and more broad-minded than in the Germany of that epoch, 
excepting certain parts of Prussia, Hamburg and the districts bordering on the 
North Sea. 


When I speak of Austria here, I mean that part of the great Habsburg 
Empire which, by reason of its German population, furnished not only the 
historic basis for the formation of this State, but whose population had for 
centuries been the sole source of its strength and had given that politically 
artificial structure its internal cultural life. 


As time went on the stability of the Austrian State and the guarantee of its 
continued existence depended more and more on the preservation of this germ- 
cell of the Habsburg Empire. Just as the hereditary imperial provinces 
constituted the heart of the Empire, and just as it was this heart that constantly 
sent the blood of life pulsating through the whole political and cultural system, 
so Vienna was its brain and its will. 


At that time Vienna presented an appearance which made one think of her 
as an enthroned queen whose authoritative sway united the conglomeration of 
heterogeneous nationalities that lived under the Habsburg sceptre. 


The radiant beauty of the capital made one forget the sad symptoms of 


83 


senile decay which the State as a whole betrayed. Though the Empire was 
internally rickety because of the violent conflict going on between the various 
nationalities, the outside world (and Germany in particular) saw only that 
lovely picture of the city. 


The illusion was all the greater because at that time Vienna seemed to 
have entered upon the last and most spectacular phase of her splendour. Under 
a Mayor who had the true stamp of genius, the venerable residential city of the 
rulers of the old Empire seemed to have renewed the glory of its youth. 


The last great German who sprang from the ranks of the people that had 
colonized the Ostmark was no ‘statesman,’ in the official sense. Dr. Lueger, 
however, in his role as Mayor of the Imperial Capital and Residential City, had 
achieved so much in almost every sphere of municipal activity, whether 
economic or cultural, that the heart of the whole Empire throbbed with 
renewed vigour and he thus proved himself a much greater statesman than the 
so-called ‘diplomats’ of that period. The fact that this political conglomeration 
of heterogeneous races called Austria, finally broke down, is no evidence 
whatsoever of political incapacity on the part of the German element in the old 
Ostmark. 


The collapse was the inevitable result of an impossible situation. Ten 
million people cannot permanently hold together a State of fifty millions, 
composed of different and conflicting nationalities, unless certain definite 
conditions are fulfilled before it is too late. 


The German- Austrian possessed vision. Accustomed to live ina great 
Empire, he had a keen sense of the obligations incumbent on him in such a 
situation. He was the only member of the Austrian State who looked beyond 
the borders of the narrow lands belonging to the Crown, to the frontiers of the 
Reich. 


Indeed when Destiny severed him from the common Fatherland he tried 
to master the tremendous task before him and to preserve for the German- 
Austrians that patrimony which, through innumerable struggles, their ancestors 
had originally wrested from the East. 


It must be remembered that the German-Austrians could not put their 
undivided strength into this effort, because the hearts and minds of the best 
among them were constantly turning back towards their kinsfolk in the 
Fatherland, so that their home claimed only part of their affection. 


84 


The mental horizon of the German-Austrian was comparatively broad. 
His commercial interests comprised almost every part of the heterogeneous 
Empire. The conduct of almost all important undertakings was in his hands. 
The leading engineers and officials were for the most part of German origin. 


The German played the foremost part in carrying on the foreign trade of 
the country, as far as that sphere of activity was not under Jewish control. He 
was the political cement that held the State together. 


His military duties carried him far beyond the narrow frontiers of his 
homeland. Though the recruit might join a German regiment, that regiment was 
as likely to be stationed in Herzegovina as in Vienna or Galicia. The officers 
in the Habsburg armies were still Germans and so was the majority in the 
higher branches of the civil service. 


Art and science were in German hands. Apart from the new artistic trash, 
which might easily have been produced by a Negro tribe, all genuine artistic 
inspiration came from the German section of the population. 


In music, architecture, sculpture and painting, Vienna was the source 
which supplied the entire Dual Monarchy, and that source never seemed to 
show signs of drying up. 


Finally, it was the German element that determined the conduct of 
foreign, policy, though a small number of Hungarians were also active in that 
field. All efforts to save the State were, however, doomed to end in failure, 
because the essential prerequisites were missing. There was only one possible 
way to controlling and holding in check the centrifugal forces of the different 
and differing nationalities in the Austrian State. Either it had a central 
government and was, at the same time, internally organised, or it would cease 
to exist. 


Now and again there were lucid intervals in the highest quarters, when 
this truth was recognised, but it was soon forgotten again, or else deliberately 
ignored, because of the difficulties to be overcome in putting it into practice. 
Every project which aimed at giving the Empire a more federal shape was 
bound to be ineffective because there was no central nucleus in the form of a 
predominating state. 


In this connection it must be remembered that internal-conditions in 
Austria were quite different from those which characterized the German Reich 


85 


as founded by Bismarck. 


Germany was faced with only one difficulty, which was that of 
transforming the purely political traditions, because throughout the whole of 
Bismarck’s Germany there was a common cultural basis. 


The German Reich contained only members of one and the same racial 
or national stock, with the exception of a few foreign minorities. 


Conditions in Austria were quite the reverse. With the exception of 
Hungary, none of the provinces possessed a political tradition of past 
greatness, or if they did, it was either obliterated or obscured by the passage of 
Time. 


Moreover, this was the epoch when the principle of nationality began to 
be in the ascendant, and that phenomenon awakened the national instincts in the 
various countries affiliated under the Habsburg sceptre. 


It was difficult to control the action of these newly awakened national 
forces, because, adjacent to the frontiers of the Dual Monarchy, new national 
States were springing up whose people were of the same or kindred racial 
stock as the respective nationalities that constituted the Habsburg Empire. 


These new States were able to exercise a greater power of attraction 
than the German element. 


Even Vienna could not hold her own indefinitely. When Budapest had 
developed into a great city, a rival had grown up whose mission was, not to 
help in holding together the various divergent parts of the Empire, but rather to 
strengthen one part. 


Within a short time Prague followed the example of Budapest, and later 
on came Lemberg, Laibach and others. The fact was that these places which 
had formerly been provincial cities, now became national capitals, and 
provided centres for a cultural life that was gradually becoming more and 
more independent. In this way national political instincts acquired a spiritual 
foundation and gained in depth. 


The time was bound to come when the particularist interests of those 
various countries would become stronger than common imperial interests. 


Once that stage was reached, Austria’s doom was sealed. The course of 


86 


this development had been clearly perceptible since the death of Joseph II. Its 
rapidity depended on a number of factors, some of which had their origin in the 
monarchy itself, while others resulted from the position which the Empire held 
in the world of foreign politics. 


It was impossible to make anything like a successful effort for the 
permanent consolidation of the Austrian State unless a ruthless and persistent 
policy of centralisation were put into force. Before all, by the adoption, as a 
matter of principle, of one language as the official language of the State, the 
purely formal unity of the latter should have been emphasised, and thus the 
administration would have had in its hand that technical instrument without 
which the State could not endure as a political unity. 


Only if this had been done, could the schools and other forms of 
education have been used to inculcate a feeling of common citizenship. 


Such an objective could not be reached within ten or twenty years, but 
the effort would have to be envisaged in terms of centuries, just as, in all 
problems of colonisation, steady perseverance is a far more important element 
than intensive effort for a short period of time. 


It goes without saying that in such circumstances the country must be 
governed and administered by strict adhesion to the principle of uniformity. 
For me, it was quite instructive to discover why this did not take place, or 
rather, why it had not been done. Those who were guilty of the omission must 
be held responsible for the break-up of the Habsburg Empire. 


More than any other State, the old Austria depended on a strong and 
capable government. The Habsburg Empire lacked ethnical uniformity, which 
constitutes the fundamental basis of a national State and will preserve the 
existence of such a State even though the ruling power be grossly inefficient. 


When a State is composed of a homogeneous population, the natural 
inertia of the latter and the powers of resistance derived from that inertia will 
preserve it from internal collapse during astonishingly long periods of 
misgovernment and maladministration. It may often seem as if the life had died 
out of such a body-politic; but a time comes when the apparent corpse rises up 
and, gives the rest of the world astonishing proof of its indestructible vitality. 


The situation is utterly different in a country where the population is not 
homogeneous, where there is no bond of common blood, but only the rule of 


87 


force. Should the ruling hand show signs of weakness in such a State, the result 
will not be to cause a kind of hibernation of the State, but rather to awaken the 
individualistic instincts of the various racial groups. These instincts do not 
make themselves felt as long as these groups are dominated by, a strong central 
will-to-govern. 


The danger which exists in these slumbering separatist instincts can be 
rendered more or less innocuous only through centuries of common education, 
common traditions and common interests. 


The younger such States are, the more does their existence depend on the 
ability and, strength of the central government. If their foundation is due only to 
the work of a strong personality or a leader who is man of genius, they will, in 
many cases, break up as soon the founder disappears; because, though great, he 
stood alone, but even after centuries the danger inherent in these separatist 
instincts I have spoken of, is not always completely overcome. 


They may be only dormant and may suddenly awaken when the central 
government shows weakness and the force of a common education as well as 
the dignity of a common tradition prove unable to withstand the vital energies 
of separatist nationalities forging ahead towards the shaping of their own 
individual existence. 


Failure to see the truth of all this constituted what may be called the 
tragic guilt of the Habsburg rulers. Only in the case of one Habsburg ruler, and 
that for the last time, did the hand of Destiny hold aloft the torch that threw 
light on the future of his country, but, thereafter the torch was then extinguished 
for ever. 


Joseph II, who ruled over the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, 
was filled with a growing anxiety when he realised the fact that his House had 
been pushed to an outlying frontier of the Reich and that the time would soon 
be at hand when it would be overturned and engulfed in the whirlpool caused 
by that Babel of nationalities, unless something was done at the eleventh hour 
to overcome the dire consequences resulting from the negligence of his 
ancestors. 


With superhuman energy this ‘Friend of Mankind’ made every possible 
effort to counteract the effects of the carelessness and thoughtlessness of his 
predecessors. Within one decade he strove to repair the damage that had been 
done throughout the centuries. 


88 


If Destiny had only granted him forty years for his labours, and if only 
two generations had carried on the work which he had begun, the miracle might 
have been performed. But when he died, broken in body and spirit after ten 
years of rulership, his work was buried with him in the grave and rests with 
him there in the Capucin Crypt, sleeping an eternal sleep, without hope of a 
reawakening. 


His successors had neither the ability nor the will-power necessary for 
the task they had to face. When the first signs of a new revolutionary epoch 
appeared in Europe, the infection gradually spread to Austria, and when the 
fire finally broke out it was fed and fanned not by discontent with the social or 
political conditions, but by forces that had their origin in the nationalist 
yearnings of the various groups. 


The European revolutionary movement of 1848 primarily took the form 
of a class-conflict in almost every other country, but in Austria it took the form 
of a new racial struggle. 


In so far as the German-Austrians there forgot the origins of the 
movement, or perhaps had failed to recognise them at the start and 
consequently took part in the revolutionary uprising, they sealed their own fate, 
for they thus helped to awaken the spirit of Western Democracy which, within 
a short while, shattered the foundations of their own existence. 


The setting up of a representative parliamentary body, without 
previously having decreed that there should be one, official language and 
without having firmly established the use of this language, was the first great 
blow to the predominance of the German element in the Dual Monarchy. 


From that moment, the State was also doomed to collapse sooner or 
later. What followed was nothing but the historical liquidation of an empire. To 
watch that process of progressive disintegration was a tragic and, at the same 
time, an instructive experience. 


The execution of history’s decree was carried out in thousands of ways. 
The fact that great numbers of people went about blindfolded amid the manifest 
signs of dissolution only proved that the gods had decreed the destruction of 
Austria. 


I do not wish to dwell on details because these would lie outside the 
scope of this book. I want to treat in detail only those events which are typical 


89 


among the causes that lead to the decline of nations and States and are, 
therefore, of importance to our present age. Moreover, they helped to furnish 
the basis of my own political outlook. 


Among the institutions which most clearly manifested unmistakable signs 
of decay, even to the weak-sighted Philistine, was that which, of all state 
institutions, ought to have been the most firmly established, namely, the 
parliament, or the Reichsrat, as it was called in Austria. 


The pattern for this corporate body was obviously that which existed in 
England, the land of classic democracy. The constitution of that beneficent 
institution was adopted, lock, stock, and barrel, and transferred, with as little 
alteration as possible, to Vienna. 


As the Austrian counterpart to the British two-chamber system, an upper 
and a lower Chamber were established in Vienna. The two ‘Houses’ 
themselves, considered as buildings, were somewhat different in appearance. 
When Barry built the palatial Houses of Parliament, on the shores of the 
Thames, he could look to the history of the British Empire for inspiration for 
his work. 


In that history he found sufficient material to fill and decorate the twelve 
hundred niches, brackets, and pillars of his magnificent edifice. His statues and 
paintings made of the House of Lords and the House of Commons temples 
dedicated to the glory of the nation. 


Here it was that Vienna encountered the first difficulty. When Hansen, the 
Danish architect, had completed the last gable of the marble palace in which 
the new body of representatives of the people was to be housed, he had to turn 
to the ancient classical world for subjects for his decorations. 


This theatrical shrine of ‘Western Democracy’ was adorned with the 
statues and portraits of Greek and Roman statesmen and philosophers. As if 
meant to serve as an ironic symbol, the horses of the quadrigae that surmount 
the two Houses are pulling away from one another towards the four corners of 
the globe. There could be no better symbol for the kind of activity then going 
on within the walls of that same building. 


The ‘nationalities’ were opposed to any kind of glorification of Austrian 
history in the decoration of this building, insisting that such would constitute an 
insult and a provocation. 


90 


Much the same happened in Germany, where it was not until the battles 
of the Great War were being waged that the inscription dedicating the 
Reichstag (which was built by Wallot) to the German people, was finally 
engraved. 


I was not yet twenty years of age when I first entered the fine building in 
the Franzensring to watch and listen during a session of the Lower Chamber. I 
was filled with conflicting feelings. I had always hated the parliament, but not 
as an institution in itself. On the contrary, as one who cherished ideals of 
political freedom, I could not even imagine any other form of government. 


In the light of my attitude towards the House of Habsburg I should then 
have considered it a crime against liberty and reason to think of any kind of 
dictatorship as a possible form of government. 


A certain admiration which I had for the British Parliament contributed 
towards the formation of this opinion. I became imbued with that feeling of 
admiration, almost without my being conscious of it, through so much reading 
of newspapers while I was yet quite young. 


I could not discard that admiration all in a moment. The dignified way in 
which the British House of Commons fulfilled its function impressed me 
greatly, thanks largely to the glowing terms in which the Austrian Press 
reported on its doings. 


I used to ask myself whether there could be any nobler form of self- 
government by the people. These considerations furnished the very motives of 
my hostility to the Austrian parliament. The, form in which parliamentary 
government was here represented seemed unworthy of its great prototype. 


The following considerations also influenced my attitude: The fate of the 
German element in the Austrian State depended on its position in the 
Reichsrat. Up to the time that universal suffrage by secret ballot was 
introduced, the German representatives had a majority in the parliament, 
though that majority was not a very substantial one. This situation gave cause 
for anxiety because the Social Democratic faction could not be relied upon 
when national questions were at stake. 


In matters that were of critical concern for the German element, the 
Social-Democrats always took up an anti-German stand, because they were 
afraid of losing their followers among the other national groups. Even at that 


91 


time the Social-Democratic party could no longer be considered as a German 
party. 


The introduction of universal suffrage put an end even to the purely 
numerical predominance of the German element. The way was now clear for 
the further ‘de-Germanisation’ of the Austrian State. 


The national instinct of self-preservation made it impossible for me to 
welcome a representative system in which the German element was not really 
represented as such, but was always betrayed. Yet all these, and many others, 
were defects which could not be attributed to the parliamentary system as such, 
but rather to the Austrian State in particular. 


I still believed that if the German majority could be restored in the 
representative body there would be no occasion to oppose such a system as 
long as the old Austrian State continued to exist. 


Such was my general attitude at the time when I first entered those sacred 
and contentious halls. For me they were sacred only because of the radiant 
beauty of that majestic edifice—a Greek miracle on German soil. But I soon 
became enraged by the hideous spectacle that met my eyes. 


Several hundred representatives were there to discuss a problem of great 
economic importance. The experience of that day was enough to supply me 
with food for thought for several weeks. 


The intellectual level of the debate was depressing. Sometimes the 
debaters did not make themselves intelligible at all. Several of those present 
did not speak German, but only their Slav vernaculars or even dialects. 


Thus I had the opportunity of hearing with my own ears what I had been 
hitherto acquainted with only through reading the newspapers—a turbulent 
mass of people, all gesticulating and bawling together, with a pathetic old man 
ringing his bell and making frantic efforts to call the House to a sense of its 
dignity, by friendly appeals, exhortations, and grave warnings. I could not 
refrain from laughing. 


Several weeks later I paid a second visit. This time the House presented 
an entirely different picture, so much so that one could hardly recognise it as 
the same place. 


The hall was practically empty. The very atmosphere was sleepy, only a 


92 


few members were in their places, yawning in each other’s faces. One was 
speaking. A deputy speaker was in the chair. When he looked round it was 
quite plain that he felt bored. 


Then I began to reflect seriously on the whole thing. I went to the 
parliament whenever I had any time to spare and watched the spectacle 
silently, but attentively. I listened to the debates, as far as they were 
intelligible, and I studied the more or less intelligent features of those ‘elect’ 
representatives of the various nationalities which composed that ill-fated State. 


Gradually I formed my own ideas about what I saw. A year of such quiet 
observation was sufficient to transform, or completely destroy, my former 
opinion as to the character of this parliamentary institution. 


I no longer opposed merely the perverted form which the principle of 
parliamentary representation had assumed in Austria. It had become 
impossible for me to accept the system in itself. 


Up to that time I had believed that the disastrous, deficiencies of the 
Austrian parliament were due to the lack of a German majority, but now I 
recognised that the institution itself was wrong in its very essence and 
character. 


A number of problems presented themselves to my mind. I studied more 
closely the democratic principle of ‘decision by majority vote,’ and I 
scrutinised no less carefully the intellectual and moral worth of the gentlemen 
who as ‘the chosen representatives of the nation’ were entrusted with the task 
of making this institution function. 


Thus it happened that at one and the same time I came to know the 
institution itself and those of whom it was composed, and it was thus that, 
within the course of a few years, I came to forma clear and vivid picture of the 
average type of that most highly worshipped phenomenon of our time—the 
parliamentarian. The picture of him which I then formed became deeply 
engraved on my mind and I have never altered it since, at least as far as 
essentials go. 


Once again these object-lessons taken from real life saved me from 
getting firmly entangled by a theory which at first sight seems so alluring to 
many people; though that theory itself is a symptom of human decadence. 


Democracy, as practised in Western Europe to-day, is the forerunner of 


93 


Marxism. In fact, the latter would not be conceivable without the former. 
Democracy is the breeding ground in which the bacilli of the Marxist world- 
pest can grow and spread. By the introduction of parliamentarianism, 
democracy produced an abortion of ‘filth and fire,’ the fire of which, however, 
seems to have died out. 


I am more than grateful to Fate that this problem came to my notice when 
I was still in Vienna, for if I had been in Germany at that time, I might easily 
have found only a superficial solution. If I had been in Berlin, when I first 
discovered what a ridiculous thing this institution was, which we called 
parliament, I might easily have gone to the other extreme and believed (as 
many people believed, and apparently not without good reason) that the 
salvation of the people and the Reich could be secured only by restrengthening 
the principle of imperial authority. 


Those who held this belief did not discern the tendencies of their time 
and were blind to the aspirations of the people. 


In Austria one could not be so easily misled. There it was impossible to 
fall from one error into another. If the parliament were worthless, the 
Habsburgs were worse, or at least not in the slightest degree better. The 
problem was not solved by rejecting the parliamentary system. 


Immediately the question arose: what then? To repudiate and abolish the 
Reichsrat would have resulted in leaving all power in the hands of the 
Habsburgs. For me especially, that idea was impossible. 


Since this problem was especially difficult in regard to Austria, I went 
into the whole question more thoroughly than I otherwise should have done at 
that early age. The aspect of the situation that first made the most striking 
impression on me and gave me grounds for serious reflection was the manifest 
lack of any individual responsibility in the representative body. 


Parliament passes some act or decree which may have the most 
devastating consequences, yet nobody bears the responsibility for it. 


Nobody can be called to account, for surely one cannot say that a 
Cabinet discharges its responsibility when it resigns after having brought about 
a catastrophe. 


Or can we say that the responsibility is fully discharged when a new 
coalition is formed or parliament dissolved? Can a fluctuating majority ever be 


94 


held responsible for anything? Can the principle of responsibility mean 
anything else than the responsibility of a definite person? 


Is it possible to call the leader of any government to account for any 
action, the preparations for and execution of which are the outcome of the 
wishes and inclination of a majority? Is it not considered right that, instead of 
developing constructive ideas and plans, the business of a statesman consists 
in the art of making a whole pack of blockheads understand his projects so that 
they will grant him their generous consent? 


Is it an indispensable quality in a statesman that he should possess a gift 
of persuasion commensurate with the statesman’s ability to plan a far-reaching 
policy and take important decisions? 


Does it really prove that a statesman is incompetent if he should fail to 
gain a majority of votes in support of a definite scheme in an assembly which 
is the haphazard result of a more or less honest election? 


Has there ever been a case where such an assembly has comprehended a 
great political scheme before that scheme was put into practice and its 
greatness openly demonstrated through its success? 


In this world is not the creative act of the genius always a protest against 
the inertia of the mass? What shall the statesman do if he does not succeed in 
coaxing the parliamentary multitude to give its consent to his policy? Shall he 
purchase that consent? 


Or, when confronted with the obstinate stupidity of his fellow-citizens, 
should he refrain from pushing forward with the measures which lie deems to 
be of vital necessity to the life of the nation? 


Should he resign or remain in power? In such circumstances does not a 
man of character find himself face to face with an insoluble contradiction 
between his own political insight on the one hand and, on the other, his sense 
of decency or, better still, of honesty? 


Where can we draw the line between duty to the public and the 
obligation under which personal honour places a man? Must not every genuine 
leader renounce the idea of degrading himself to the level of a political 
jobber? 


And, on the other hand, does not every jobber feel the itch to ‘play 


95 


politics,’ seeing that the final responsibility will never rest with him 
personally, but with an anonymous mass which can never be called to account 
for its actions? Must not our parliamentary principle of government by 
numerical majority necessarily had to the destruction of the principle of 
leadership? 


Does anybody honestly believe that human progress originates in the 
composite brain of the majority and not in the brain of the individual? Or, is it 
presumed that in the future, human civilisation will be able to dispense with 
this as a condition of its existence? 


Is not the creative brain of the individual more indispensable to-day than 
ever before? 


The parliamentary principle of vesting legislative power in the decision 
of the majority rejects the authority of the individual and puts in its place the 
strength of the majority in question. In doing so, it contradicts the aristocratic 
principle, which is a fundamental law of Nature, but of course, we must 
remember that the aristocratic principle need not be exemplified by the upper 
ten thousand to-day. 


The devastating influence of this modem and democratic parliamentary 
institution might not easily be recognised by those who read the Jewish press, 
unless the reader has learned how to think independently and to examine the 
facts for himself: 


This institution is primarily responsible for the inrush of second-rate 
people into the field of politics. Confronted with such a phenomenon, a man 
who is endowed with real qualities of leadership will be tempted to refrain 
from taking part in political life, because under these conditions the situation 
does not call for a man who has a capacity for constructive statesmanship, but 
rather for a man who 1s, capable of bargaining for the favour of the majority. 


All the more will this activity appeal to small minds and will attract 
them accordingly. The narrower the mental outlook, the more insignificant the 
ability and the more accurate the estimate such a political jobber has of his 
own inferiority, the more will he be inclined to appreciate a system which 
does not demand creative genius or even high-class talent, but rather that crafty 
kind of sagacity which makes an efficient town clerk, and even prefers this 
kind of petty craftiness to the political genius of a Pericles. 


96 


Such a mediocrity does not even have to worry about responsibility for 
what he does. He need not trouble on that account, since, from the beginning, 
he knows that whatever be the results of his ‘statesmanship’ his end is already 
written in the stars—he will one day have to clear out and make room for 
another who is of similar mental calibre. 


It is another sign of our decadence that the number of eminent statesmen 
grows as the standard by which the individual is judged becomes lower, and 
that standard will fall the more the individual politician has to depend upon 
parliamentary majorities. 


A man of real political ability will refuse to act the lackey to a bevy of 
footling tacklers, and they, in their turn, being the representatives of the 
majority—which means the dunder-headed multitude—hate nothing so much as 
a superior brain. 


It is always a consolation to such village councillors from Gotham to be 
led by a person whose intellectual stature is on a level with their own. 


Thus each one may have the opportunity to shine in debate among such 
compeers and, above all, each one feels that he may one day rise to the top. If 
Peter be boss to-day, then why not Paul to-morrow? 


This invention of democracy is very closely connected with a peculiar 
phenomenon which has recently spread to a pernicious extent, namely, the 
cowardice of a large section of our so-called political leaders. Whenever 
important decisions have to be made, they are always fortunate in being able to 
hide behind the so-called majority. 


In observing one of these political manipulators one notices how he 
wheedles the majority in order to get their sanction for whatever action he 
takes. He has to have accomplices in order to be able to shift responsibility to 
other shoulders whenever he finds it opportune to do so. 


That is the main reason why this kind of political activity is abhorrent to 
men of character and courage, while at the same time it attracts inferior types, 
for a person who ts not willing to accept responsibility for his own actions, but 
always seeks to be covered, roust be classed among the cowards aid the 
rascals. If the leaders of the nation are of such miserable stuff, the evil 
consequences will soon manifest themselves. 


Nobody will then have the courage to take a decisive step. They will 


97 


submit to abuse and defamation rather than pluck up courage to take a definite 
stand, and thus nobody is left who is willing to risk his life, if need be, in 
carrying out a ruthless decision. 


One truth which must always be borne in mind is that the majority can 
never replace the man. The majority represents not only ignorance but also 
cowardice, and just as a hundred blockheads do not equal one man of wisdom, 
so a hundred poltroons are incapable of taking any political line of action that 
requires moral strength and fortitude. 


The lighter the burden of responsibility on each individual leader, the 
greater will be the number of those who, in spite of their sorry mediocrity, will 
feel the call to place their immortal talents at the: disposal of the nation. They 
are so much on the tip-toe of expectation that they find it hard to wait their turn. 


They stand in a long queue, painfully and sadly counting the number of 
those ahead of them and calculating the hours until, they can eventually come 
forward. They are delighted every time the holder of the office on which they 
have set in their hearts, is changed and they are grateful for every scandal 
which removes one of the aspirants waiting ahead of them in the queue. 


If somebody sticks too long to his office stool they consider this almost a 
breach of a sacred understanding based on their mutual solidarity. They grow 
furious and do not rest until that inconsiderate person is finally driven out and 
forced to hand over his cosy berth. After that he will have little chance of 
getting another opportunity. 


Usually these placemen who have been forced to give up their posts push 
themselves again into the waiting queue unless they are hounded away by the 
protests of the other aspirants. 


The result of all this is that, in such a State, the quick succession of 
changes in public positions and public offices has a very unfavourable effect 
which may easily lead to disaster. 


It is not only the ignorant and the incompetent person who is the victim of 
these conditions, for the genuine leader is affected in an even greater degree, if 
Fate has actually succeeded in putting such a man into that position. 


Let the superior quality of such a leader be once recognised and the 
result will be that a joint front will be organised against him, particularly if 
that leader, though not coming from their ranks, dares to push his way into the 


98 


circles of the elect. 


They want to have only their own company and will quickly take up a 
hostile attitude towards any man who may show himself obviously above and 
beyond them. Their instinct, which 1s so blind in other directions, is very sharp 
in this particular. 


The inevitable result is that the intellectual level of the ruling class sinks 
steadily. One can easily forecast how much the nation and the State are bound 
to suffer from such a state of affairs, provided one does not belong to that same 
class of ‘leaders.’ 


The parliamentary regime in the old Austria was the very archetype of 
the institution as I have described it. Though the Austrian Premier was 
appointed by the King-Emperor, this act of appointment merely gave practical 
effect to the will of the parliament. 


The huckstering and bargaining that went on in regard to every 
ministerial position was typical of Western Democracy. The results that 
followed were in keeping with the principles applied. The intervals between 
the replacement of one person by another gradually became shorter, finally 
ending up ina wild relay race. With each change the quality of the statesman in 
question deteriorated, until finally only the petty type of parliamentarian 
remained. 


In such people the qualities of statesmanship were measured and valued 
according to the adroitness with which they pieced together one coalition after 
another, in other words, to their craftiness 1s manipulating the pettiest political 
transactions, which is the only kind of practical activity by means of which 
these men can prove themselves to be suitable representative of the people. In 
this sphere Vienna was the school which offered the most impressive 
examples. 


Another feature that engaged my attention quite as much was the contrast 
between the talents and knowledge of these representatives of the people, on 
the one hand, and, on the other, the nature of the tasks they had to face. 


Willy-nilly one could not help thinking seriously of the narrow 
intellectual outlook of these chosen representatives of the various constituent 
nationalities, and one could not avoid pondering on the methods by which these 
noble figures in our public life were first discovered. 


99 


It was worth while to make a thorough study and examination of the way 
in which the real talents of these gentlemen were devoted to the service of their 
country; in other words, to analyse thoroughly the routine of their activities. 


The whole spectacle of parliamentary life became more and more 
desolate the more one penetrated into its intimate structure and studied the 
persons and principles of the system in a spirit of ruthless objectivity. 


Indeed it is very necessary to be strictly objective in the study of the 
institution whose sponsors talk of ‘objectivity’ in every other sentence, as the 
only fair basis of examination and judgment. If one studied these gentlemen and 
the laws governing their strenuous existence, the results were surprising. 


There is no other principle which turns out to be quite so ill-conceived 
as the parliamentary principle, if we examine it objectively. 


In our examination of it we may pass over the methods according to 
which the election of the representatives takes place, as well as the wiles 
which bring them into office and bestow new titles on them. It is quite evident 
that only to a tiny degree are public wishes or public needs satisfied by the 
manner in which an election takes place, for everybody who properly 
estimates the political intelligence of the masses, can easily see that this is not 
sufficiently developed to enable them to form general political judgments on 
their own account, or to select the men who might be competent to carry out 
their ideas in practice. 


Whatever definition we may give of the term “public opinion,’ only a 
very, small part of it originates in personal experience or individual insight. 
The greater portion of it results from the manner in which public matters have 
been presented to the people through an overwhelmingly impressive and 
persistent system of ‘enlightenment.’ 


In the religious sphere the profession of a denominational belief is 
largely the result of education, while the religious yearning itself slumbers in 
the soul; so, too, the political opinions of the masses are the final result of 
influences systematically operating on human sentiment and intelligence in 
virtue of a method which is applied sometimes with almost incredible 
thoroughness and perseverance. 


By far the most effective part in political education, which, in this 
connection, is best expressed by the word ‘propaganda,’ is that played by the 


100 


press. 


The press is the chief means employed in the process of political 
‘enlightenment’. It represents a kind of school for adults. This educational 
activity, however, is not in the hands of the State, but in the clutches of powers 
which are partly of a very inferior character. 


While still a young man in Vienna, I had excellent opportunities for 
getting to know the men who owned this machine for mass instruction, as well 
as those who supplied it with the ideas it propagated. At first I was quite 
surprised when I realised how little time was necessary for this dangerous 
‘Great Power’ within the State to produce a certain belief among the public— 
even when the genuine will and convictions of the public were completely 
misconstrued. 


It took the press only, a few days to transform some ridiculously trivial 
matter into an issue of national importance, while vital problems were 
completely ignored or shelved and hidden away from public attention. 


The press succeeded in the magic art of producing names from nowhere 
within the course of a few weeks. It made it appear that the great hopes of the 
masses were bound up with those names, and made their bearers more popular 
than many a man of real ability could ever hope to be in a long lifetime; at the 
same time old and tried figures in the political and other spheres of public life 
quickly faded from the public memory and were forgotten as if dead, though 
still in the full enjoyment of their health. 


Yet these were names which only a month before, had been unknown and 
unheard-of. Sometimes such men were so vilely abused that it looked as if 
their names would soon stand as permanent symbols of the worst kind of 
baseness. 


In order to estimate properly the really pernicious influence which the 
press can exercise one has only to study this infamous Jewish method whereby 
honourable and decent people are besmirched with mud and filth, in the form 
of low abuse and slander, from hundreds of quarters simultaneously, as if in 
response to some magic formula. 


These intellectual pickpockets would grab at anything which might serve 
their evil ends. They would poke their noses into the most intimate family 
affairs and would not rest until they had sniffed out some petty item which 


101 


could be used to destroy the reputation of their unfortunate victim. 


But if the result of all this nosing should be that nothing derogatory was 
discovered in the private or public, life of the victim, they resorted to slander, 
in the belief that some of their animadversions would stick, even though refuted 
a thousand times. 


In most cases it finally turned out impossible for the victim to continue 
his defence, because the accuser worked together with so many accomplices 
that his slanders were re-echoed interminably. 


But these slanderers would never own that they were acting from 
motives which influence the common run of humanity or are comprehensible in 
them. Oh, no! The scoundrel who defamed his contemporaries in this 
villainous way would crown himself with a halo of heroic probity fashioned of 
unctuous phraseology and twaddle about his ‘duties as a journalist’ and other 
lying nonsense of that kind. 


When these slanderers gathered together in large numbers at meetings 
and congresses they would utter a lot of slimy talk about a special kind of 
honour which they called the ‘professional honour of the journalist.’ 


Then the assembled species would bow their respects to one another. 
This is the kind of being that fabricates more than two-thirds of what is called 
public opinion, from the foam of which the parliamentary Aphrodite eventually 
arises. 


Several volumes would be needed if one were to give an adequate 
account of the whole procedure and fully describe all its hollow fallacies, but 
if we pass over the details, and look at the product itself and its activities, I 
think this alone will be sufficient to open the eyes of even the most innocent 
and, credulous person; so that he may recognise the absurdity of this institution 
by looking at it objectively. 


In order to realise how this form of human aberration is as harmful as it 
is absurd, the best and easiest method is to compare democratic 
parliamentarianism with a genuine Germanic Democracy. 


The remarkable characteristic of the parliamentary form of democracy is 
the fact that a number of persons, let us say five hundred including, in recent 
times, women also are elected to parliament and invested with authority to 
give final judgment on anything and everything. 


102 


In practice, they alone are the governing body; for, although they may 
appoint a Cabinet, which seems outwardly to direct the affairs of state, this 
Cabinet is only a sham. In reality the so-called government cannot do anything 
against the consent of the assembly. It can never be called to account for 
anything, since the right of decision 1s not vested in the Cabinet, but in the 
parliamentary majority. 


The Cabinet always functions only as the executor of the will of the 
majority. Its political ability, can be judged only according to how far it 
succeeds in adjusting itself to the will of the majority or in persuading the 
majority to agree to its proposals, but this means that it must descend from the 
level of a real governing power to that of a mendicant who has to beg the 
favour of the majority. 


Indeed the chief preoccupation of the Cabinet must be to secure for itself, 
in the case of each individual measure, the favour of the majority, or to 
establish a new one that will be more favourably disposed. If it should succeed 
in either of these efforts, it may go on ‘governing’ for a little while, if it should 
fail, 1t must reign. 


The question whether its policy as such has been right or wrong does not 
matter at all. All responsibility is thereby practically abolished. To what 
consequences such a state of affairs can lead may be easily understood from 
the following simple observations. 


Those five hundred deputies who have been elected by the people have 
followed various callings and show very varying degrees of political capacity, 
with the result that the whole combination is disjointed and sometimes presents 
quite a sorry picture. Surely nobody believes that these chosen representatives 
of the nation are the choice spirits or first class intellects. 


Nobody, I hope, is foolish enough to pretend that hundreds of statesmen 
can emerge from papers placed in the ballot-box by electors who are anything 
but intelligent. The absurd notion that men of genius are born out of universal 
suffrage cannot be too strongly repudiated. A nation produces a genuine 
statesman once in the space of many years, and never by the hundred. 


Secondly, among the broad masses there is an instinctive antipathy 
towards every outstanding genius. There is a better chance of seeing a camel 
pass through the needle’s eye than of seeing a really great man ‘discovered’ 
through an election. 


103 


Throughout the history of the world, those who have been above the 
average have generally come to the fore of their own accord, but here five 
hundred persons possessing but modest intellectual qualities pass judgment on 
the most important problems affecting the nation. 


They form governments, which, in turn, have to gain the consent of the 
illustrious assembly for every legislative step that may be taken, which means 
that the policy to be carried out is actually the policy of the five hundred, and 
generally speaking, this is obvious. 


Let us pass over the intellectual qualities of these representatives and 
ask what is the nature of the task before them. If we consider the fact that the 
problems which have to be discussed and solved belong to the most varied and 
diverse fields, we can very well realise how inefficient a governing system 
must be, which entrusts the right of decision to a mass assembly, in which only 
very few possess the knowledge and experience which would qualify them to 
deal with the matters that have to be settled. 


The most important economic measures are submitted to a tribunal in 
which not more than one-tenth of the members have studied the elements of 
economics. This means that final authority is vested in men who are utterly 
devoid of any preparatory training which would make them competent to 
decide on the questions at issue. 


The same holds true of every other problem. It is always a majority of 
ignorant and incompetent people who decide on each measure, for the 
composition of the institution does not vary, while the problems to be dealt 
with extend to the most varied spheres of public life and would actually 
require to be weighed and settled by a continually changing body of 
representatives. 


It is out of the question to think that the same people are fitted to decide 
on transport questions as well as, let us say, on questions of foreign policy, 
unless each of them be a universal genius, but scarcely more than one genius 
appears in the course of a century. 


Here, unfortunately, it is seldom a question of even average brains, but 
only of dilettanti who are as narrow-minded as they are conceited and 
arrogant, semi-educated persons of the worst kind. 


This is why these honourable gentlemen show such astonishing levity in 


104 


discussing and deciding matters that would demand the most painstaking 
consideration even from great minds. 


Measures of momentous importance for the future existence of the State 
are framed and discussed in an atmosphere more suited to the card-table. 
Indeed the latter suggests a much more fitting occupation for these gentlemen 
than that of deciding the destiny of a people. 


Of course it would be unfair to assume that each member in such a 
parliament originally possessed such a slight sense of responsibility. That is 
not so, but this system, by forcing the individual to pass judgment on questions 
which he is not competent to decide gradually debases his moral character. 
Nobody will have the courage to say, “Gentlemen, I am afraid we know 
nothing of what we are talking about. I, for one, admit this.” 


Anyhow, if such a declaration were made it would not change matters 
very much, for such outspoken honesty would not be understood and such an 
honourable fool ought not to be allowed to spoil the game. Those who have a 
knowledge of human nature know that nobody likes to be considered a fool by 
his associates, and in certain circles honesty is taken as an index of stupidity. 


Thus it happens that a naturally upright man, once he finds himself 
elected to parliament, may eventually be induced by force of circumstances, to 
acquiesce ina general line of conduct which is base in itself and amounts to a 
betrayal of the public trust. 


The feeling that, if the individual refrained from taking part in a certain 
decision, his attitude would not alter the situation in the least, destroys every 
real honest instinct which might occasionally prick the conscience of one 
person or another. 


Finally, the otherwise upright deputy will succeed in persuading himself 
that he is by no means the worst of the lot and that, by taking part in a certain 
line of action, he may prevent something worse from happening. 


A counter-argument may be put forward here. It may be said that of 
course the individual member may not have the knowledge which 1s requisite 
for the treatment of this or that question, yet his attitude towards it is taken on 
the advice of his party as the guiding authority in each political matter; and it 
may further be said that the party sets up special committees of experts who 
have even more than the requisite knowledge for dealing with the questions 


105 


placed before them. 


At first sight, that argument seems sound. But then another question 
arises, namely, why are five hundred persons elected, if only a few have the 
wisdom which is required to deal with the more important problems? That is 
just the point. 


It is not the aim of our modern democratic parliamentary system to bring 
together an assembly of intelligent and well-informed deputies. Not at all. The 
aim is rather to bring together a group of nonentities who are dependent on 
others for their point of view and who can be the more easily led, the narrower 
their individual mental outlook. 


That is the only way in which a party policy, according to the evil 
meaning it has to-day, can be put into effect, and by this method alone is it 
possible for the wire-puller, who exercises the real control, to remain in the 
dark, so that he personally can never be brought to account for his actions. 


For, in such circumstances none of the decisions taken, no matter how 
disastrous they may turn out for the nation as a whole, can be laid at the door of 
the individual whom everybody knows to be the evil genius responsible for the 
whole affair, all responsibility is shifted to the shoulders of the faction (party 
caucus). 


In practice, no actual responsibility remains, for responsibility arises 
only from personal duty and not from the obligations that rest with a 
parliamentary assembly of empty talkers. 


The parliamentary institution attracts people of the badger type, who 
shun the light. Any upright man, who is ready to accept personal responsibility 
for his actions, will despise such an institution. 


That is the reason why this brand of democracy has become a tool in the 
hands of that race which, because of its secret aims, must shun the light, as it 
always has done and always will do. Only a Jew can praise an institution 
which is as corrupt and as false as himself. 


As a contrast to this kind of democracy we have the Germanic 
democracy, which is a true democracy, for here the leader is freely chosen and 
is obliged to accept full responsibility for all his actions and omissions. 


The problems to be dealt with are not put to the vote of the majority, but 


106 


are decided by the individual and as a guarantee of the sincerity of his 
decisions, he pledges all he has in the world and even his life. 


The objection may be raised here, that under such conditions, it would 
be very difficult to find a man who would be ready to devote himself to so 
fateful a task. 


The answer to that objection is as follows: We thank God that the inner 
spirit of our German democracy will of itself prevent the chance careerist, 
who may be intellectually worthless and a moral twister, from coming by 
devious ways to a position in which he may govern his fellow-citizens. 


The fear of assuming such far-reaching responsibilities, under Germanic 
democracy, will scare off the ignorant and the weak. Should it happen that such 
a person tried to creep in surreptitiously, it will be easy enough to identify him 
and apostrophize him ruthlessly, somewhat thus, “Be off, you scoundrel. Do not 
soil these steps with your feet; because these are the steps that lead to the 
portals of the Pantheon of History, and they are not meant for sneaks but for 
heroes.” 


Such were the views I formed after two years attendance at the sessions 
of the Viennese parliament. Then I ceased to go there. 


The parliamentary regime was one of the causes of the steady decline of 
the strength of the Habsburg State during the last years of its existence. The 
more the predominance of the German element was whittled away through 
parliamentary procedure, the more pronounced became the system of playing 
off one of the various constituent nationalities against the other. 


In the Reichsrat it was always the German element that suffered through 
the system, which meant that the results were detrimental to the Empire as a 
whole, for at the close of the century even the most simple-minded people 
could recognise that the cohesive forces within the Dual Monarchy no longer 
sufficed to counterbalance the separatist tendencies of the provincial 
nationalities. 


On the contrary, as the measures which the State was able to adopt for its 
own preservation became more and more ineffectual the general contempt for 
the State increased. Not only Hungary, but also the various Slav provinces, 
gradually ceased to identify themselves with the monarchy which embraced 
them all and, accordingly, they did not feel its weakness as in any way 


107 


detrimental to themselves. 


They rather welcomed these manifestations of senile decay. They looked 
forward to the final dissolution of the State, and not to its recovery. 


In the parliament the complete collapse was postponed by the 
humiliating concessions that were made to every kind of importunate demand 
at the expense of the German element; while, throughout the country, 1t was 
staved off by playing off the various nationalities one against another. 


The general trend of this development was directed against the Germans. 
Especially since the right of succession to the throne had given the Archduke 
Franz Ferdinand a certain amount of influence, the policy of Czechisation was 
being carried out systematically. 


With all the means at his command the heir to the Dual Monarchy 
personally furthered the policy that aimed at eliminating the influence of the 
German element, or at least he approved of that policy. By making use of State 
officials, purely German districts were gradually but definitely brought within 
the danger zone of the mixed languages. 


Even in Lower Austria this process began to make headway with 
constantly increasing speed, and Vienna was looked upon by many Czechs as 
their largest city. 


In the family circle of this new Habsburger the Czech language was 
favoured. The wife of the Archduke had formerly been a Czech countess and 
was wedded to the Prince by a morganatic marriage. She came from an 
environment where hostility to the Germans had been traditional. 


The leading idea in the mind of the Archduke was to establish in Central 
Europe a Slav State which was to be constructed on a purely Catholic basis, as 
a bulwark against Orthodox Russia. 


As had happened often in Habsburg history, religion was thus exploited 
to serve a purely political policy, and in this case a fatal policy, at least, as far 
as German interests were concerned. The result was lamentable in many 
respects. 


Neither the House of Habsburg nor the Catholic Church received the 
reward which they had expected. Habsburg lost the throne and the Church lost 
a great State. By employing religious motives in the service of politics, a spirit 


108 


was aroused of which the instigators of that policy had never dreamed. 


The reply to the attempt to exterminate Germanism in the old Monarchy 
by every available means was the Pan-German Movement in Austria. 


In the eighties of the last century, Manchester-Liberalism, which was 
Jewish in its fundamental ideas, had reached the zenith of its influence 1n the 
Dual Monarchy, or had already passed that point. 


The reaction which set-in, did not arise from social, but from nationalist, 
tendencies, as was always the case in the old Austria. The instinct of self- 
preservation drove the German element to defend itself energetically. 


Economic considerations only slowly began to play an important part; 
but they were of secondary concern. Out of the general political chaos two 
party organisations emerged. 


The one was more of a national, and the other more of a social, 
character, but both were highly interesting and instructive for the future. 


After the war of 1866, which had resulted in the defeat of Austria, the 
House of Habsburg contemplated having its revenge on the battlefield. Only the 
tragic end of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico prevented still closer 
collaboration with France. 


The chief blame for Maximilian’s disastrous expedition was attributed to 
Napoleon III and the fact that the Frenchman left him in the lurch aroused a 
general feeling of indignation. Yet the Habsburgs were still lying in wait for 
their opportunity. If the war of 1870-71 had not been such a singular triumph, 
the Viennese Court might have risked bloodshed in order to have its revenge 
for Sadowa. 


But when there arrived from the Franco-German battlefield the first 
reports which, though true, seemed miraculous and almost incredible, the ‘most 
wise’ of all monarchs recognised that the moment was inopportune and tried to 
accept the unfavourable situation with as good a grace as possible. 


The heroic conflict of those two years (1870—71) produced a still 
greater miracle, for, with the Habsburg the change of attitude never came from 
an inner heartfelt urge, but only from the pressure of circumstances. 


The German people of the Ostmark, however, were entranced by the 


109 


triumphant glory of the newly established German Empire and were profoundly 
moved when they saw the dream of their fathers thus gloriously realised. 


Let us make no mistake, the true German-Austrian realised from this time 
onward, that Koniggratz was the tragic, though necessary, pre-condition for the 
re-establishment of a Reich which should no longer be burdened with the palsy 
of the old alliance and which indeed had no share in that morbid decay. 


Above all, the German-Austrian had come to feel in the very depths of 
his own being that the historical mission of the House of Habsburg had come to 
an end and that the new Reich must choose only an Emperor who was of heroic 
mould and was therefore worthy to wear the ‘Crown of the Rhine.’ Destiny 
should be praised for having chosen a scion of that House which, in a turbulent 
age, had given the nation a shining example for all time, in the shape of 
Frederick the Great. 


After the great war of 1870—71 the House of Habsburg set to work fully 
determined to exterminate slowly and deliberately (for that was bound to be 
the result of the Slavophile policy) the dangerous German element about whose 
inner feelings and attitude there could be no doubt. 


Then the fire of rebellion blazed up among the people whose 
extermination had been decreed—a fire such as had never been witnessed in 
modem German history. For the first time nationalists and patriots were 
transformed into rebels; not rebels against the nation or the State as such but 
rebels against a form of government which, they were convinced, would 
inevitably bring about the ruin of their own people. 


For the first time in modem history the traditional dynastic patriotism and 
national love of Fatherland and people were in open conflict. 


It was to the credit of the Pan-German movement in Austria during the 
closing decade of the last century that it pointed out clearly and unequivocally 
that a State is entitled to demand respect and protection for its authority, only 
when such authority is administered in accordance with the interests of the 
nation, or at least not in a manner detrimental to those interests. 


The authority of the State can never be an end in itself; for, if that were 
so, any kind of tyranny would be inviolable and sacred. If a government uses 
the instruments of power in its hands for the purpose of leading a people to 
ruin, then rebellion is not only the right, but also the duty, of every individual 


110 


citizen. 


The question of whether and when such a situation arises cannot be 
answered by theoretical dissertations, but only by sheer force and success. 


Every government, even though it may be the worst possible and even 
though it may have betrayed the nation’s trust in thousands of ways, will claim 
that its duty is to uphold the authority of the State. 


Its adversaries, who are fighting for national self-preservation, must use 
the same weapons which the government uses if they are to prevail against 
such a rule and secure their own freedom and independence. Therefore the 
conflict will be fought out with ‘legal’ means as long as the power which is to 
be overthrown uses them; but the insurgents will not hesitate to apply illegal 
means if the oppressor himself employs them. 


Generally speaking, we must not forget that the highest aim of human 
existence is not the preservation of a State or government but rather the 
preservation of the race. 


If the race is in danger of being oppressed or even exterminated, the 
question of legality is only of secondary importance. The established power 
may, in such a case, employ only those means which are recognised as ‘legal,’ 
yet the instinct of self-preservation on the part of the oppressed will always 
justify, to the highest degree, the employment of all available weapons. 


It is only through recognition of this principle that certain peoples of this 
earth have, in the course of history, been able to set such a magnificent example 
in their struggle against the foreign oppressor or tyranny at home. 


Human rights are above the right of the State. But if a people be defeated 
in the struggle for its human rights this means that its weight has proved too 
light in the scale of Destiny to be worthy of the good fortune to continue to 
exist on earth. 


For the doom of those who are neither prepared nor able to fight for their 
existence is sealed by an ever-just providence. The world is not for faint- 
hearted races. 


Austria affords a very clear and striking example of how easy it is for 
tyranny to hide its head under the cloak of what is called ‘legality.’ 


111 


The legal exercise of power in the Habsburg State was then based on the 
anti-German attitude of the parliament, with its non-German majorities, and on 
the dynastic House, which was also hostile to the German element. 


The whole authority of the State was incorporated in these two factors. 
To attempt to alter the lot of the German element through these two factors 
would have been senseless. Those who advocated the ‘legal’ way as the only 
possible way, and also obedience to the State authority, could offer no 
resistance; because a policy of resistance could not have been put into effect 
through legal measures. 


To follow the advice of the legalist counsellors would have meant the 
inevitable ruin of the German element within the Monarchy, and this disaster 
would not have been long in coming. The German element was actually saved 
only by the collapse of the State as such. 


The spectacled theorist would have given his life for his doctrine rather 
than for his people. Because man has made laws, he subsequently comes to 
think that he exists for the sake of those laws. A great service rendered by the 
Pan-German movement then was that it abolished all such nonsense, though the 
doctrinaire theorists and other fetish worshippers were shocked. 


When the Habsburgs attempted to come to close quarters with the 
German element, by the employment of all the means of attack which they had 
at their command, the Pan-German Party hit out ruthlessly against the 
‘illustrious’ dynasty. 


This party was the first to probe into and expose the corrupt condition of 
the State; and in so doing it opened the eyes of hundreds of thousands. To have 
liberated the high ideal of love for one’s country from the embrace of this 
deplorable dynasty was one of the great services rendered by the Pan-German 
movement. When that part first made its appearance it secured a large 
following. Indeed, the movement threatened to become almost an avalanche, 
but the first successes were not maintained. 


At the time I went to Vienna the Pan-German Party had been eclipsed by 
the Christian-Socialist Party, which had come into power in the meantime. 
Indeed, the Pan-German Party had sunk to a level of almost complete 
insignificance. 


The rise and decline of the Pan-German movement, on the one hand, and 


LT 


the marvellous progress of the Christian-Socialist Party, on the other, became 
for me an object of study and as such they played an important part in the 
development of my own views. 


When I went to Vienna all my sympathies were exclusively with the Pan- 
German movement. I was just as much impressed by the fact that they had the 
courage to shout Heil Hohenzollern as I rejoiced at their determination to 
consider themselves an integral part of the German Reich, from which they 
were separated only temporarily. 


They never missed an opportunity of explaining their attitude in public, 
which roused my enthusiasm and confidence. To avow one’s principles 
publicly on every problem that concerned Germanism, and never to make any 
compromises, seemed to me the only way to save our people. 


What I could not understand was how this movement broke down so 
soon, after such a magnificent start, and it was no less incomprehensible that 
the Christian-Socialists should gain such tremendous power within the same 
space of time. 


They had just reached the pinnacle of their popularity. When I began to 
compare those two movements, Fate placed before me the best means of 
understanding the causes of this puzzling problem. The action of Fate was, in 
this case, hastened by my own straitened circumstances. 


I shall begin my analysis with an account of the two men who must be 
regarded as the founder and leaders of the two movements. These were Georg 
von Schonerer and Dr. Karl Lueger. 


As far as personality goes, both were far above the level of the average 
parliamentary figure. They lived lives of immaculate and irreproachable 
probity amidst the bog of all-round political corruption. Personally, I first 
liked the Pan-German representative, Schonerer, and it was only afterwards 
and gradually that I felt an equal liking for the Christian-Socialist leader. 


When I compared their respective abilities, Schonerer seemed to me a 
better and more profound thinker on fundamental problems. He foresaw the 
inevitable downfall of the Austrian State more clearly and accurately than 
anyone else. 


If this warning in regard to the Habsburg Empire had been heeded in 
Germany, the disastrous World War, which involved Germany against the 


113 


whole of Europe, would never have taken place. But though Schonerer 
succeeded in penetrating to the essential of a problem he was often very much 
mistaken in his judgment of men. 


Herein lay Dr. Lueger’s special talent. He had a rare gift of insight into 
human nature and he was very careful not to take men as something better than 
they were in reality. He based his plans on the practical possibilities which 
human life offered him, whereas Schonerer had very little understanding of 
this. 


All the ideas that this Pan-German protagonist had were right in the 
abstract, but he did not have the forcefulness or understanding necessary to 
convey his ideas to the broad masses. He was not able to formulate them so 
that they could be easily grasped by the masses, whose powers of 
comprehension are limited and will always remain so. 


Therefore, all Schonerer’s knowledge was only the wisdom of a prophet 
and he never succeeded in putting it into practice. This lack of insight into 
human nature led him to form a wrong estimate of certain movements and old 
institutions. 

Schonerer realised, indeed, that the problems he had to deal with were 
in the nature of a Weltanschauung; but he did not understand that only the 
broad masses of a nation can make such convictions, which are almost of a 
religious nature, prevail. 


Unfortunately, he understood only very imperfectly how feeble is the 
fighting spirit of the so-called bourgeoisie. That weakness is due to their 
business interests, which individuals are too much afraid of risking and which 
therefore deter them from taking action. 


Generally speaking, a Weltanschauung can have no prospect of success, 
unless the broad masses declare themselves ready to act as its champion and to 
fight on its behalf wherever and to whatever extent that may be necessary. 


This failure to understand the importance of the lower strata of the 
population resulted in a very inadequate conception of the social problem. 


In all this Dr. Lueger was the opposite of Schonerer. His profound 
knowledge of human nature enabled him to forma correct estimate of the 
various social forces and it saved him from underrating the power of existing 
institutions, It was perhaps this very quality which enabled him to utilise those 


114 


institutions as a means to serve the purposes of his policy. 


He saw only too clearly that, in our epoch, the political fighting power of 
the upper classes is quite insignificant and not at all capable of fighting for the 
triumph of a great new movement. 


Thus he devoted the greatest part of his political activity to the task of 
winning over those sections of the population whose existence was in danger, a 
fact which tended to foster, rather than to paralyse, the militant spirit in them. 
He was also quick to adopt all available means for winning the support of long 
established institutions, so as to be able to derive the greatest possible 
advantage for his movement from those old sources of power. Thus it was that, 
first of all, he chose as the social basis of his new party that middle class 
which was threatened with extinction. 


In this way, he secured a solid following which was willing to make 
great sacrifices and had good fighting stamina. 


His extremely wise attitude towards the Catholic Church rapidly won 
over the younger clergy in such large numbers that the old clerical party was 
forced to retire from the field of action or else, and this was the wiser course, 
join the new party, in the hope of gradually winning back one position after 
another. 


It would be a serious injustice to the man if we were to regard this as his 
essential characteristic, for he possessed not only the qualities of an able 
tactician, but had the true genius of a great reformer although this was limited 
by his exact perception of the possibilities at hand and also of his own 
capabilities. 


The aims which this really eminent man decided to pursue were 
intensely practical. He wished to conquer Vienna, the heart of the Monarchy. It 
was from Vienna that the last pulses of life beat through the diseased and worn- 
out body of the decrepit Empire. If the heart could be made healthier, the other 
parts of the body were bound to revive. 


That idea was correct in principle, but the time within which it could be 
applied in practice was strictly limited, and that was Lueger’s weak point. His 
achievements as Burgomaster of the City of Vienna are immortal, in the best 
sense of the word, but all that could not save the Monarchy. It came too late. 


His rival, Schonerer, saw this more clearly. What Dr. Lueger undertook 


115 


to put into practice turned out marvellously successful, but the results which he 
expected to follow these achievements did not come. 


Schonerer did not attain the ends he had proposed to himself, but his 
fears were realised, alas, ina terrible fashion. Thus both these men failed to 
attain their further objectives. Lueger could not save Austria and Schonerer 
could not prevent the downfall of the German people. 


To study the causes of the failure of these two parties is to learn a lesson 
that 1s highly instructive for our own epoch. This is especially useful for my 
friends, because in many points the circumstances of our own day are similar 
to those of that time. 


Therefore, such a lesson may help us to guard against the mistakes which 
brought one of those movements to an end and rendered the other barren of 
results. In my opinion, the wreck of the Pan-German movement in Austria must 
be attributed to three causes. The first of these consisted in the fact that the 
leaders did not have a clear concentration of the importance of the social 
problem, particularly for a new movement which had an essentially 
revolutionary character. 


Schonerer and his followers directed their attention principally to the 
bourgeois classes. For that reason, their movement was bound to turn out 
mediocre and tame. The German bourgeoisie, especially in its upper circles, is 
—though the individual may not be aware of this—pacifist even to the point of 
complete self-abnegation wherever the internal affairs of the nation or State 
are concerned. 


In good times, which in this case means times of good government, such 
an attitude makes this social class extraordinarily valuable to the State, but 
when there is a bad government, such a quality has a destructive effect. 


In order to ensure the possibility of carrying through a really strenuous 
struggle, the Pan-German movement should have devoted its efforts to winning 
over the masses. 


The failure to do this left the movement from the very beginning without 
the elementary impulse which such a wave needs if it is not to ebb within a 
short while. 


In failing to see the truth of this principle clearly at the very outset of the 
movement, and in neglecting to put it into practice, the new party made an 


116 


initial mistake which could riot possibly be rectified afterwards, for the 
numerous moderate bourgeois elements admitted into the movement 
increasingly determined its internal orientation and thus destroyed all further 
prospects of gaining any appreciable support among the masses of the people. 


Under such conditions such a movement could not get beyond mere 
discussion and criticism. A faith that was almost religious and the spirit of 
sacrifice were no longer to be found in the movement. 


Their place was taken by the effort towards ‘positive’ collaboration, 
which in this case meant to acknowledge the existing state of affairs, gradually 
to tone down the bitterness of the dispute and to finish up by making a 
dishonourable peace. 


Such was the fate of the Pan-German movement, because at the start the 
leaders did not realise that the most important condition of success was that 
they should recruit their following from the broad masses of the people. The 
movement thus became bourgeois and respectable and radical only in 
moderation. 


The second cause of its rapid decline was due to this mistake. 


The position of the Germans in Austria was already desperate when Pan- 
Germanism arose. Year by year parliament was being used more and more as 
an instrument for the gradual extinction of the German- Austrian population. 

The only hope of an eleventh-hour effort to save it lay in the overthrow of the 
parliamentary system, but there was very little prospect of this happening. 
Consequently, the Pan-German movement was confronted with a question of 
primary importance. 


To overthrow the parliament, should the Pan-Germanists have entered it 
‘to undermine it from within,’ as the current phrase was? Or should they have 
assailed the institution as such from outside? 


They entered the parliament and came out defeated, but they had been 
obliged to enter it, for in order to wage an effective war against such a power 
from the outside, indomitable courage and a ready spirit of sacrifice were 
necessary. 


In such cases the bull must be seized by the horns. Furious attacks may 
bring the assailant to the ground again and again, but if he has a stout heart he 
will stand up, even though some bones may be broken, and only after a long 


117 


and tough struggle will he achieve his triumph. 


New champions are attracted to a cause by the appeal of great sacrifices 
made for its sake, until that indomitable spirit is finally crowned with success. 
To achieve this, however, one needs those who come from the broad masses of 
the people. 


They alone have the requisite determination and tenacity to fight a 
sanguinary issue through to the end. The Pan-German movement did not have 
these broad masses as its champions and so the only course left opens to it was 
to enter parliament. 


It would be a mistake to think that this decision resulted from a long 
series of internal hesitations of a moral kind, or that it was the outcome of 
careful calculation. They did not even consider any other solution. 


Those who participated in this blunder were actuated by general 
considerations and vague notions as to what would be the significance and 
effect of taking part in that institution which they had condemned on principle. 


In general they hoped that they would thus have the means of expounding 
their cause to the broad masses of the people, because they would be able to 
speak in ‘the forum of the whole nation.’ 


It also seemed reasonable to believe that by attacking the evil at the root 
they would achieve more than by attacking from outside. They believed that, if 
protected by the immunity of parliament, the position of the individual 
protagonists would be strengthened and that thus the force of their attacks 
would be enhanced. In reality everything turned out otherwise. 


The forum in which the Pan-German representatives spoke had not 
grown greater, but had actually become smaller, for each spoke only to the 
circle that was ready to listen to him or could read the report of his speech in 
the newspapers. The largest forum of immediate listeners 1s not the 
parliamentary auditorium; it is the large public meeting, for here alone will 
there be thousands of men who have come simply to hear what a speaker has to 
say, whereas at the parliamentary sitting; only a few hundred are present, and 
for the most part these are there only to earn their daily allowance for 
attendance and not to be enlightened by the wisdom of one or other of the 
‘representatives of the people.’ 


The most important consideration is that the same public is always 


118 


present and that this public does not wish to learn anything new, because, 
setting aside the question of its intelligence, it lacks even that modest quantum 
of will-power which is necessary for the effort of learning. 


Not one of the representatives of the people will pay homage to a 
superior truth and devote himself to its service. 


Not one of these gentry will act thus, unless he has grounds for hoping 
that by such a voile-face he may be able to retain the representation of his 
constituency in the coming election. 


Therefore, only when it becomes quite clear that the old party is likely to 
have a bad time of it at the forthcoming elections—only then will those models 
of manly virtue set out in search of a new party or a new policy which may 
have better electoral prospects, but of course this change of front will be 
accompanied by a veritable deluge of high moral motives to justify it, and thus 
it always happens that when an existing party has incurred such general 
disfavour among the public that it is threatened with the probability of a 
crushing defeat, a great migration commences. 


The parliamentary rats leave the party ship. All this happens not because 
the individuals in the case have become better informed on the questions at 
issue and have resolved to act accordingly; these changes of front are evidence 
only of that gift of clairvoyance which warns the parliamentary flea at the right 
moment and enables him to hop into another warm party bed. 


To speak in such a forum is to cast pearls before certain animals. Verily, 
it does not repay the pains taken, for the result must always be negative. That is 
what happened in this case. The Pan-German representatives might have talked 
themselves hoarse, but to no effect. 


The press either ignored them totally or so mutilated their speeches that 
the logical argument was destroyed or the meaning twisted round in such a way 
that the public got only a very wrong impression regarding the aims of the new 
movement. 


What the individual members said was not of importance, what was 
important was what people read as coming from them. This consisted of mere 
extracts which had been torn out of the context of the speeches and gave an 
impression of incoherent nonsense, which was exactly what was intended. 
Thus the only public to which they really spoke consisted merely of five 


119 


hundred parliamentarians and that is saying a great deal. 


The worst aspect of the case was that the Pan-German movement could 
hope for success only if the leaders realised from the very first moment that 
here it must be less a question of a new party than of a new Weltanschauung. 


This alone could arouse the inner moral forces that were necessary for 
such a gigantic struggle, and in this struggle the leaders must be men of first- 
class brains and indomitable courage. 


If the struggle on behalf of a Weltanschauung is not conducted by men of 
heroic spirit who are ready to sacrifice everything, within a short while it will 
become impossible to find real fighting followers who are ready to lay down 
their lives for the cause. 


A man who fights only for his own existence has not much interest left 
for the service of the community. 


In order to secure the conditions that are necessary for success, 
everybody concerned must be made to understand that the new movement looks 
to the future for its honour and glory, but that it has no contemporary reward to 
offer its members. 


If a movement should offer a large number of positions and offices that 
are easily accessible, the number of unworthy candidates admitted to 
membership will be constantly on the increase, and eventually a day will come 
when there will be such a preponderance of political profiteers among the 
membership of a successful party that the combatants who bore the brunt of the 
battle in the earlier stages of the movement can now scarcely recognise their 
own party and may be thrown overboard by the later arrivals as unwanted 
ballast. Then the movement will no longer have a mission to fulfil. 


Once the Pan-German party decided to collaborate with parliament they 
were no longer leaders and combatants in a popular movement, but merely 
parliamentarians. Thus the movement sank to the common political party level 
of the day and had no longer the strength to face a hostile fate and run the risk 
of martyrdom. 


Instead of fighting, the Pan-German leaders fell into the habit of talking 
and negotiating The new parliamentarians soon found that it was a more 
satisfactory, because less risky, way of fulfilling their task, if they were to 
defend the new Weltanschauung with the ‘intellectual’ weapon of 


120 


parliamentary rhetoric rather than risk their lives in a struggle, the outcome of 
which was uncertain and could, at best, offer no prospect of personal gain for 
themselves. 


When they had taken their seats in parliament their adherents outside 
hoped and waited for miracles to happen. Naturally, no such miracles 
happened or could happen. 


Thereupon the adherents of the movement soon grew impatient, because 
the reports they read about their own representatives did not in the least come 
up to what had been expected when they voted for these same representatives 
at the elections. The reason for this was not far to seek. 


It was due to the fact that an unfriendly press refrained from giving a true 
account of what the Pan-German representatives of the people were actually 
doing. 


As the new deputies got to like this mild form of ‘revolutionary’ struggle 
in parliament and in the provincial diets, they gradually became reluctant to 
resume the more, hazardous work of expounding the principles of the 
movement to the broad masses of the people. 


Mass meetings in public became more and more rare, though this 1s the 
only means of exercising a really effective influence on the people, because 
here the influence comes from direct personal contact and only in this way can 
the support of large sections of the people be obtained. 


When the tables on which the speakers used to stand in the great beer- 
halls, addressing an assembly of thousands, were deserted for the 
parliamentary tribune, and the speeches were no longer addressed to the 
people directly, but to the so-called ‘chosen’ representatives, the Pan-German 
movement lost its popular character and in a little while degenerated to the 
level of a more or less serious club where problems of the day were discussed 
academically. 


The wrong impression created by the press was no longer corrected by 
personal contact with the people at public meetings, where the individual 
representatives might have given a true account of their activities. 


The final result of this neglect was that the word ‘Pan-German’ came to 
have an unpleasant sound in the ears of the masses. The knights of the pen and 
the literary snobs of to-day ought to realise that the great reformations which 


121 


have taken place in this world were never conducted by a goosequill. 


The task of the pen must always be that of presenting the theoretical 
concepts which motivate such changes. The force which has always set in 
motion the great historical avalanches of religious and political movements is 
the magic power of the spoken word. 


The broad masses of a population are more susceptible to the appeal of 
rhetoric than to any other force. All great movements are popular movements. 


They are the volcanic eruptions of human passions and emotions, stirred 
into activity by the ruthless goddess of Adversity or by the torch of the spoken 
word cast into the midst of the people. 


In no case have great movements been set afoot by the syrupy effusions 
of aesthetic /itterateurs and drawing-room heroes. The doom of a nation can 
be averted only by a storm of glowing passion; but only those who are 
passionate themselves can arouse passion in others. 


It is only through the capacity for passionate feeling that chosen leaders 
can wield the power of the word which, like blows from a hammer, will open 
the door to the hearts of the people. 


He who is not capable of passionate feeling and speech was never 
chosen by Providence to be the herald of its will. 


Therefore, a writer should stick to his ink-bottle and busy himself with 
theoretical questions, if he has the requisite ability and knowledge. He was not 
born or chosen to be a leader. 


A movement which has great aims to achieve must carefully guard again, 
the danger of losing contact with the masses of the people. Every problem 
encountered must be examined from this point of view first of all and the 
decision taken must always be in harmony with this principle. 


The movement must avoid everything which might lessen or weaken its 
power of influencing the masses, not from demagogical motives, but because of 
the simple fact that no great ideal, no matter how sublime and exalted it may 
be, can be realised without the formidable strength of the great bulk of the 
people. 


Stern reality alone must mark the way to the goal. Only too often in this 


[22 


world, to be unwilling to walk the road of hardship means the total 
renunciation of our aims and purposes, whether that renunciation be 
consciously willed or not. 


The moment the Pan-German leaders, by virtue of their acceptance of the 
parliamentary principle, moved the centre of their activities away from the 
people and into parliament, they sacrificed the future for the sake of a cheap 
momentary success. They chose the easier way in the struggle and in doing so 
rendered themselves unworthy of the final victory. 


While in Vienna I used to ponder seriously over these questions and I 
saw that the main reason for the collapse of the Pan-German movement lay in 
the fact that these very questions were not rightly appreciated. 


To my mind the movement seemed at that time chosen to take over the 
leadership of the German element in Austria. The first two blunders which led 
to the downfall of the Pan-German movement were very closely connected 
with one another. 


Failure to recognise the inner dynamic forces which bring about great 
changes led to an inadequate appreciation of the part which the broad masses 
play in bringing about such changes. The result was that too little attention was 
given to the social problem and that the attempts made by the movement to 
capture the minds of the lower classes were too few and too weak. 


If there had been a proper appreciation of the tremendous power of 
resistance always shown by the masses in revolutionary movements, a different 
attitude towards the social problem would have been taken; and also a 
different policy in the matter of propaganda. Then the centre of gravity of the 
movement would not have been transferred to the parliament, but would have 
remained in the workshops and in the streets. 


There was a third mistake, which also had its roots in the failure to 
understand the significance of the broad masses. The masses are first set in 
motion, in a definite direction, by men of superior talents; but then these 
masses, once in motion, are like a flywheel inasmuch as they sustain the 
momentum and steady balance of the offensive. 


The policy of the Pan-German leaders in deciding to carry through a 
difficult fight against the Catholic Church can be explained only by attributing 
it to an inadequate understanding of the spiritual character of the people. 


123 


The reasons why the new party engaged in a violent campaign against 
Rome were as follows: As soon as the House of Habsburg had definitely 
decided to transform Austria into a Slav state, all sorts of measures were 
adopted which seemed suitable for that purpose. 


The Habsburg rulers had no scruples of conscience about exploiting 
even religious institutions in the service of this new ‘State idea.’ 


One of the many methods employed was the use of Czech parishes and 
their clergy as instruments in the Slavisation of Austria, which was carried out 
in the following way. Parish priests of Czech nationality were appointed to 
purely German districts. Gradually and steadily pushing the interests of the 
Czech people before those of the Church, the parish priests became generative 
cells in the process of de-Germanisation. 


Unfortunately, the German-Austrian clergy completely failed to counter 
this Procedure. Not only were they incapable of taking a similar initiative on 
the German side, but they showed themselves unable to meet the Czech 
offensive with adequate resistance. 


The German element was accordingly pushed backwards, slowly but 
steadily, through the perversion of religious belief for political ends, on the 
one side, and the lack of proper resistance on the other. 


Such were the tactics used in dealing with the minor problems, but those 
used in dealing with the major problems were not very different. 


The anti-German aims pursued by the Habsburgs, especially through the 
instrumentality of the higher clergy, did not meet with any vigorous resistance, 
while the clerical representatives of the German interests withdrew completely 
to the rear. 


The general impression created could not be other than that the Catholic 
clergy as such were grossly neglecting the rights of the German population. 
Therefore, it looked as if the Catholic Church was not in sympathy with the 
German people, but that it unjustly supported their adversaries. 


The root of the whole evil, especially in Schénerer’s opinion, lay in the 
fact that the centre of authority of the Catholic Church was not in Germany and 
that this fact alone was sufficient reason for the hostile attitude of the Church 
towards the demands of our people. 


124 


The so-called cultural problem receded almost completely into the 
background, as was generally the case throughout Austria at that time. 


In assuming a hostile attitude towards the Catholic Church, the Pan- 
German leaders were influenced not so much by the Church’s attitude 
regarding questions of science, etc., but principally by the fact that the Church 
did not defend German rights, as it should have done, but always supported 
those who encroached on these rights, especially the Slavs. 


Georg Schonerer was not a man who did things by halves. He went into 
battle against the Church because he was convinced that this was the only way 
in which the German people could be saved. 


The Los-von-Rom (“Away from Rome’) movement seemed the most 
formidable, but at the same time most difficult, method of attacking and 
destroying the adversary’s citadel. Schonerer believed that if this movement 
could be carried out successfully the unfortunate division between the two 
great religious denominations in Germany would be wiped out and that the 
inner forces of the German Reich and the German nation would be enormously 
enhanced by such a victory. 


But in this case the premises as well as the conclusions were erroneous. 


It was undoubtedly true that the national powers of resistance, in 
everything concerning Germanism as such, were much weaker among the 
German Catholic clergy, than among their non-German colleagues, especially 
the Czechs, and only an ignorant person could be unaware of the fact that it 
scarcely ever entered the minds of the German clergy to take the offensive on 
behalf of German interests. 


At the same time, everybody who is not blind to facts must admit that all 
this should be attributed to a characteristic under which we Germans are all 
doomed to suffer. This characteristic shows itself in our objective attitude 
towards our own nationality, as towards other things. 


While the Czech priest adopted a subjective attitude towards his own 
people and only an objective attitude towards the Church, the German parish 
priest showed a subjective devotion to his Church and remained objective in 
regard to his nation. 


It is a phenomenon which, unfortunately for us, can be observed 
occurring in exactly the same way in thousands of other spheres. It is by no 


125 


means the peculiar heritage of Catholicism, but it is something in us which 
does not take long to undermine almost every institution, especially institutions 
of the State and those which have ideal aims. 


Take, for example, the attitude of our civil service in regard to the efforts 
made to bring about a national resurgence and compare that attitude with the 
stand which the civil service in any other country would have taken in such a 
case. Or, can anyone believe that the military officers in any other country in 
the world would place the ‘authority of the State’ before the vital needs of the 
nation, as they have done as a matter of course in our country for the past five 
years and have even deemed theirs a meritorious attitude? 


Or, let us take another example. In regard to the Jewish Problem, do not 
the two Christian denominations take up a standpoint to-day which does not 
correspond to the national exigencies or even the interests of religion? 


Consider the attitude of a Jewish Rabbi towards any question, even one 
of minor importance, concerning the Jews as a race, and compare his attitude 
with that of the majority of our clergy, whether Catholic or Protestant. 


We observe the same phenomenon wherever it is a matter of standing up 
for some abstract idea. ‘The authority of the State,’ “democracy,” ‘pacifism,’ 
‘international solidarity,’ etc., all such notions become rigid, dogmatic 
conceptions with us, so that the general vital needs of the nation are judged 
purely in the light of these conceptions. 


This unfortunate habit of looking at all national demands from the point 
of view of a pre-conceived notion makes it impossible for us to see the 
subjective side of a thing which objectively contradicts our own doctrine. 


It finally leads to a complete reversal of the relation of means and end. 
Any attempt at a national revival will be opposed, if the preliminary condition 
of such a revival be that a bad and pernicious regime must first of all be 
overthrown, because such an action will be considered as a violation of the 
‘authority of the State.’ 


In the eyes of those who take that standpoint, the ‘authority of the State’ is 
not a means which is there to serve an end, but rather, to the mind of the 
dogmatic believer in objectivity, an end in itself, which suffices as the whole 
purpose of his own miserable existence. 


Such people would raise an outcry if, for instance, anyone should attempt 


126 


to set up a dictatorship, even though the dictator 1n question were a Frederick 
the Great and the politicians for the time being, who constituted the 
parliamentary majority, were petty and incompetent men, because to such 
sticklers for abstract principles, the law of democracy is more sacred than the 
welfare of the nation. 


In accordance with his principles, one of these gentry will defend the 
worst kind of tyranny, though it may be leading a people to ruin, because it is 
the fleeting embodiment of the ‘authority of the State’ and another will reject 
even a highly beneficial government if it should happen not to be in accord 
with his notion of ‘democracy.’ 


In the same way, our German pacifist will remain silent while the nation 
is groaning under an, oppression which 1s being exercised by a blood-thirsty 
military power, if this state of affairs can be altered only through active 
resistance and the employment of physical force, which is contrary to the spirit 
of the pacifist associations. The German international Socialist may be robbed 
and plundered by his comrades in all the other countries of the world, in the 
name of ‘solidarity,’ but he responds with fraternal kindness and never thinks 
of trying to get his own back, or even of defending himself. And why? Because 
he is a German. 


It may be unpleasant to dwell on such truths, but if something is to be 
clone we must start by diagnosing the disease. 


The phenomenon which I have just described also accounts for the feeble 
manner in which German interests are promoted and defended by a section of 
the clergy. 


Such conduct is not the manifestation of a malicious intent, nor 1s it the 
outcome of orders given from ‘above,’ as we say, but such a lack of national 
grit and determination is due to defects in our educational system, on the one 
hand, which fails to imbue our youth with a sense of pride in their German 
nationality, and, on the other, to our subjection to the ideal which has become 
our idol. 


The education which makes men the devotees of such abstract notions as 
‘democracy,’ ‘international Socialism,’ ‘pacifism,’ etc., is so hard-and-fast and 
exclusive and, operating as it does from within outwards, so purely subjective, 
that in forming their general picture of outside life as a whole, they are 
fundamentally influenced by these a priori notions. 


127 


On the other hand, their attitude towards their own German nationality 
has been very objective from youth upwards. The pacifist—if he is a German 
—who surrenders himself subjectively, body and soul, to the dictates of his 
dogmatic principles, will always first consider the objective right or wrong of 
a Situation when danger, no matter how grave and unmerited, threatens his own 
people and he will never take his stand in the ranks of his own people and fight 
for and with them from the sheer instinct of self-preservation. 


Another example may further illustrate how far this applies to the 
different religious denominations. Insofar as its origin and tradition are based 
on German ideals, Protestantism defends these ideals better, but it fails the 
moment it is called upon to defend national interests which belong to a sphere 
outside its ideals and traditional development, or which, for some reason or 
other, are rejected by it. 


Protestantism, therefore, will always take its part in promoting German 
ideals as far as concerns moral integrity or national education, when the 
essential German character, the German language or German freedom are to be 
defended, because these represent the principles on which Protestantism itself 
is grounded. 


But this same Protestantism violently opposes every attempt to rescue the 
nation from the clutches of its mortal enemy, because the Protestant attitude 
towards the Jews is more or less rigidly and dogmatically fixed. And yet this 
is the first problem which has to be solved, unless all attempts to bring about a 
German renascence are doomed to turn out ridiculous and impossible. 


During my sojourn in Vienna I had ample leisure and opportunity to study 
this problem without allowing, any prejudices to intervene, and in my daily 
intercourse with people I was able to test in a thousand ways the correctness of 
the opinion I had formed. 


Here, at the meeting-place of many nationalities, it was obvious that it 
was always the German pacifist who tried to consider the interests of his own 
nation objectively, but you would never find a Jew who adopted a similar 
attitude towards his own race. 


Furthermore, I found that only the German Socialist is ‘international’ in 
the sense that he feels himself obliged not to demand justice for his own people 
in any other manner than by whining and wailing to his international comrades. 


128 


Nobody could ever reproach Czechs or Poles or other nations with such 
conduct. In short, even at that time, I recognised that this evil is only partly the 
result of the doctrines taught by socialism, pacifism, etc., but mainly the result 
of our totally inadequate system of education, the defects of which are 
responsible for the lack of devotion to our own nationality. 


Therefore, the first theoretical argument advanced by the Pan-German 
leaders, in support of their offensive against Catholicism was quite untenable. 


The only way to remedy the evil of which I have been speaking is to 
train the Germans from youth upwards to an absolute recognition of the rights 
of their own people, instead of poisoning their minds, while they are still 
children, with the virus of this cursed ‘objectivity,’ even in matters concerning 
the very preservation of our own existence. 


The result of this would be that the Catholic in Germany, just as in 
Ireland, Poland or France, will be a German first and foremost, but this 
presupposes the establishment of a radical national government. 


The strongest proof in support of my contention is furnished by what took 
place when our people were called for the last time before the tribunal of 
History to defend their own existence, in a life-and-death struggle. 


As long as there was no lack of leadership in the higher circles, the 
people fulfilled their duty and obligations to an overwhelming extent. Whether 
Protestant pastor or Catholic priest, each did his very utmost to help our 
powers of resistance to hold out, not only in the trenches, but also, and to an 
even greater degree, at home. 


During those years, and especially during the first outburst of enthusiasm, 
there was for both religious camps one undivided and sacred German Reich 
for whose preservation and future existence they all prayed to Heaven. 


The Pan-German movement in Austria ought to have asked itself this one 
question, “Is the preservation of the German element in Austria possible, as 
long as that element remains within the fold of the Catholic Church?’ If so, then 
the political party should not have meddled in religious and denominational 
questions, but if not, then a religious reformation should have been started and 
not a political party movement. 


Anyone who believes that a religious reformation can be achieved 
through the agency ofa political organisation shows that he has no idea of the 


129 


development of religious conceptions and doctrines of faith and how these are 
put into practice by a Church. 


No man can serve two masters, and I hold that the foundation or 
overthrow ofa religion has far more serious consequences than the foundation 
or overthrow of a State, to say nothing of a party. 


It is no argument to the contrary to say that the attacks were only 
defensive measures against attacks from the other side. 


Undoubtedly, there have always been unscrupulous rogues who did not 
hesitate to use religion as an instrument in their political dealings, for such, 
was usually the sole object of such fellows, but on the other hand, it would be 
wrong to hold religion itself, or a religious denomination, responsible for a 
number of rascals who exploit the Church for their own base interests just as 
they would exploit anything else in which they had a part. 


Nothing could be more to the taste of one of these parliamentary loungers 
and tricksters than to be able to find a scapegoat at least, after the event, for his 
political sharp practice. 


The moment religion or a religious denomination is attacked and made 
responsible for his personal misdeeds, this shrewd fellow will raise an outcry 
at once and call the world to witness how justified he was in acting as he did, 
proclaiming that he and his eloquence alone have saved religion and the 
Church. 


The public, which is mostly stupid and has a very short memory, is not 
capable of recognising the real instigator of the quarrel in the midst of the 
turmoil that has been raised. 


Frequently it does not remember the beginning of the fight and so the 
rogue gains his end. A cunning fellow of that sort is quite well aware that his 
misdeeds have nothing to do with religion, and so he will laugh up his sleeve 
all the more heartily when his honest, but artless, adversary loses the game 
and, one day losing all faith in humanity, retires from public life. 


But also from another point of view it would be wrong to make religion, 
or the Church as such, responsible for the misdeeds of individuals. 


If we compare the magnitude of the organisation, as it is apparent to 
everyone, with the average weakness of human nature we shall have to admit 


130 


that the proportion of good to bad is more favourable here than anywhere else. 


Among the priests there may, of course, be some who use their sacred 
calling to further their political ambitions. There are clergy who, unfortunately, 
forget that in the political mélée they ought to be the champions of sublime truth 
and not the abettors of falsehood and slander, but for each one of these 
unworthy specimens we can find a thousand or more, who fulfil their mission 
nobly as the trustworthy guardians of souls and who tower above the level of 
our corrupt epoch, as little islands above the universal swamp. 


I cannot, and do not, condemn the Church as such if some depraved 
person in the robe of a priest commits some offence against the moral code; 
nor should I for a moment think of blaming the Church if one of its innumerable 
members betrays and besmirches his compatriots, especially in an epoch when 
such conduct is quite common. 


We must not forget, particularly in our day, that for one such Ephialtes 
there are a thousand whose hearts bleed in sympathy with their people during 
these, our year; of misfortune and who, together with the best of our nation, 
yearn for the hour when Fortune will smile on us again. 


If it be objected that here we are concerned not with the petty problems 
of everyday life, but principally with fundamental truths and questions of 
dogma, the only way of answering that objection is to ask the question, ‘Do you 
feel that Providence least called you to proclaim the Truth to the world?’ 


If so, then go and do it, but you ought to have the courage to do it directly 
and not use some political party as your mouthpiece, for this, too, would be 
false. In the place of something that now exists and is bad, put something else 
that 1s better and will last into the future. 


If you lack the requisite courage, or if you yourself do not know clearly 
what your better self ought to be, leave the whole thing alone but, whatever 
happens, do not try to reach the goal by the roundabout way of a political party 
if you are not brave enough to fight with your visor lifted. 


Political parties have no right to meddle in religious questions except 
when these relate to something that is alien to the nation and thus calculated to 
undermine racial customs and morals. 


In the same way, religion must not be mixed up with party politics. If 
some ecclesiastical dignitaries should misuse religious institutions or religious 


131 


teachings to injure their own ration, their opponents ought never to take the 
same road and fight them with the same weapons. 


To a political leader, the religious teachings and institutions of his 
people should be sacred and inviolable; otherwise, he should not be a 
statesman, but a reformer, if he has the necessary qualities for such a mission. 
Any other line of conduct will lead to disaster, especially in Germany. In 
studying the Pan-German movement and its conflict with Rome I was firmly 
persuaded, then and especially in later years, that by their failure to understand 
the importance of the social problem, the Pan-Germanists lost the support of 
the broad masses, who are the indispensable combatants in such a movement. 


By entering parliament the Pan-German leaders deprived themselves of 
their clan, and at the same time burdened themselves with all the defects of the 
parliamentary institution. Their struggle against the Catholic Church made their 
position impossible in numerous circles among the lower and middle classes, 
while at the same time it robbed them of innumerable high-class elements some 
of the best indeed that the nation possessed. 


The practical outcome of the Austrian Kulturkamp was negative. 
Although they succeeded in wresting one hundred thousand members from the 
Church, that did not do much harm to the latter. 


The Church did not need to shed tears over these lost sheep, for it lost 
only those who had for a long time ceased to belong to it in their inner hearts. 
The difference between this new reformation and the great Reformation was 
that, at that time, some of the best members left the Church because of religious 
convictions, whereas in this new reformation only those left who had been 
indifferent before and who were now influenced by political considerations. 
From the political point of view alone, the result was a ridiculous as it was 
deplorable. 


Once again a political movement which had promised so much for the 
German nation collapsed, because it was not conducted ina spirit of 
unflinching adherence to naked reality, but lost itself in spheres in which it was 
bound to be broken up. 


The Pan-German movement would never have made this mistake if it had 
properly understood the psyche of the broad masses. If the leaders had known 
that, for psychological reasons alone, it is not expedient to place two or more 
adversaries before the masses—since that leads to a complete splitting up of 


132 


their fighting strength—they would have concentrated the full and undivided 
force of their attack against a single adversary. 


Nothing in the policy ofa political party is so fraught with danger as 
allowing its decisions to be directed by people who want to have their fingers 
in every pie though they do not know how to cook the simplest dish. 


Even though there is much that can be said against the various religious 
denominations, political leaders must not forget that history teaches us that no 
purely political party in similar circumstances ever succeeded in bringing 
about a religious reformation. 


One does not study history for the purpose of forgetting its lessons 
afterwards, when the time comes to apply them, or of imagining that in this 
particular case things are different, so that the eternal truths of history are no 
longer applicable. 


One learns history in order to be able to apply its lessons to the present 
time and whoever fails to do this cannot pretend to be a political leader. 


In reality he is quite a superficial person or, as is mostly the case, a 
conceited simpleton whose good intentions cannot make up for his 
incompetence. 


The art of leadership, as displayed by really great leaders of the people 
throughout the ages, consists in concentrating the attention of the people against 
a single adversary and taking care that nothing will divide that attention. 


The more the militant energies of the people are directed towards one 
objective, the greater will be its magnetic force and its striking power. The 
leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if 
they belonged to one category, for weak and wavering natures among a 
leader’s following may easily begin to be dubious about the justice of their 
own cause if they have to face several enemies. 


As soon as the vacillating masses find themselves facing an opposition 
that is made up of different groups of enemies, their sense of objectivity will 
be aroused and they will ask how it is that all the others can be in the wrong 
and they themselves, and their movement, alone in the right. 


Such a feeling would be the first step towards a paralysis of their 
fighting vigour. Where there are various enemies who are split up into 


133 


divergent groups it will be necessary to block them together as forming one 
solid front, so that the bulk of the followers in a popular movement may see 
only one common enemy against whom they have to fight. 


Such uniformity intensifies their belief in the justice of their own cause 
and strengthens their feeling of hostility towards the opponent. 


The Pan-German movement was unsuccessful because the leaders did 
not grasp the significance of that truth. They saw the goal clearly and their 
intentions were right, but they took the wrong road. 


Their action may be compared to that of an Alpine climber who never 
loses sight of the peak he wants to reach, who has set out with the greatest 
determination and energy, but pays no attention to the road beneath his feet. 
With his eye always fixed firmly on the goal, he does not examine or notice the 
nature of the ascent, and finally he fails. 


The manner in which the great rival of the Pan-German party set out to 
attain its goal was quite different. The way it took was well and shrewdly 
chosen, but it did not have a clear vision of the goal. On almost all points 
where the Pan-German movement failed, the policy, of the Christian Socialist 
party was correct and systematic. 


They assessed the importance of the broad masses correctly and gained 
their support by emphasising the social character of the movement from the 
very start. By directing their appeal especially to the lower middle class and 
the artisans, they gained adherents who were faithful, persevering and self- 
sacrificing. 


The Christian-Socialist leaders took care to avoid all controversy with 
religious institutions and thus they secured the support of that mighty 
organisation, the Catholic Church. The leaders recognised the value of 
propaganda on a large scale and they were veritable virtuosos in working up 
the spiritual instincts of the broad masses of their adherents. 


The failure of this party to carry into effect the dream of saving Austria 
from dissolution, must be attributed to two main defects in the means they 
employed, and also to the lack of a clear perception of the ends they wished to 
reach. 


The anti-Semitism of the Christian-Socialists was based on religious, 
instead of racial, principles. The reason for this mistake also gave rise to the 


134 


second error. 


The founders of the Christian-Socialist party were of the opinion that 
they could not base their attitude on the racial principle if they wished to save 
Austria, because they felt that a general disintegration of the State might 
quickly result from the adoption of such a policy. 


In the opinion of the party chiefs, the situation in Vienna demanded that 
all factors which tender to estrange the nationalities from one another should 
be carefully avoided and that all factors making for unity should be 
emphasised. 


At that time Vienna was so honeycombed with foreign elements, 
especially Czech, that the greatest amount of tolerance was necessary if these 
elements were to be enlisted in the ranks of any party that was not anti-German 
on principle. 


If Austria was to be saved, those elements were indispensable, and so 
attempts were made to win the support of the small traders, a great number of 
whom were Czechs, by combating the liberalism of the Manchester School. 


The leaders believed that by adopting this attitude they had found a 
slogan against Jewry which, because of its religious implications, would unite 
all the different nationalities which made up the population of the old Austria. 


It was obvious, however, that this kind of anti-Semitism did not trouble 
the Jews very much. If the worst came to the worst, a few drops of baptismal 
water would settle the matter, whereupon the Jew could still carry on his 
business safely and at the same time retain his Jewish entity. 


On such superficial grounds it was impossible to deal with the whole 
problem in an earnest and rational way. The consequence was that many 
people could not understand this kind of anti-Semitism and therefore refused to 
take part in it. 


The attractive force of the idea was thus restricted exclusively to 
narrow-minded circles, because the leaders failed to go beyond the mere 
emotional appeal and did not ground their position on a truly rational basis. 


The intellectuals were opposed to such a policy on principle. It looked 
more and more as if the whole movement were a new attempt to proselytize the 
Jews or, on the other hand, as if it were merely organised from a wish to 


130 


compete with other contemporary movements. 


Thus the struggle lost all traces of having been organised for a spiritual 
and sublime mission. Indeed, it seemed to some people—and these were by no 
means worthless elements—to be immoral and reprehensible. The movement 
failed to awaken a belief that here there was a problem of vital importance for 
the whole of humanity, on the solution of which the destiny of the whole non- 
Jewish world depended. 


Through this shilly-shallying way of dealing with the problem, the anti- 
Semitism of the Christian-Socialists turned out to be quite ineffective. It was 
anti-Semitic only in outward appearance which was worse than if it had made 
no pretence at all to anti-Semitism, for the pretence gave rise to a false sense 
of security among people who believed that the enemy had been brought to bay, 
but, as a matter of fact, these people themselves were being led by the nose. 


The Jew readily adjusted himself to this form of anti-Semitism and found 
its continuance more profitable to him than its abolition would have been. 


This whole attitude led to great sacrifices being made for the sake of that 
State which was composed of many heterogeneous nationalities, but much 
greater sacrifices had to be made by the representatives of the German 
element. 


It was impossible to adopt a ‘nationalist’ attitude for fear of losing the 
foothold gained in Vienna itself. It was hoped that the Habsburg State might be 
saved by a silent evasion of the nationalist question, but it was this very policy 
that brought that State to ruin. 


The same policy also led to the collapse of Christian Socialism, for thus 
the movement was deprived of the only source of energy from which a 
political party can draw the inner driving force it needs. 


During those years I carefully followed the two movements and 
observed how they developed, one because my heart was with it, and d the 
other, because of my admiration for that remarkable man who then appeared to 
me bitterly symbolic of the whole German population in Austria. 


When the imposing funeral cortége of the dead Burgomaster wound its 
way from the City Hall towards the Ring Strasse, I stood among the hundreds 
of thousands who watched the solemn procession pass by. 


136 


As I stood there I felt deeply moved, and my instinct told me that the 
work of this man had been all in vain, because a sinister Fate was inexorably 
leading this State to its downfall. 


If Dr. Karl Lueger had lived in Germany he would have been ranked 
among the great leaders of our people. It was a misfortune for himself and for 
his work that he had to live in this impossible State. 


When he died, the fire had already been kindled in the Balkans and was 
spreading month by month. Fate had been merciful in sparing him the sight of 
what, even to the last, he had hoped to prevent. 


I endeavoured to analyse the cause which rendered one of these 
movements futile and wrecked the progress of the other. The result of this 
investigation was the profound conviction that, apart from the inherent 
impossibility of consolidating the position of the State in the old Austria, the 
two parties made the following fatal mistake. 


The Pan-German party was perfectly right in its fundamental ideas 
regarding the aim of the movement, which was to bring about a German 
renascence, but it was unfortunate in its choice of means. 


It was nationalist, but unfortunately it paid too little heed to the social 
problem, and thus it failed to gain the support of the masses. 


Its anti-Jewish policy, however, was grounded on a correct perception of 
the significance of the racial problem and not on religious principles, but it 
was a mistake, and wrong froma tactical point of view to make war on one 
religious denomination. 


The Christian-Socialist movement had only a vague conception of a 
German revival as part of its object, but it was intelligent and fortunate in the 
choice of means to carry out its policy as a party. The Christian-Socialists 
grasped the significance of the social question, but they adopted the wrong 
principles in their struggle against Jewry, and they utterly failed to appreciate 
the power of the national idea. 


Had the Christian-Socialist party, apart from its shrewd estimate of the 
value of the broad masses, also gauged correctly the importance of the racial 
problem (which was properly grasped by the Pan-German movement) and had 
this party been really nationalist, or if the Pan-German leaders, on the other 
hand, in addition to their correct handling of the Jewish problem and of the 


137 


national idea, had adopted the practical standpoint of the Christian-Socialist 
Party, and particularly their attitude towards Socialism—then a movement 
would have developed which, in my opinion, might even at that time have 
successfully altered the course of German history. 


If things did not turn out thus, the fault lay for the most part in the 
character of the Austrian State. 


I did not find my own convictions upheld by any party then in existence, 
and so I could not bring myself to enlist as a member in any of the existing 
organisations or even lend a hand in their struggle. Even at that time all those 
organisations seemed to me to be already jaded in their energies and were 
therefore incapable of bringing about a really profound and not merely 
superficial national revival of the German people. 


My inner aversion to the Habsburg State was daily increasing. The more 
I paid special attention to questions of foreign policy, the more the conviction 
grew upon me that this phantom State would surely bring misfortune on the 
Germans. 


I realised more and more that the destiny of the German nation could not 
be decisively influenced from here, but only from within the German Reich 
itself. 


This was true not only in regard to general political questions, but also 
—and in no less a degree—in regard to the whole sphere of cultural life. 


Here, also, in all matters affecting national culture and art, the Austrian 
State showed all the signs of senile decrepitude, or at least it was ceasing to be 
of any consequence to the German nation, as far as these matters were 
concerned. 


This was especially true of its architecture. Modern architecture could 
not produce any great results in Austria, because, since the building of the Ring 
Strasse, architectural activity, in Vienna it least, had become insignificant when 
compared with the progressive schemes which were being planned in 
Germany. 


I came more and more to lead what may be called a two-fold existence. 
Reason and reality forced me to continue to endure my harsh, but beneficial, 
experience in Austria, but my heart was elsewhere. 


138 


A feeling of discontent grew upon me and made one depressed the more 
I came to realise the inside hollowness of this State and the impossibility of 
saving it from collapse. At the same time I felt perfectly certain that 1t would 
bring all kinds of misfortune on the German people. 


I was convinced that the Habsburg State would baulk and hinder every 
German who might show signs of real greatness, while at the same time it 
would aid and abet every non-German activity. 


This conglomerate spectacle of heterogeneous races which the capital of 
the Dial Monarchy presented, this motley of Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, 
Ruthenians, Serbs and Croats, etc., and always that bacillus which is the 
solvent of human society, the Jew, here and there and everywhere—the whole 
spectacle was repugnant to me. The gigantic city seemed to be the incarnation 
of racial adulteration. 


The German language, which I had spoken from the time of my boyhood, 
was the vernacular of Lower Bavaria. I never forgot that particular style of 
speech, and I could never learn the Viennese dialect. 


The longer I lived in that city, the stronger became my hatred of the 
promiscuous swarm of foreign peoples which had begun to batten on that old 
nursery-ground of German culture. The idea that this State could maintain its 
further existence for any considerable time was quite absurd. 


Austria was then like an ancient mosaic in which the cohesive cement 
had dried up and become old and friable. As long as such a work of art 
remains untouched it may hold together and continue to exist, but the moment a 
blow falls on it, it breaks up into thousands of fragments. 


It was, therefore, now only a question of when the blow would come. 
Because my heart was always with the German Reich and not with the Austrian 
Monarchy, the hour of Austria’s dissolution as a State appeared to me only as 
the first step towards the emancipation of the German nation. 


All these considerations intensified, my yearning to depart for that 
country for which my heart had been secretly longing since the days of my 
youth. I hoped that one day I might be able to make my mark as an, architect 
and that I could devote my talents to the service of my country on a large, or on 
a small scale, according to the will of Fate. 


A final reason was that I longed to be among those who lived and 


139 


worked in that land from which the movement should be launched, the object of 
which would be the fulfilment of what my heart had always longed for, namely, 
the union of the country in which I was born with our common Fatherland, the 
German Reich. 


There are many who may not understand how such a yearning can be so 
strong, but I appeal especially to two groups of people. The first includes all 
those who are denied the happiness I have spoken of, and the second embraces 
those who once enjoyed that happiness, but have had it torn from them by a 
harsh fate. 


I turn to all those who have been torn from their mother-country and who 
have to struggle for the preservation of their most sacred patrimony, their 
native language, who are persecuted and, because of their loyalty and love for 
the homeland, yearn sadly for the hour when they will be allowed to return to 
the bosom of their mother country. 


To these I address my words, and I know that they will understand. Only 
he who has himself experienced what it means to be a German and yet to be 
denied the right of belonging to his Fatherland, can appreciate the profound 
nostalgia which that enforced exile causes. 


It is a perpetual heartache, and there is no place for joy and contentment 
until the doors of the home of his fathers are thrown open and all those in 
whose veins kindred blood is flowing will find peace and rest within their 
common Reich. 


Vienna was a hard school for me, but it taught me the most profound 
lessons of my life. I was scarcely more than a boy when I went to live there, 
and when I left, I had grown to be a man of a grave and pensive nature. 


In Vienna I acquired the foundation of a general Weltanschauung and 
developed a faculty for analysing political questions in detail. That 
Weltanschauung and the political ideas then formed have never been 
abandoned, though they were expanded later on. It is only now that I can fully 
appreciate how valuable those years were to me. 


I have given a detailed account of this period because in Vienna stark 
reality taught me the truths that now form the fundamental principles of the 
Party which, within the course of five years, has grown from modest 
beginnings to be a great mass movement. 


140 


I do not know what my attitude towards Jewry, Social Democracy, or 
rather Marxism, in general, to the social problem, etc., would be to-day if I had 
not acquired a stock of personal beliefs at such an early age, by dint of hard 
study and under the duress of Fate. 


For, although the misfortunes of the Fatherland may have stimulated 
thousands to ponder over the inner causes of the collapse, that could not lead to 
such a thorough knowledge and deep insight as a man develops who has fought 
a hard struggle; for many years in order that he might be master of his own fate.

CHAPTER IV: MUNICH 


At last I went to Munich, in the Spring of 1912. The city itself was as 
familiar to me as if I had lived for years within its walls. This was because my 
studies in architecture had been constantly turning my attention to the 
metropolis of German art. 


One must know Munich if one would know Germany, and it is 
impossible to acquire a knowledge of German art without seeing Munich. 


All things considered, this pre-war sojourn was by far the happiest and 
most contented time of my life. My earnings were very slender, but after all, I 
did not live for the sake of painting. I painted in order to get the bare 
necessities of existence while I continued my studies. 


I was firmly convinced that I should finally succeed in reaching the goal 
I had marked out for myself, and this conviction alone was strong enough to 
enable me to bear the petty hardships of everyday life without worrying very 
much about them. 


Moreover, almost from the very first moment of my sojourn there, I came 
to love that city more than any other place known to me. 


‘A German city,’ I said to myself. ‘How different from Vienna!’ It was 
with a feeling of disgust that my imagination reverted to that conglomeration of 
races. 


Another pleasant feature here was the way the people spoke German, 
which was much nearer my own way of speaking than the Viennese idiom. The 
Munich idiom recalled the days of my youth, especially when I spoke with 
those who had come to Munich from Lower Bavaria. 


There were a thousand or more things which I loved, instinctively, or 
which I came to love during the course of my stay, but what attracted me most 
was the marvellous accord of native folk-energy with the fine artistic spirit of 
the city, that unique harmony between the Hofbrauhaus and the Odeon, the 
October Festival and the Pinakothek, etc. 


The reason why my heart’s strings are entwined around this city as 
around no other spot in this world is probably because Munich is, and will 
remain, inseparably connected with the development of my own career; and the 


144 


fact that, from the beginning of my stay, I felt inwardly happy and contented is 
to be attributed to the charm which the marvellous capital of the House of 
Wittelsbach has for anyone who, apart froma gift of cool calculation, is 
blessed with a feeling for beauty. 


Apart from my professional work, I was most interested in the study of 
current political events, particularly those which were connected with foreign 
policy. 


I approached these by way of the German policy of alliances which, ever 
since my Austrian days, I had considered to be an utterly mistaken one, but in 
Vienna I had not yet seen quite clearly how far the German Reich had 
progressed in self-delusion. 


In Vienna I was inclined to assume, or probably I persuaded myself to do 
so in order to excuse the German mistake, that possibly the authorities in 
Berlin knew how weak and unreliable their ally would prove to be when 
brought face to face with realities, but that, for more or less mysterious 
reasons, they refrained from allowing their opinion on this point to be made 
public. 


Their idea was that they should support the policy of alliances which 
Bismarck had initiated, the sudden discontinuance of which might be 
undesirable, if for no other reason than that it might arouse those foreign 
countries which were lying in wait for their chance, or might alarm the 
Philistines at home. 


My contact with the people soon taught me, to my horror, that my 
assumptions were wrong. I was amazed to find everywhere, even in circles 
otherwise well informed, that nobody had the slightest intimation of the real 
character of the Habsburg Monarchy. 


Among the common people in particular, there was a prevalent illusion 
that the Austrian ally was a power which would have to be seriously reckoned 
with and would ‘do its bit’ in the hour of need. The bulk of the people 
continued to look upon the Dual Monarchy as a ‘German’ State and believed 
that it, could be relied upon. They assumed that its strength could be measured 
by the millions of its subjects, as was the case in Germany. 


First of all, they did not realise that Austria had ceased to be a German 
State and, secondly, that the conditions prevailing within the Austrian Empire 


145 


were steadily pushing it headlong to the brink of disaster. 


At that time I knew the condition of affairs in the Austrian State better 
than the professional diplomats. Blindfolded, as nearly always, these 
diplomats stumbled along on their way to disaster. The opinions prevailing 
among the people reflected only what had been drummed into them from 
above, and these higher authorities grovelled before the ‘ally,’ as the people of 
old bowed down before the Golden Calf. 


They probably thought that by being polite and amiable they might 
balance the lack of honesty on the other side, and at the same time, they took 
every declaration at its full face value. 


Even while in Vienna, I used to be annoyed again and again by the 
discrepancy between the speeches of the official statesmen and the contents of 
the Viennese press, and yet Vienna was still a German city, at least as far as 
appearances went. 


But one encountered an utterly different state of things on leaving Vienna, 
or rather German-Austria, and coming into the Slav provinces. It was only 
necessary to glance at the Prague newspapers in order to see how the whole 
exalted hocus-pocus of the Triple Alliance was judged there. 


In Prague they had nothing but gibes and sneers for that masterpiece of 
statesmanship. Even in the piping times of peace, when the two emperors 
kissed each other on the brow in token of friendship, these papers did not 
disguise their belief that the alliance would be liquidated the moment the first 
attempt was made to bring it down from the shimmering heights of a 
Nibelungen ideal to the plane of stem reality. 


Great indignation was aroused a few years later, when the alliances 
were put to the first practical test. Italy not only withdrew from the Triple 
Alliance, leaving the other two members to go their own way, but she even 
joined their enemies. 


That anybody should believe even for a moment in the possibility of such 
a miracle as that of Italy fighting on the same side as Austria, would be simply 
incredible to any man who did not suffer from the blindness of official 
diplomacy. 


In Austria only the Habsburgs and the German- Austrians supported the 
alliance. The Habsburgs did so from shrewd calculation of their own interests 


146 


and from necessity. 


The Germans did it out of good faith and political ignorance. They acted 
in good faith inasmuch as they believed that by establishing the Triple Alliance 
they were doing a great service to the German Reich and were thus helping to 
strengthen it and consolidate its defence. 


They showed their political ignorance, however, in holding such ideas, 
because, instead of helping the German Reich, they really chained it to a 
moribund State which might drag its associate into the grave with itself. 


Above all, by championing this alliance they fell more and more a prey 
to the Habsburg policy of de-Germanisation, for the alliance gave the 
Habsburgs good grounds for believing that the German Reich would not 
interfere in their domestic affairs and thus they were in a position to carry into 
effect, with more ease and less risk, their domestic policy of gradually 
eliminating the German element. 


Not only could the ‘objectivity’ of the German Government be counted 
upon, and thus there need be no fear of protest from that quarter, but one could 
always remind the German-Austrians of the alliance and thus silence those 
who would be sure to object, should the methods employed in the process of 
Slavisation become too drastic. What could the German-Austrians do, when 
the people of the German Reich itself had openly proclaimed their trust and 
confidence in the Habsburg regime? Should they resist and thus be branded 
openly before their kinsfolk in the Reich as traitors to their own national 
interests? 


They, who, for so many decades, had sacrificed so much for the sake of 
their German tradition! 


Once the influence of the Germans in Austria had been wiped out, what 
then would be the value of the alliance? If the Triple Alliance were to be 
advantageous to Germany, was it not a necessary condition that the 
predominance of the German element in Austria should be maintained? 


Or did anyone really believe that Germany could continue to be the ally 
of a Habsburg Empire under the hegemony of the Slays? 


The official attitude of German diplomacy, as well as that of the general 
public, towards internal problems affecting the Austrian nationalities was not 
merely stupid, it was insane. 


147 


On the alliance, as ona solid foundation, they grounded the security and 
future existence of a nation of seventy millions, while, at the same time, they 
allowed their partner to continue his policy of undermining the sole foundation 
of that alliance, methodically and resolutely, from year to year. 


A day must come when nothing but a formal contract with Viennese 
diplomats would be left. The alliance itself, as an effective support, would be 
lost to Germany. As far as concerned Italy, such had been the case from the 
outset. 


If people in Germany had studied history and the psychology of nations a 
little more carefully, not one of them could have believed for a single hour that 
the Quirinal and the Viennese Hofburg could ever stand shoulder to shoulder 
on a common battle-front. 


Italy would have flared up like a volcano if any Italian government had 
dared to send a single Italian soldier to fight for the Habsburg State, for so 
fanatically did the Italians hate that State, that it would have been impossible 
for them to meet on the field of battle, except as enemies. 


More than once in Vienna I have witnessed explosions of the contempt 
and the profound hatred which ‘allied’ the Italians to the Austrian State. 


The crimes which the House of Habsburg had committed against Italian 
freedom and independence in the course of several centuries were too grave to 
be forgiven, even with the best of goodwill, but this goodwill did not exist, 
either among the rank and file of the population or in the government. 


Therefore, for Italy there were only two ways of co-existing with Austria 
alliance or war. By choosing the first, it was possible to prepare leisurely for 
the second. 


Especially since relations between Russia and Austria tended more and 
more towards the arbitration of war, the German policy of alliances was as 
senseless as it was dangerous. Here was a classic instance which 
demonstrated the lack of any broad or logical line of thought. What was the 
reason for forming an alliance at all? It could not have been other than the wish 
to secure the future of the Reich better than would be possible if it were to 
depend exclusively on its own resources. 


But the future of the Reich could not have meant anything else than the 
problem of securing the means of existence of the German people. An answer 


148 


had, therefore, to be found to the following questions. 


What form shall the life of the nation assume in the near future that is to 
say within such a period as we can forecast? And by what means can the 
necessary foundation and security for this development be guaranteed within 
the framework of the general distribution of power among the European 
nations? 


A clear analysis of the principles on which the foreign policy of German 
statecraft was to be based should have led to the following conclusions: 


The annual increase in the population of Germany amounts to almost nine 
hundred thousand, souls. The difficulties of providing for this army of new 
citizens must grow from year to year and must finally lead to a catastrophe, 
unless ways and means are found which will forestall the danger of misery and 
hunger. 


There were four ways of providing against this terrible calamity: 


(1) It was possible to adopt the French example and artificially restrict 
the number of births, thus avoiding an excess of population. 


In certain circumstances, in periods of distress or under bad climatic 
conditions, or if the soil yields too poor a return, Nature herself tends to check 
the increase of population in some countries and among some races, but by a 
method which is quite as ruthless as it is wise. She does not impede the 
procreative faculty as such; but prevents the further existence of the offspring 
by submitting it to such tests and privations that all but the strongest and 
healthiest are forced to retreat into the bosom of the Unknown. 


Whatever survives these hardships has been tested and tried a 
thousandfold, hardened and rendered, fit to continue the process of 
procreation, so that the same process of selection will begin all over again. 


By thus, dealing brutally with the individual and recalling him the very 
moment he shows that he is not fitted for the trials of life, Nature preserves the 
race and the species and raises it to the highest degree of efficiency. 


The decrease in numbers therefore implies an increase in strength as far 
as the individual is concerned, and this eventually means the invigoration of 
the species. 


149 


The case is different when man himself starts the process of numerical 
restriction. Man is not made of the same stuff as Nature; he is ‘human.’ He 
knows better than the ruthless Queen of Wisdom; he does not impede the 
preservation of the individual but prevents procreation itself. 


To the individual who always sees only himself and not the race, this 
line of action seems more humane and just than the opposite way, but 
unfortunately, the consequences are also the reverse. 


By leaving the process of procreation unchecked and by submitting the 
individual to the hardest preparatory tests in life, Nature selects the best from 
an abundance of single elements and stamps them as fit to live and carry on the 
conservation of the species. 


Man restricts the procreative faculty and strives obstinately to keep alive 
at any cost whatever has once been born. 


This correction of the Divine Will seems to him to be wise and humane, 
and he rejoices at having trumped Nature’s card in one game at least and thus 
proved that she is not entirely reliable. 


This little ‘masterpiece’ made by the Almighty does not like to be told 
that, although he has succeeded in limiting numbers, his system leads to 
degeneration in the quality of the individual, for, as soon as the procreative 
faculty is thwarted and the number of births diminished, the natural struggle for 
existence, which allows only healthy and strong individuals to survive; is 
replaced by a sheer craze to ‘save’ feeble, and even diseased, creatures at any 
cost. 


Thus are sown the seeds of a human progeny which will become more 
and more enfeebled from one generation to another, as long as Nature’s will is 
scorned. If this policy is carried out, the final result will always be that such a 
nation will eventually terminate its own existence on this earth; for, though man 
may defy the eternal laws of procreation for a certain period, vengeance will 
follow sooner or later. 


A stronger race will oust that which has grown weak, for the vital urge, 
in its ultimate form, will burst asunder all the absurd chains of this so-called 
humane consideration for the individual and will replace it with the humanity 
of Nature, which wipes out what is weak in order to make room for the strong. 


Any policy which aims at securing the existence of the German nation by 


150 


restricting the birth-rate robs it of its future. 


(2) Asecond solution is that of internal colonisation. This is a proposal 
which is frequently made in our own-time and one hears it lauded a good deal. 
It is a suggestion that is well-meant, but it is misunderstood by most people, so 
that it is the source of more mischief than can be imagined. 


It is certainly true that the productivity of the soil can be increased to a 
certain extent, but only within definite limits and not indefinitely. 


By increasing the productive powers of the soil, it will be possible to 
balance the effect of a surplus birth-rate in Germany for a certain period of 
time, without incurring any danger of famine. But we have to face the fact that 
the general standard of living is rising more quickly than even the birth-rate. 
Our demands as regards food and clothing are growing from year to year and 
are out of all proportion to those of our ancestors of, let us say, a hundred years 
ago. 


It would, therefore, be a mistake to assume that every increase in the 
productive powers of the soil will supply the requisite conditions for an 
increase in the population. That is true up to a certain point only, for at least a 
portion of the increased produce of the soil will be consumed in supplying the 
increased demands caused by the steady rise in the standard of living. 


But even if these demands were to be curtailed to the narrowest limits 
possible, and 1f, at the same time, we were to use all our available energies in 
intensive cultivation, we should here reach a definite limit which is 
conditioned by the inherent nature of the soil itself. 


No matter how industriously we may labour we cannot increase 
agricultural production beyond this limit. Therefore, though we may postpone 
the evil hour of distress for a certain time, it will arrive at last. 


The first phenomenon will be the recurrence of famine periods from time 
to time, after bad harvests, etc. The intervals between these famines will 
become shorter and shorter, the more the population increases, and finally, the 
famine times will disappear only in those rare years of plenty when the 
granaries are full. 


A time, will ultimately come when, even in those years of plenty, there 
will not be enough to go round, so that hunger will dog the footsteps of the 
nation. Nature must now step in once more and select those who are to survive; 


151 


or else man will help himself by artificially preventing his own increase, with 
all the fatal consequences to the race and the species which have already been 
mentioned. 


It may be objected here that, in one form or another, this future is in store 
for all mankind and that the individual nation or race cannot escape the general 
fate. At first glance, that objection seems logical enough; but we have to take 
the following into account. The day will certainly come when the whole of 
mankind will be forced to check the augmentation of the human species, 
because there will be no further possibility of adjusting the productivity of the 
soil to the perpetual increase in the population. 


Nature must then be allowed to use her own methods, or man may 
possibly take the task of regulation into his own hands and establish the 
necessary equilibrium by the application of better means than we have at our 
disposal to-day. 


Then, however, it will be a problem for mankind as a whole, whereas 
now only those races have to suffer from want which no longer have the 
strength and daring to acquire sufficient land to provide for their needs, for, as 
things stand to-day, vast spaces still lie uncultivated all over the surface of the 
globe. 


Those spaces are only waiting for the ploughshare, and it is certain that 
Nature did not set those territories apart as the exclusive property of any one 
nation or race, to be held in reserve for the future. Such land awaits the people 
who have the strength to acquire it and the diligence to cultivate it. 


Nature knows no political frontiers. She begins by establishing life on 
this globe and then watches the free play of forces. Those who show the 
greatest courage and industry are the children nearest to her heart and they will 
be granted the sovereign right of existence. 


If a nation confines itself to ‘internal colonisation’, while other races are 
perpetually increasing their territorial possessions all over the globe, that 
nation will be forced to restrict the numerical growth of its population at a time 
when the other nations are increasing theirs. 


This situation must eventually arise, and it will arise soon if the territory 
which the nation has at its disposal be small. Now, it is unfortunately true that 
only too often the best nations—or, to speak more exactly, the only really 


E52 


cultured nations, who at the same time are the chief champions of human 
progress—have decided, in their blind pacifism, to refrain from the acquisition 
of new territory and to be content with ‘internal colonisation.’ 


At the same time nations of inferior quality succeed in getting hold of 
large areas for colonisation all over the globe. 


The final outcome of this state of affairs will be that races which are 
culturally superior, but less ruthless would be forced to restrict their increase, 
because of insufficient territory to support the population, while less civilised 
races could increase indefinitely, owing to the vast territories at their disposal. 


In other words, should this state of affairs continue, then the world will 
one day be possessed by that portion of mankind which is culturally inferior, 
but more active and energetic. 


A time will come, even though in the distant future, when there can be 
only two alternatives—either the world will be ruled according to our modern 
concept of democracy, and then every decision will be in favour of the 
numerically stronger races; or the world will be governed by the law of natural 
distribution of power, and then those nations will be victorious who are more 
brutal of will and they will not be the nations who have practised self-denial. 


Nobody can doubt that this world will one day be the scene of dreadful 
struggles for existence on the part of mankind. In the end the instinct of self- 
preservation alone will triumph; before its consuming fire this so-called 
humanitarianism, which connotes only a mixture of fatuous timidity and self- 
conceit, will melt away as snow in the March sunshine. 


Man has become great through perpetual struggle. In perpetual peace his 
greatness must decline. 


For us Germans the slogan of ‘internal colonisation’ is fatal, because it 
encourages the belief that we have discovered a means which is in accordance 
with our innate pacifism and which will enable us to work for our livelihood 
by leading a drowsy existence. 


Such a teaching, once it were taken seriously by our people, would mean 
the end of all effort to acquire for ourselves that, place in the world which we 
deserve. 


If the average German were once convinced that by this measure he had 


153 


been given the chance of ensuring his livelihood and guaranteeing his future, 
any attempt to take an active, and thus profitable, part in promoting the vital 
interests of the country would be out of the question. 


Should the nation agree to such an attitude, then any really useful foreign 
policy might be looked upon as dead and buried, together with all hope for the 
future of the German people. 


Once we know what the consequences of this ‘internal colonisation’ 
theory would be, we can no longer consider as a mere accident the fact that, 
among those who inculcate this pernicious theory upon the minds of our 
people, the Jew is always in the; first rank. 


He knows his audience too well not to know that they are ready to be the 
grateful victims of every swindler who promises them a fortune in the shape of 
a discovery that will enable them to outwit Nature and thus render superfluous 
the hard and inexorable struggle for existence so that finally they may become 
lords of the Earth partly by sheer dolce far niente and partly by work, just as it 
happens. 


It cannot be too strongly emphasised that any German ‘internal 
colonisation’ must first of all be considered as suited only for the relief of 
social grievances, and in particular, for freeing the soil from the grip of the 
speculator, but that such a system could never suffice to assure the future of the 
nation, without the acquisition of new territory. 


If we adopt a different plan we shall soon reach a point beyond which 
the resources of our soil can no longer be exploited, and at the same time we 
shall reach a point beyond which our man-power cannot develop. 


In conclusion, it must be emphasised that the two factors, namely, 
limitation to a definitely small area as necessitated by internal colonisation, 
and the restriction of procreation, which leads to the same result, have a very 
unfavourable effect on the military and political standing of a nation. 


The extent of the national territory is a determining factor in the external 
security of the nation. The larger the territory which a people has at its 
disposal, the stronger are the national defences of that people. 


Military victories are more quickly, more easily, more completely and 
more effectively gained against a people occupying a national territory which 
is restricted in area, than against States which have extensive territories. 


154 


Hence, the magnitude of a nation’s territory is in itself a certain 
guarantee that an outside Power will not hastily risk the adventure of an 
invasion, for in that case the struggle would have to be long and exhausting 
before victory could be hoped for. 


The risk being so great, there would have to be extraordinary reasons for 
such an aggressive adventure. Hence it is, that the territorial magnitude of a 
State furnishes a basis whereon national liberty and independence can be 
maintained with relative ease; while, on the contrary, a State whose territory is 
small offers a natural temptation to the invader. 


As a matter of fact, so-called national circles in the German Reich 
rejected these first two possibilities of establishing a balance between the 
constant numerical increase in the population and a national territory which did 
not expand proportionately. 


But the reasons given for that rejection were different from those which I 
have just expounded. It was mainly on the basis of certain moral objections 
that restriction of the birth-rate was condemned. Proposals for internal 
colonisation were rejected indignantly because it was suspected that such a 
policy might mean an attack on the big landowners, and that this attack might be 
the forerunner of a general attack upon the principle of private property as a 
whole. 


The form in which the latter solution-internal colonisation was 
recommended justified these misgivings. Generally speaking, the manner in 
which the rejection of this proposal was carried out was not skilful in respect 
of the effect on the bulk of the people and, in any case, it did not go to the root 
of the problem at all. 


Only two further ways were left open by which work and bread could be 
secured for the increasing population. 


(3) It was possible to think of acquiring new territory on which a certain 
portion of the increasing population could be settled each year, and thus keep 
the nation in the position of being self-supporting. 


(4) Our industry and commerce could have been organised in sucha 
manner as to secure an increase in exports and thus be able to support our 
people by the increased purchasing power accruing from the profits made on 
foreign markets. 


155 


Therefore, the problem was: A policy of territorial expansion or a 
colonial and commercial policy? Both policies were taken into consideration, 
examined, recommended and, rejected, from various standpoints, with the 
result that the second alternative was finally adopted. The sounder alternative, 
however, was undoubtedly the first. 


The principle of acquiring new territory, on which the surplus population 
could be settled, has many advantages to recommend it, especially if we take 
the future, rather than the present, into account. 


In the first place, too much importance cannot be attached to the 
necessity for adopting a policy which will make it possible to maintain a, 
healthy farmer class as the basis of the national community. Many of our 
present evils have their origin exclusively in the disproportion between the 
urban and rural portions of the population. 


A solid stock of small and medium farmers have at all times been the 
best protection which a nation could have against the social diseases that are 
prevalent to-day. Moreover, that is the only solution which guarantees the daily 
bread of a nation within the framework of its domestic national economy. 


With this condition once guaranteed, industry and commerce would retire 
from the unhealthy position of foremost importance which they hold to-day and 
would take their due place within the general scheme of national economy, 
adjusting the balance between demand and supply. 


Thus, industry and commerce would no longer constitute the basis of the 
national subsistence, but would be auxiliary institutions. By fulfilling their 
proper function, which is to adjust the balance between national production 
and national consumption, they render national subsistence more or less 
independent of foreign countries and thus assure the freedom and independence 
of the nation, especially at critical junctures in its history. 


Such a territorial policy, however, cannot be carried out in the 
Cameroons, but, almost exclusively, here in Europe. One must calmly and 
squarely face the truth that it certainly cannot be part of the dispensation of 
Divine Providence to give to onto nation a fifty times larger share of the 
surface of this globe than to another. 


In considering this state of affairs to-day, one must not allow existing 
political frontiers to distract attention from those frontiers which, on the 


156 


principle of eternal justice, ought to exist. 


If there 1s sufficient ‘living space’ for all on this earth, then we ought to 
be given our share of the soil which is absolutely necessary for our existence, 
but of course nobody will be prepared to do so. 


At this point the right of self-preservation comes into effect, and when 
attempts to settle the difficulty in an amicable way are rejected, the clenched 
fist must take by force that which was refused to the open hand of friendship. 
If, in the past, our ancestors had based their political decisions on the same 
pacifist nonsense as our present generation does, we should not possess more 
than one-third of the national territory that we possess to-day and probably 
there would be no German nation to worry about its future in Europe. 


We owe the two eastern provinces of the Reich to the innate 
determination of our forefathers in their struggle for existence, and thus it is to 
the same determined policy that we owe the inner strength which is based on 
the extent of our political and racial territories and which alone has made it 
possible for us to exist up to now. There is still another reason why that 
solution would have been the correct one. Many contemporary European States 
are like pyramids standing on their apexes. The European territory which these 
States possess 1s ridiculously small when compared with the enormous over- 
head weight of their colonies, foreign trade, etc. 


It may be said that they have the apex in Europe and the base of the 
pyramid all over the world very different from the United States of America, 
which has its base on the American Continent and is in contact with the rest of 
the world only through its apex. 


Out of that situation arises the incomparable inner strength of the U.S.A. 
and the contrary situation is responsible for the weakness of most of the 
European colonial Powers. 


Britain cannot be suggested as an argument against this assertion, since 
faced with the British Empire, one is inclined to overlook the existence of the 
Anglo-Saxon world as such. 


Britain’s position cannot be compared with that of any other State in 
Europe, since together with the U.S.A. it forms a vast community of language 
and culture. 


Therefore, the only possibility which Germany had of carrying into effect 


157 


a sound territorial policy of expansion was that of acquiring new territory in 
Europe itself: Colonies cannot serve this purpose as long as they are not suited 
for settlement by Europeans on a large scale. 


In the nineteenth century it was no longer possible to acquire such 
colonies by peaceful means. Therefore, any attempt at such a colonial 
expansion would have meant an enormous military struggle. Consequently, it 
would, have been more practical to undertake that military struggle for new 
territory in Europe, rather than to wage war for the acquisition of possessions 
abroad. 


Such a decision naturally demanded that the nation’s undivided energies 
should be devoted to it. A policy of that kind which requires for its fulfilment 
every ounce of available energy on the part of all concerned, cannot be carried 
into effect by half-measures or in a hesitating manner. 


The political activity of the German Reich should then have been 
directed exclusively towards this goal. No political step should have been 
taken as a result of any other consideration unconnected with this task and the 
means of accomplishing it. 


Germany should have been alive to the fact that such a goal could have 
been reached only by war, and the prospect of war should have been faced 
with calm and collected determination. The whole system of alliances should 
have been envisaged and valued from that standpoint. 


If new territory had to be acquired in Europe it could have been done 
mainly at Russia’s expense, and once again the new German Reich should have 
set out on its march alone the same road as was formerly trodden by the 
Teutonic Knights, in order to acquire soil for the German plough by means of 
the German sword, and thus provide the nation with its daily bread. 


For such a policy, however, there would have been only one possible 
ally in Europe and that was Britain. 


Only by alliance with Britain would it have been possible to safeguard 
the rear of the new German crusade. The justification for undertaking such a 
campaign would have been no less strong than the justification which our 
forefathers had for setting out on theirs. 


Not one of our pacifists refuses to eat the bread made from the grain 
grown in the eastern provinces, and yet the first ploughing there was done by 


158 


the sword. No sacrifice should have been considered too great if it was a 
necessary means of gaining Britain’s friendship. 


Colonial and naval ambitions should have been abandoned and attempts 
should not have been made to compete against British industries. Only a clear 
and definite policy could lead to such an achievement. 


Such a policy would have demanded a renunciation of world trade, 
colonial intentions and naval power. All the means of power at the disposal of 
the State should have been concentrated in the military forces on land. This 
policy would have involved a period of temporary self-denial, for the sake of 
a great and powerful future. 


There was a time when Britain might have entered into negotiations with 
us on the grounds of that proposal, for Britain would have well understood that 
the problems arising from the steady increase in population were forcing 
Germany to look for a solution either in Europe with the help of Britain or, 
without Britain, in some other part of the world. 


This outlook was probably the chief reason why Britain tried to draw 
nearer to Germany about the close of the century. For the first time in Germany 
an attitude was then manifested which afterwards displayed itself in a most 
tragic way. 


People then gave expression to an unpleasant feeling that we might thus 
find ourselves obliged to do Britain’s dirty work as if an alliance could be 
based on anything else than mutual give-and-take! And British diplomats were 
still clever enough to know that an equivalent must be forthcoming in return for 
any services rendered. 


Let us suppose that in 1904, our German foreign policy was managed 
astutely enough to enable us to play the part which Japan played. It is not easy 
to measure the greatness of the results that might have accrued to Germany 
from such a policy. 


There would have been no World War. The blood which would have 
been shed in 1904 would not have been one tenth of that shed between 1914 
and 1918, and what a position Germany would hold in the world to-day! In any 
case, the alliance with Austria would then have been an absurdity, for this 
mummy of a State did not attach itself to Germany for the purpose of carrying 
through a war, but rather to maintain a perpetual state of peace which was 


159 


meant to be exploited for the purpose of slowly but persistently exterminating 
the German element in the Dual Monarchy. 


Another reason for the impossibility of forming this alliance was that 
nobody could expect this State to take an active part in defending German 
national interests, as long as it did not have sufficient strength and 
determination to put an end to the policy of de-Germanisation just beyond its 
own frontiers. 


If Germany was not moved by a sufficiently powerful national sentiment 
and was not sufficiently ruthless to take away from that absurd Habsburg State 
the right to decide the destinies often million inhabitants who were of the same 
nationality as the Germans themselves, surely it was out of the question to 
expect her to engage in any far-sighted and courageous undertaking. 


The attitude of the old Reich towards the Austrian question might have 
been taken as a test of its stamina for the struggle in which the destiny of the 
whole nation was at stake. 


In any case, the policy of oppression against the German population in 
Austria should not have been allowed to go on and to become more 
pronounced year by year, for the value of Austria as an ally depended solely on 
the preservation of the German element in that country. 


That course was not followed. Nothing was, dreaded so much as the 
possibility of an armed conflict; but finally, and at a most unfavourable 
moment, the conflict had to be faced. Germany thought to cut herself loose from 
the cords of Destiny, but Destiny held her fast. She dreamt of maintaining a 
world peace and woke up to find herself in a world war. 


That dream of peace was a most significant reason why the above- 
mentioned third alternative for the future development of Germany was not 
even taken into consideration. The fact was recognised that new territory could 
be gained only in the east of Europe, but this meant that there would be fighting 
ahead, whereas Germany wanted peace at any cost. 


The slogan of German foreign policy had altered from ‘Preservation of 
the German nation at all costs’ to ‘Preservation of world-peace at any price.’ 
We know what the result was. 


I shall resume the discussion of this point in detail later on. There 
remained still another alternative, which we may call the fourth, namely, 


160 


industry and world trade, naval power and colonies. 


Such a development might certainly have been achieved more easily and 
more rapidly. To colonise a territory is a slow process, often extending over 
centuries. Yet this fact is the source of its inner strength; for it 1s not through a 
sudden burst of enthusiasm that it can be put into effect, but rather through a 
gradual and enduring process of growth quite different from industrial 
progress, which can be artificially speeded up within a few years. 


The result thus achieved, however, is not of lasting quality but something 
frail, like a soap-bubble. It is much easier to build a fleet quickly than to carry 
through the tough task of settling a territory with farmers and establishing 
farmsteads, but the former is also more quickly destroyed than the latter. 


In adopting such a course Germany must have known that to follow it out, 
would necessarily mean war sooner or later. Only children could have 
believed that sweet and unctuous expressions of friendship and persistent 
avowals of peaceful intentions could get them their bananas through this 
‘friendly competition between the nations,’ without the prospect of ever having 
to fight for them. 


Once we had taken this road, Britain was bound to be our enemy at some 
time to come. Of course it fitted in nicely with our innocent assumptions, but 
still it was absurd to grow indignant at the fact that a day came when the 
British took the liberty of opposing our peaceful penetration with the brutality 
of violent egotists. Naturally, we, on our side, would never have done such a 
thing. 


If a European territorial policy of expansion against Russia could have 
been put into practice only if we had had Britain as our ally, a colonial and 
world-trade policy on the other hand, could have been carried into effect only 
against British interests and with the support of Russia. 


But then this policy should have been adopted in full consciousness of 
all the consequences it involved and, above all things, Austria should have 
been discarded as quickly as possible. 


At the close of the century the alliance with Austria had become a 
veritable absurdity from all points of view, but nobody thought of forming an 
alliance with Russia against Britain, just as nobody thought of making Britain 
an ally against Russia, for in either case, the final result would inevitably have 


161 


been war, and to avoid war was the very reason why a commercial and 
industrial policy was decided upon. 


It was believed that the peaceful conquest of the world by commercial 
means provided a method which would permanently supplant the policy of, 
force. 


Occasionally, however, there were doubts about the efficacy of this 
principle, especially when some quite incomprehensible warnings were now 
and again uttered by Britain. That was the reason why the fleet was built. It 
was not for the purpose of attacking or annihilating Britain, but merely to 
defend the concept of world peace, mentioned above, and also to defend the 
principle of conquering the world by ‘peaceful’ means. 


Therefore this fleet was kept within such limits as made it inferior to the 
British fleet, not only as regards the number and tonnage of the vessels, but 
also in regard to their armament, the idea being to furnish new proofs of 
peaceful intentions. 


The chatter about the peaceful conquest of the world by commercial 
means was probably the most completely nonsensical stuff ever raised to the 
dignity of a guiding principle in the policy of a State. 


This nonsense became even more foolish when Britain was pointed out 
as a typical example to prove how the thing could be done. Our intellectual 
attitude towards history and our professorial ideas in that domain have done 
irreparable harm and offer a striking proof of how people ‘learn’ history 
without understanding anything of it. 


As a matter of fact. Britain ought to have been looked upon as a 
convincing argument against the theory of pacific conquest of the world by 
commercial means. No nation prepared the way for its commercial conquests 
more brutally than Britain did by means of the sword and no other nation has 
defended such conquests more ruthlessly. 


Is it not a characteristic quality of British statecraft that 1t knows how to 
use political power in order to gain economic advantages and, inversely, to 
turn economic conquests into political power? 


What an astounding error it was to believe that Britain would not have 
the courage to shed her own blood for the purpose of economic expansion! The 
fact that Britain did not possess a national army proved nothing, for it is not the 


162 


actual military structure of the moment that matters, but rather the will and 
determination to use whatever military strength 1s available. 


Britain has always had the armament which she needed. She always 
fought with those weapons which were necessary for success. She sent 
mercenary troops to fight as long as mercenaries, sufficed, but she never 
hesitated to draw heavily and deeply on the best blood of the whole nation 
when victory could be obtained only by such a sacrifice, and in every case the 
fighting spirit, dogged determination, and use of brutal means in conducting 
military operations have always remained the same. 


But in Germany, through the medium of the schools, the press and the 
comic papers, there was gradually formed an idea of the Englishman and, to a 
greater degree, of his Empire, which was bound eventually to lead to the worst 
kind of self-deception. 


This absurdity slowly, but persistently, spread to every section of the 
German nation. The result was an undervaluation for which we have had to pay 
a heavy penalty. 


The delusion was so profound that the Englishman was looked upon as a 
shrewd business man, but at the same time, as a physical coward. 
Unfortunately, our sagacious teachers of history did not realise that it is not 
possible to build up such a mighty organisation as the British Empire by mere 
swindle and fraud. The few who called attention to that truth were either 
ignored or silenced. I can call vividly to mind the astonished looks of my 
comrades when they found themselves for the first time face to face with the 
Tommies in Flanders. After a few days of fighting the consciousness slowly 
dawned on our soldiers that those Scotsmen were not like the ones we had 
seen described and caricatured in the comic papers and mentioned in the 
communiques. 


It was then that I formed my first ideas on the efficiency of various forms 
of propaganda. 


Such a falsification, however, served the purpose of those who were 
responsible for it. This caricature of the Englishman, though false, could be 
used to prove the possibility of conquering the world, peacefully by 
commercial means. 


Where the Englishman had succeeded we should also succeed. Our far 


163 


greater honesty and our freedom from that specifically English ‘perfidy’ would 
be assets on our side. Thereby it was hoped that the sympathy of the smaller 
nations and the confidence of the greater nations could be gained more easily. 


Because we ourselves believed in it, we did not realise that our honesty 
was an object of profound aversion to other people. The rest of the world 
looked on our behaviour as the manifestation of a shrewd deceitfulness and it 
was not until the revolution came, that they were amazed at the deeper insight it 
gave them into our mentality, sincere even beyond the limits of stupidity. 


Once we understand the part played by that absurd notion of conquering 
the world by peaceful commercial means, we can clearly understand how that 
other absurdity, the Triple Alliance, came to exist. With what State then could 
an alliance have been made? 


In alliance with Austria we could not acquire new territory by military 
means, even in Europe, and this very fact was the real reason for the inner 
weakness of the Triple Alliance. A Bismarck could permit himself such a 
makeshift, but certainly not any of his bungling successors, least of all when the 
foundations no longer existed on which lie had formed the Triple Alliance. 


In Bismarck’s time Austria could still be looked upon as a German State 
but the gradual introduction of universal suffrage turned, the country into a 
parliamentary Babel in which the German voice was scarcely audible. 


From the point of view of racial policy, this alliance with Austria was 
simply disastrous. A new Slav Great Power was allowed to grow up close to 
the frontiers of the German Reich. 


Later on this Power was bound to adopt towards Germany an attitude 
different from that of Russia, for example. The alliance was thus bound to 
become more empty and more feeble, because its only supporters were losing 
their influence and were being systematically pushed out of the more important 
public offices. 


About the year 1900, the alliance with Austria had already entered upon 
the same phase as the alliance between Austria and Italy. 


Here also only two alternatives were possible—either to take the side of 
the Habsburg Monarchy or to raise a protest against the oppression of the 
German element in Austria. But, generally speaking, when one adopts such a 
course it is bound eventually to lead to open conflict. 


164 


From the psychological point of view also, the value of the Triple 
Alliance was slight, since the soundness of an alliance diminishes in the same 
ratio in which its object is limited to the defence of the status quo. 


On the other hand, an alliance will increase in strength the more the 
parties concerned in it may hope to use it as a means of reaching some 
practical goal of expansion. Here, as everywhere else, strength lies not in 
defence, but in attack. 


This truth was recognised in various quarters but, unfortunately, not by 
those called upon to rule the people. As early as 1912, Ludendorff, who was 
then colonel and attached to the General Staff, pointed out these weak features 
of the alliance in a memorandum, but of course the ‘statesmen’ did not attach 
any importance or value to that document. 


In general it would seem as if common sense were a faculty that is 
present only in the case of ordinary mortals but is entirely absent when we 
come to deal with that branch of the species known as ‘diplomats.’ 


It was lucky for Germany that the war of 1914 broke out with Austria as 
its direct cause, for thus the Habsburgs were compelled to participate. Had the 
situation been reversed, Germany would have been left to her own resources. 
The Habsburg State would never have been ready or willing to take part ina 
war, for the outbreak of which Germany was responsible. 


What was the object of so much oblogquy later in the case of Italy, would 
have taken place, only earlier, in the case of Austria. 


In other words, if Germany had been forced to go to war for some reason 
of her own, Austria would have remained ‘neutral’ in order to safeguard the 
State against a revolution which might have begun immediately after the war 
had started. 


The Slav element would have preferred to smash up the Dual Monarchy 
in 1914 rather than permit it to come to the assistance of Germany, but at that 
time there were only a few who understood all the dangers and difficulties 
which resulted from the alliance with the Danubian Monarchy. 


In the first place, Austria had too many enemies who were eagerly 
looking forward to obtaining the heritage of that decrepit State and who 
gradually developed a certain animosity against Germany, because Germany 
was an obstacle to their desires inasmuch as she kept the Dual Monarchy from 


165 


falling to pieces, an event that was hoped for on all sides. The conviction 
developed that Vienna could be reached only via Berlin. 


In the second place, by adopting this policy Germany lost her best and 
most promising chances of other alliances. In place of these possibilities one 
now observed a growing tension in her relations with Russia and even with 
Italy, and this in spite of the fact that the general attitude in Rome was just as 
favourable to Germany as it was hostile to Austria—a hostility which lay 
dormant in the individual Italian and broke out violently on occasion. 


Since a commercial and industrial policy had been adopted, no motive 
was left for waging war against Russia. Only the enemies of the two countries, 
Germany and Russia, could, in these circumstances, have an active interest in 
such a war. As a matter of fact, it was only the Jews and the Marxists who 
tried to stir up bad blood between the two States. 


In the third place, the alliance constituted a permanent danger to German 
security, for any Great Power that was hostile to Bismarck’s Reich could 
mobilise a number of other States in a war against Germany by promising them 
tempting spoils at the expense of the Austrian ally. 


It was possible to arouse the whole of Eastern Europe against Austria, 
especially Russia and Italy. The world coalition which had developed under 
the leadership of King Edward could never have become a reality if 
Germany’s ally, Austria, had not offered such an alluring prospect of booty. 


It was this fact alone which made it possible to combine so many 
heterogeneous States with divergent interests into one common phalanx of 
attack. Every member could hope to enrich himself at the expense of Austria, if 
he joined in the general attack against Germany. 


The fact that Turkey was also a tacit party to the unfortunate alliance 
with Austria augmented Germany’s peril to an extraordinary degree. 


Jewish international finance needed the bait of the Austrian heritage in 
order to carry out its plans of ruining Germany, for Germany had not yet 
surrendered to their general and international control in the sphere of trade and 
finance. 


Thus it was possible to consolidate that coalition and make it strong 
enough and brave enough, through sheer weight of numbers, to join in a conflict 
with the ‘horned’ Siegfried. 


166 


The alliance with the Habsburg Monarchy, which I loathed while still in 
Austria, was the subject of grave concern on my part and caused me to 
meditate on it so persistently that I was confirmed in the opinions which I had 
previously formed. 


Among the few people with whom I consorted at that time I did not 
conceal my conviction that this sinister agreement with a State doomed to 
collapse would also bring catastrophe to Germany if she did not free herself in 
time. 


I never for a moment wavered in that firm conviction, even when the 
tempest of the World War seemed to have made shipwreck of the reasoning 
faculty itself and had put blind enthusiasm in its place, even among those 
circles where the coolest and hardest objective thinking ought to have held 
sway. 


In the trenches, I voiced and upheld my own opinion whenever these 
problems came under discussion. I held that to abandon the Habsburg 
Monarchy would involve no sacrifice, if Germany could thereby reduce the 
number of her own enemies, for the millions of Germans who had donned the 
steel helmet had done so, not in order to fight for the maintenance of corrupt 
dynasty, but rather for the salvation of the German people. 


Before the War there were occasions on which it seemed that at least one 
section of the German public had some slight misgivings about the political 
wisdom of the alliance with Austria. From time to time German conservative 
circles issued warnings against being over-confident about the worth of that 
alliance; but, like every other sensible suggestion made at that time, it was 
thrown to the winds. 


The general conviction was that the right measures had been adopted to 
‘conquer’ the world, that the success of these measures would be enormous 
and the sacrifices negligible. 


Once again the ‘uninitiated’ layman could do nothing but look on while 
the ‘elect’ headed straight for disaster enticing their beloved people to follow 
them, as the rats followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin. 


If we would look for the deeper grounds which made it possible to foist 
on the people this absurd notion of peacefully conquering the world through 
commercial penetration, and ask how it was possible to put forward the 


167 


maintenance of world-peace as a national aim, we shall find that these grounds 
lay in the general morbid condition of German political thought. 


The triumphant progress of technical science in Germany and the 
marvellous development of German industry and commerce led us to forget 
that a powerful State had been the necessary prerequisite of that success. 


On the contrary, certain circles even went so far as to give vent to the 
theory that the State owed its very existence to these phenomena; that it was, 
above all, an economic institution and should be constituted in accordance 
with economic interests. 


Therefore, it was held, the State was dependent on the economic 
structure. This condition of things was looked upon and glorified as the 
soundest and most normal. 


Now, the truth is that the State in itself has nothing whatsoever to do with 
a definite economic concept or a definite economic development. It does not 
arise from a compact made between contracting parties, within a certain 
delimited territory, for the purpose of serving economic ends. 


The State is a community of living beings who have kindred physical and 
spiritual natures, organised for the purpose of ensuring the conservation of 
their own kind and fulfilling those ends which Providence has assigned to that 
particular race or racial branch. 


Therein, and therein alone, lies the purpose and meaning of a State. 
Economic activity is one of the many auxiliary means which are necessary for 
the attainment of those aims. But economic activity is never the origin or 
purpose of a State, except where a State has, from the outset, been founded on 
a false and unnatural basis. 


This alone explains why a State as such does not necessarily need a 
certain delimited territory as a condition of its foundation. This condition 
becomes a necessary prerequisite only among those people who would 
provide and assure subsistence for their kinsfolk through their own industry, 
which means that they are ready to carry on the struggle for existence by means 
of their own work. 


People who can sneak their way, like parasites, into the bosom of other 
nations, and make others work for them on various pretences, can form a State 
without possessing any definite delimited territory. 


168 


This is chiefly applicable to that parasitic race which, particularly at the 
present time, preys upon the honest portion of mankind; I mean the Jews. 


The Jewish State has never been delimited in space. It has been spread 
all over the world, without any frontiers whatsoever, and has always been 
constituted from the membership of one race exclusively. 


That is why the Jews have always formed a State within the State. One 
of the most ingenious tricks ever devised has been that of sailing the Jewish 
ship of state under the flag of religion and thus securing that tolerance which 
Aryans are always ready to grant to different religious faiths. 


The Mosaic Law is really nothing else than the doctrine of the 
preservation of the Jewish race and, therefore, includes all spheres of 
sociological, political and economic science which have a bearing on the main 
end in view. 


The instinct for the preservation of one’s own species is the primary 
cause that leads to the formation of human communities. Hence, the State is a 
racial organism, and not an economic organisation. 


The difference between the two is so great as to be incomprehensible to 
our contemporary so-called ‘statesmen.’ 


That is why they like to believe that the State can be built up on an 
economic basis, whereas the truth 1s that it has always resulted from the 
exercise of those qualities which are part of the will to preserve the species 
end the race. 


These qualities always exist and operate through the heroic virtues and 
have nothing to do with commercial egotism, for the conservation of the 
species always presupposes that the individual is ready to sacrifice himself. 
Such is the meaning of the poet’s lines: 


Und setzet ihr nicht das Leben ein, Nie wird euch das Leben 
gewonnen sein.(And if you do not stake your life, You will never win life for 
yourself.) 


The sacrifice of the individual existence is necessary in order to assure 
the conservation of the race. Hence it is that the most essential condition for the 
establishment and maintenance of a State is a certain feeling of solidarity, 
grounded in an identity of character and race and in a readiness to defend these 


169 


at all costs. 


With people who live on their own territory this will result ina 
development of the heroic virtues; with a parasitic people it will develop into 
hypocrisy and perfidious cruelty, unless we admit that these characteristics are 
innate and that the varying political forms through which the parasitic race 
expresses itself are only the outward manifestation of innate characteristics. 


At least in the beginning, the formation of a State can result only froma 
manifestation of the heroic qualities I have mentioned, and the people who fail 
in the struggle for existence, that is to say, those who become vassals and are 
thereby condemned to disappear entirely sooner or later, are those who do not 
display the heroic virtues in the struggle, or those who fall victims to the, 
perfidy of the parasites. 


Even in this latter case the failure 1s not so much due to lack of 
intellectual powers, but rather to a lack of courage and determination, which 
attempts to disguise itself as humane feeling. 


The qualities which are employed for the foundation and preservation of 
a State have accordingly little or nothing to do with trade and industry, and this 
is conspicuously demonstrated by the fact that the inner strength of a State only 
very rarely coincides with what is called its economic expansion. 


On the contrary, there are numerous examples to show that a period of 
economic prosperity indicates the approaching decline of a State. If it were 
correct to attribute the foundation of human communities to economic forces, 
then the power of the State as such would be at its highest pitch during periods 
of economic prosperity, and not vice versa. 


It is especially difficult to understand how the belief that the State is 
brought into being and preserved by economic forces could gain currency in a 
country which has given proof of the opposite in every phase of its history. 


The history of Prussia shows, with particular clarity and distinctness, 
that it is as a result of the moral, virtues of the people and not of their 
economic circumstances, that a State is formed. It is only under the protection 
of those virtues that economic activities can be developed and the latter will 
continue to flourish until a time comes when the creative political capacity 
declines. 


Thereupon the economic structure will also break down, a phenomenon 


170 


which is now happening in an alarming manner before our eyes. The material 
interests of mankind can prosper only in the shade of the heroic virtues; the 
moment they become the primary considerations of life they wreck the basis of 
their own existence. 


Whenever the political power of Germany was especially strong the 
economic situation also improved, but whenever economic interests alone 
occupied the foremost place in the life of the people, and thrust ideals into the 
background, the State collapsed and economic ruin soon followed. 


If we consider the question of what those forces actually are which are 
necessary for the creation and preservation of a State, we can sum them up in 
the phrase, ‘the capacity and readiness of the individual to sacrifice himself for 
the common welfare.’ 


That these qualities have nothing at all to do with economics can be 
proved by referring to the simple fact that man does not sacrifice himself for 
material interests. In other words, he will die for an ideal, but not for a 
business. 


The marvellous gift of public psychology which the English possess was 
never better shown than in the way in which they presented their case in the 
World War. We were fighting for our bread; but the English declared that they 
were fighting for ‘freedom,’ and not even for their own freedom, but for the 
freedom of the small nations. 


German people laughed at that piece of effrontery and were angered by 
it, but in doing so they showed how political thought had declined among our 
so-called diplomats in Germany, even before the War. These diplomatists did 
not have the slightest notion of that force which makes men face death of their 
own free will and determination. 


As long as the German people continued to believe that they were 
fighting for ideals in the War of 1914, they stood firm. As soon as they were 
told that they were fighting only for their daily bread they began to give up the 
struggle. 


Our clever ‘statesmen’ were greatly amazed at this change of feeling. 
They never understood that as soon as man is called upon to struggle for purely 
material causes he will avoid death as best he can, for death and the enjoyment 
of the material fruits of a victory are quite incompatible concepts. 


171 


The frailest woman will become a heroine when the life of her own 
child is at stake, and only the will to save their race and native land or the 
State, which offers protection to their race, has, throughout the ages, been the 
urge which has forced men to face the weapons of their enemies. 


The following may be proclaimed as a truth that always holds good: A 
State has never arisen from commercial causes for the purpose of peacefully 
serving commercial ends. States have always arisen from the instinct to 
maintain the racial group, whether this instinct manifest itself in the heroic 
sphere or in the sphere of cunning and chicanery. 


In the first instance we have the Aryan States, based on the principle of 
work and cultural development; in the second, we have the Jewish parasitic 
colonies. As soon as economic interests begin to predominate over the racial 
and cultural instincts of a people or a State, these economic interests become 
the disintegrating cause that leads to subjugation and oppression. 


The belief, which prevailed in Germany before the War, that the world 
could be opened up and even conquered for Germany through a system of 
peaceful commercial penetration and a colonial policy, was a typical symptom 
which indicated the decline of those real qualities whereby States are created 
and preserved, and indicated also the decline of that insight, will-power and 
practical determination which go with those qualities. 


The World War, with its consequences, was the natural outcome of that 
decline. 


To anyone who had not thought over the matter deeply, this attitude of the 
German people—which was quite general—must have seemed an insoluble 
enigma. After all, Germany herself was a magnificent example of an empire 
that had been built up purely by a policy of power. 


Prussia, which was the generative cell of the German Reich, had been 
created by brilliant heroic deeds and not by a financial or commercial 
compact, and the Reich itself was but the magnificent recompense for a 
leadership that had been conducted on a policy of power and military valour. 


How then did it happen that the political instincts of this very same 
German people became so degenerate? It was not merely one isolated 
phenomenon which pointed to this decadence, but morbid symptoms which 
appeared in alarming numbers, now all over the body politic, or eating into the 


f72 


body of the nation, like a gangrenous ulcer. 


It seemed as if some all-pervading poisonous fluid had been injected by 
some mysterious hand into the bloodstream of this once heroic body, bringing 
about a creeping paralysis that affected the reason and the elementary instinct 
of self-preservation. 


During the years 1912—1914, I used to ponder perpetually on those 
problems which related to the policy of the Triple Alliance and the economic 
policy then being pursued by the German Reich. 


Once again I came to the conclusion that the only explanation of this 
enigma lay in the operation of that force with which I had already become 
acquainted in Vienna, though from a different angle. The force to which I refer 
was the Marxist teaching and Weltanschauung and its organised action 
throughout the nation. 


For the second time in my life I plunged deep into the study of that 
destructive teaching. This time, however, I was not urged to the study of the 
question by the impressions and influences of my daily environment, but 
directed rather by the observation of general phenomena in the political life of 
Germany. 


In delving again into the theoretical literature of this new world and 
endeavouring to get a clear view of the possible consequences of its teaching, I 
compared ,the theoretical principles of Marxism with the phenomena and 
happenings brought about by its activities in the political, cultural, and 
economic spheres. 


For the first time in my life I now turned my attention to the efforts that 
were being made to subdue this universal pest. I studied Bismarck’s 
exceptional legislation, in its original concept, its operation and its results. 
Gradually I formed a basis for my own opinions, which has proved as solid as 
a rock, so that ever since have I had to change my attitude towards the general 
problem. 


I also made a further and more thorough analysis of the relations between 
Marxism and Jewry. 


During my sojourn in Vienna I used to look upon Germany as an 
imperturbable colossus, but now serious doubts and misgivings often assailed 
me. In my own mind and in my conversation with my small circle of 


173 


acquaintances I used to criticise Germany’s foreign policy and the incredibly 
superficial way, according to my thinking, in which Marxism was dealt with, 
though it was then the most important problem in Germany. 


I could not understand how Germany could stumble blindfold into the 
midst of this peril, the effects of which would be momentous if the openly 
declared aims of Marxism could be put into practice. Even as early as that time 
I warned people around me, just as I am warning a wider audience now, 
against that soothing slogan of all indolent and cowardly natures: Nothing can 
happen to us. 


A similar mental contagion had already destroyed a mighty empire. Can 
Germany escape the operation of those laws to which all other human 
communities are subject? 


In the years 1913 and 1914, I expressed my opinion for the first time in 
various circles, some of which are now supporters of the National Socialist 
Movement, that the problem of how the future of the German nation can be 
secured is the problem of how Marxism can be exterminated. 


I considered the disastrous German policy of alliances as one of the 
consequences resulting from the disintegrating effects of the Marxist teaching, 
for the alarming feature was that this teaching was invisibly corrupting the 
foundations of a healthy political and economic outlook. Those who had been 
themselves contaminated frequently did not realise that their aims and actions 
sprang from this Weltanschauung, which they otherwise openly repudiated. 


Long before then, the spiritual and moral decline of the German people 
had set in, though those who were affected by this morbid decadence were 
frequently unaware—as often happens—of the forces which were breaking up 
their very existence. 


Sometimes they tried to cure the disease by ‘doctoring’ the symptoms, 
which were taken as the cause, but since nobody recognised or wanted to 
recognise the real cause of the disease, this way of combating Marxism was no 
more effective than the application of some quack’s ointment.

CHAPTER V: THE WORLD WAR 


During the boisterous years of my youth, nothing used to damp my wild 
spirits so much as to think that I was born at a time when the world had 
manifestly decided not to erect any more temples of fame except in honour of 
business people and government officials. 


The tempest of historical achievements seemed to have permanently 
subsided, so much so, that the future appeared to be irrevocably delivered over 
to what was called peaceful competition between the nations. This simply 
meant a system of mutual exploitation by fraudulent means, the principle of 
resorting to the use of force in self-defence being formally excluded. 


Individual countries increasingly assumed the appearance of commercial 
undertakings, grabbing territory, clients and concessions from each other under 
any and every kind of pretext, and it was all carried out to the accompaniment 
of loud but innocuous shouting. 


This trend of affairs seemed destined to develop steadily and 
permanently. Having the support of public approbation, it seemed bound 
eventually to transform the world into a mammoth department store. In the 
vestibule of this emporium there would be rows of monumental busts which 
would confer immortality on those profiteers who had proved themselves the 
shrewdest at their trade and those administrative officials who had shown 
themselves the most innocuous. 


The salesmen could be represented by the English and the administrative 
functionaries by the Germans; whereas the Jews would have to sacrifice 
themselves and be content with the unprofitable calling, of proprietorship, for 
they are constantly avowing that they make no profits and are always being 
called upon to ‘pay out.’ 


Moreover, they have the advantage of being versed in foreign languages. 


Why could I not have been born a hundred years ago, I used to ask 
myself, somewhere about the time of the Wars of Liberation, when a man was 
still of some value even though he had no ‘business?’ Thus I used to think it an 
ill-deserved stroke of bad luck that I had arrived too late on this terrestrial 
globe and I felt chagrined at the idea that my life would have to run its course 
along peaceful and orderly lines. 


177 


As a boy I was anything but a pacifist and all attempts to make me so 
turned out futile. 


Then the Boer War came, like a flash of lightning on the far horizon. Day 
after day, I used to gaze intently at the newspapers and I almost ‘devoured’ the 
telegrams and communiques, overjoyed to think that I could witness that heroic 
struggle, even though from so great a distance. 


When the Russo-Japanese War came, I was older and better able to 
judge for myself. For national reasons | then took the side of the Japanese in 
our discussions and I looked upon the defeat of the Russians as a blow to 
Austrian Slavism. 


Many years had passed between that time and my arrival in Munich. I 
now realised that what I formerly believed to be a morbid decadence was only 
the lull before the storm. During my Vienna days, the Balkans were already in 
the grip of that sultry pause which presages the violent storm. Here and there, a 
flash of lightning could be seen occasionally, but it rapidly disappeared in 
sinister gloom. 


Then the Balkan War broke out, and with it, the first gusts of the coming 
tornado swept across a highly strung Europe. In the supervening calm men felt 
the atmosphere oppressive with foreboding, so much so that the sense of an 
impending catastrophe became transformed into a feeling of impatient 
expectancy. 


They wished that Heaven would give free rein to the fate which could 
now no longer be curbed. Then the first great bolt of lightning struck the earth. 
The storm broke and the thunder of the heavens intermingled with the roar of 
the cannons in the World War. 


When the news came to Munich that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand had 
been murdered, I had been at home all day and did not learn the particulars of 
how it happened. At first, I feared that the shots had been fired by some 
German- Austrian students who had been aroused to a state of furious 
indignation by the persistent pro-Slav activities of the heir to the Habsburg 
throne and therefore wished to liberate the German population from this 
internal enemy. 


It was quite easy to imagine what the result of such a mistake would have 
been. It would have brought on, a new wave of persecution, the motives of 


178 


which would have been ‘justified’ before the whole world, but soon 
afterwards I heard the names of the presumed assassins and learned also that 
they were known to be Serbs. 


I felt somewhat dumbfounded in face of the inexorable vengeance which 
Destiny had wrought. The greatest friend of the Slavs had fallen a victim to the 
bullets of Slav patriots. 


Anyone who was ina position to observe attentively the reactions 
between Austria and Serbia during those latter years must surely have realised 
that something had been set in motion which could no longer be checked. It 1s 
unjust to the Austrian Government of that time to blame it now for the form and 
tenor of the ultimatum which was then presented. In a similar position and in 
similar circumstances, no other Power in the world would have acted 
otherwise. 


On her southern frontiers Austria had a relentless mortal foe who 
indulged in acts of provocation against the Dual Monarchy at intervals which 
were becoming more and more frequent. This persistent line of conduct would 
not have been relaxed until the arrival of the opportune moment for the 
destruction of the Empire. 


In Austria there was good reason to fear that, at the latest, this moment 
would come with the death of the old Emperor. Once that had taken place, it 
was quite possible that the Monarchy would not be able to offer any serious 
resistance. For some years past, the State had been so completely identified 
with the personality of Franz Joseph that, in the eyes of the great mass of the 
people, the death of this venerable personification of the Empire would be 
tantamount to the death of the Empire itself. 


Indeed, it was one of the clever artifices of Slav policy to foster the 
impression that the Austrian State owed its very existence exclusively to the 
extraordinary and rare talents of that monarch. This kind of flattery was 
particularly welcome, at the Hofburg, all the more so, because it had no 
relation whatever to the services actually rendered by the Emperor. 


No effort whatsoever was made to locate the carefully prepared sting 
which lay hidden in this glorifying praise. One fact which was entirely 
overlooked, perhaps intentionally, was that the more the Empire remained 
dependent on the so-called administrative talent of ‘the wisest monarch of all 
times,’ the more catastrophic would be the situation when Death came to knock 


179 


at the door and demand its tribute. 


Was it possible even to imagine the Austrian Empire without its 
venerable ruler? Would not the tragedy which befell Maria Theresia be 
repeated at once? 


It is unjust to governmental circles in Vienna to reproach them with 
having instigated a war which might have been prevented. The war was bound 
to come. Perhaps it might have been postponed for a year or two at the most, 
but it had always been the misfortune of German as well as of Austrian 
diplomats that they endeavoured to put off the inevitable day of reckoning, with 
the result, that they were finally compelled to deliver their blow at a most 
inopportune moment. 


There is every reason to believe that another attempt to preserve peace 
would only have served to postpone the war until an even more unpropitious 
moment. 


Those who did not wish this war ought to have had the courage to take 
the consequences of the refusal upon themselves. Those consequences must 
necessarily have meant the sacrifice of Austria, and even then war would have 
come not as a war in which all the nations were banded together against us, but 
in the form of a dismemberment of the Habsburg Monarchy. 


In that case we should have had to decide whether we should come to the 
assistance of the Habsburgs or stand aside as spectators, with our arms folded, 
and thus allow fate to run its course. 


Those who are loudest in their imprecations to-day and make a great 
parade of wisdom in judging the causes of the war are the very people whose 
activities were the most fatal factor in steering us into the war. 


For several decades previously the German Social Democrats had been 
agitating in an underhand and knavish way for war against Russia, whereas the 
German Centre Party, with, religious ends in view, had worked to make the 
Austrian State the chief centre and turning-point of German policy. 


The consequences of this folly had now to be borne. What came was 
bound to come and in no circumstances could it have been avoided. The fault 
of the German Government lay in the fact that, merely for the sake of 
preserving peace at all costs, they continued to miss the occasions that were 
favourable for action, got entangled in an alliance for the purpose of 


180 


preserving the peace of the world, and thus finally became the victim of a 
world coalition which opposed the German effort for the maintenance of peace 
and was determined to bring about the World War. 


Had the Austrian Government of that time formulated its ultimatum in 
less drastic terms, that would not have altered the situation at all, except 
inasmuch as they themselves might have become the victims of public 
indignation, for, in the eyes of the great masses, the ultimatum was toe 
moderate and certainly not excessive or brutal. Those who would deny this to- 
day are either simpletons with feeble memories or else deliberate falsehood- 
mongers. 


The war of 1914 was certainly not forced on the masses; it was even 
desired by the whole people. There was a desire to bring the general feeling of 
uncertainty to an end once and for all. And it is only in the light of this fact that 
we can understand how more than two million German men and youths 
voluntarily joined the colours, ready to shed the last drop, of their blood for 
the cause. 


For me those hours came as a deliverance from the distress that had 
weighed upon me during the days of my youth. 


I am not ashamed to acknowledge to-day that I was carried away by the 
enthusiasm of the moment and that I sank down upon my knees and thanked 
Heaven out of the fullness of my heart for the favour of having been permitted 
to live in such a time. 


The fight for freedom had broken out ona scale unparalleled in the 
history of the world. From the moment that Fate took the helm in hand, the 
conviction grew among the masses of the people that now it was not a question 
of deciding the destinies of Austria or Serbia, but that the very existence of the 
German nation itself was at stake. 


For the last time, during many years of blindness, the people saw clearly 
into the future. Therefore, almost immediately after the gigantic struggle had 
begun, an excessive enthusiasm was replaced by a more earnest and more 
fitting undertone, because the exaltation of the popular spirit was not a mere 


passing frenzy. 


It was only too necessary that the gravity of the situation should be 
recognised. At that time, there was, generally speaking, not the slightest 


181 


presentiment or conception of how long the war might last. 


People dreamed of the soldiers being home by Christmas and that then 
they would resume their daily work in peace. 


Whatever mankind desires, that it will hope for and believe in. The 
overwhelming majority of the people had long since grown weary of the 
perpetual insecurity in the general condition of public affairs. Hence, it was 
only natural that no one believed that the Austro-Serbian conflict could be 
shelved. 


Therefore, they looked forward to a radical settlement of accounts. I also 
belonged to the millions that desired this. The moment the, news of the 
Sarajevo outrage reached Munich two ideas came into my mind: First, that war 
was absolutely inevitable and, second, that the Habsburg State would now be 
forced to honour its signature to the Alliance, for what I had feared most was 
that one day Germany herself, perhaps as a result of the Alliance, would 
become involved in a conflict the direct cause of which was not Austria. 


In such a contingency, I feared that the Austrian State, for domestic 
political reasons, would find itself unable to decide in favour of its ally. The 
pro-Slav majority within the country would have immediately set to work to 
destroy any such intention and would rather have had the entire State go to rack 
and ruin than lend its ally the necessary assistance. 


But now this danger was removed. The old State was compelled to fight, 
whether it wished to do so or not. 


My own attitude towards the conflict was equally simple and clear. I 
believed that it was not a case of Austria fighting to get satisfaction from 
Serbia, but rather a case of Germany fighting for her own existence—the 
German nation for its own ‘to be’ or ‘not to be,’ for its freedom and for its 
future. 


The work of Bismarck must now be carried on. Young Germany must 
show herself worthy of the blood shed by our fathers on so many heroic fields 
of battle, from Weissenburg to Sedan and Paris, and if this struggle should 
bring us victory, our people would again rank foremost among the great 
nations. 


Only then could the German Reich assert itself as the mighty champion of 
peace, without the necessity of restricting the daily bread of its children for the 


182 


sake of maintaining that peace. 


As a boy and as a young man, I often longed for the occasion to prove 
that my national enthusiasm was not mere vapouring. Hurrahing sometimes 
seemed to me to be a kind of sin, since I had not yet by my own actions earned 
the right to do so, for, after all, who has the right to shout that triumphant cry if 
he has not won that right where there is no play-acting and where the hand of 
the goddess of Destiny puts the truth and sincerity of nations and men to her 
inexorable test? 


Just as millions of others, I felt a proud joy in being permitted to go 
through this test. I had so often sung Deutschland uber Alles and so often 
roared ‘Heil’ that, I now thought it a kind of retrospective grace that I was 
granted the right of appearing before the court of eternal justice to testify to the 
truth of those sentiments. 


One thing was clear to me from the very beginning, namely, that in the 
event of war, which now seemed inevitable, my books would have to be 
thrown aside forthwith. I also realised that my place would have to be where 
the inner voice of conscience called me. 


I had left Austria principally for political reasons. What, therefore, could 
be more natural than that I should put my political opinions into practice, now 
that the war had begun. I had no desire to fight for the Habsburg cause, but I 
was prepared to die at any time for my own kinsfolk and the Reich to which 
they really belonged. 


On August 3rd, 1914, I presented an urgent petition to His Majesty, King 
Ludwig III, requesting to be allowed to serve in a Bavarian regiment. In those 
days the Chancellery had its hands full and, therefore, I was all the more 
pleased when a day later I received the answer to my request. 


I opened the document with trembling hands, and no words of mine could 
now describe the satisfaction I felt on reading that I was instructed to report to 
a Bavarian regiment. Within a few days I was wearing that uniform which I 
was not to doff again for nearly six years. 


For me, as for every German, the most memorable period of my life now 
began. Face to face with that mighty struggle, all the past fell away into 
oblivion. With a wistful pride I look back on those days, especially because 
we are now approaching the tenth anniversary of that memorable happening. 


183 


I recall those early weeks of war when a kind fortune permitted me to 
take my place in that heroic struggle among the nations. As the scene unfolds 
itself before my mind, it seems like yesterday. I see myself among my young 
comrades on our first parade drill, and so on, until at last the day came on 
which we were to leave for the front. In common with the others, I had one 
worry during those days. This was a fear that we might arrive too late for the 
fighting at the front. Time and again, that thought disturbed me and every, 
announcement of a victorious engagement left a fear that we might be too late, 
which increased as the news of further victories arrived. 


At long last the day came when we left Munich on active service. For the 
first time in my life, I saw the Rhine, as we journeyed westwards to stand 
guard before that historic German river against its traditional and grasping 
enemy. 


As the first soft rays of the morning sun broke through the light mist and 
disclosed to us the Niederwald Statue, with one accord the whole troop-train 
broke into the strains of Die Wacht am Rhein. I then felt as if my heart would 
burst. 


Then followed a damp, cold night in Flanders. We marched in silence 
throughout the night and as the morning sun came through the mist an iron 
greeting suddenly burst above our heads. Shrapnel exploded in our midst and 
spluttered on the damp ground, but before the smoke of the explosion 
disappeared, a wild ‘Hurrah’ was shouted from two hundred throats in 
response to this, first greeting of Death. 


Then began the whistling of bullets and the booming of cannon, the 
whining and droning of shells; with eyes straining feverishly, we pressed 
forward; quicker and quicker, until we finally came to close-quarter fighting, 
beyond the beet-fields and the meadows. 


Soon the strains of a song reached us from afar. Nearer and nearer, from 
company to company, it came, and while Death began to make havoc in our 
ranks, we passed the song on to those beside us: Deutschland, Deutschland 
tiber Alles, tiber Alles in der Welt! 


After four days in the trenches we came back. Even our step was no 
longer what it had been. Boys of seventeen now looked like grown-up men. 
The rank and file of the List Regiment had not been properly trained in the art 
of warfare, but they knew how to die like old soldiers. 


184 


That was the beginning, and thus we carried on from year to year. A 
feeling of horror replaced the romantic fighting spirit. Enthusiasm cooled down 
gradually and exuberant spirits were quelled by the fear of ever-present Death. 


A time came when there arose within each one of us a conflict between 
the urge to self-preservation and the call of duty, and I had to go through that 
conflict too. As Death sought its prey everywhere and unrelentingly, a 
nameless something rebelled within the weak body and tried to introduce itself 
under the name of common sense; but in reality it was fear, which had taken on 
this cloak in order to impose itself on the individual. 


Then there began an inner persuading and warning difficult to withstand, 
and it was often only the last flicker of conscience which carried the day. But 
the more the voice which advised prudence increased its efforts and the 
clearer and persuasive its appeal, the stronger did resistance become, until 
finally the internal strife was over and the call of duty was triumphant. 


As early as the winter of 1915—16, I had gone through that inner struggle. 
The will had asserted its incontestable mastery. 


Whereas in the early days I went into the fight with a cheer and a laugh, I 
was now habitually calm and resolute, and that frame of mind endured. Fate 
might now put me to the final test without my nerves or reason giving way. The 
young, volunteer had become an old soldier. 


This same transformation took place throughout the whole Army. 
Constant fighting had aged and toughened and hardened it, and what could not 
withstand it, had perforce to give way. 


Only now was it possible to judge that Army. After two and three years 
of continuous fighting, after having been thrown into one battle after another, 
standing up stoutly against superior numbers and superior armament, suffering 
hunger and privation, the time had come when one could assess the value of 
that singular fighting force. 


For a thousand years to come nobody will dare to speak of heroism 
without recalling the German Army of the World War, and then from the dim 
past will emerge the immortal vision of those solid ranks of steel helmets that 
never flinched and never faltered, and as long as Germans live they will be 
proud to remember that these men were sons of their forefathers. 


I was then a soldier and did not wish to meddle in politics, the more so 


185 


because the time was inopportune. I still believe that the most humble stable- 
boy of those days served his country better than the best of, let us say, the 
‘parliamentarians.’ 


My hatred for those chatterers was never greater than in those days when 
all decent men who had anything to say said it point-blank in the enemy’s face, 
or, failing this, kept their mouths shut and did their duty elsewhere. 


I despised those political fellows and if I had had my way I would have 
formed them into a Labour Battalion and given them the opportunity of 
babbling amongst themselves to their hearts’ content, without offence or harm 
to decent people. 


In those days I cared nothing for politics, but I could not help forming an 
opinion on certain phenomena which affected not only the whole nation, but 
also us soldiers in particular. There were two things which caused me the 
greatest anxiety at that time, and which I had come to regard as detrimental to 
our interests. 


Shortly after our first series of victories a certain section of the press 
already began to throw cold water, drip by drip, on the enthusiasm of the 
public. At first this was not, obvious to many people. It was done under the 
mask of good intentions and a spirit of anxious care. The public was told that 
big celebrations of victories were somewhat out of place and were not worthy 
of the dignity of a great nation. The fortitude and valour of German soldiers 
were accepted facts which did not necessarily call for outbursts of rejoicing. 


Furthermore, it was asked, what would foreign opinion have to say about 
these manifestations? Would not foreign opinion react more favourably to a 
quiet and sober form of celebration rather than to all this wild jubilation? 


Surely the time had come—so the press declared—for us Germans to 
remember that this war was not of our seeking and that hence there need be no 
feeling of shame in declaring our willingness to do our share towards effecting 
an understanding among the nations. 


For this reason it would not be wise to sully the radiant deeds of our 
Army with unbecoming jubilation, for the rest of the world would not 
understand this. 


Furthermore, nothing is more appreciated than the modesty with which a 
true hero quietly and unassumingly carries on and forgets. Such was the gist of 


186 


their warning. 


Instead of catching these fellows by their long ears, dragging them to 
some ditch and looping a cord around their necks, so that the victorious 
enthusiasm of the nation should no longer offend their aesthetic sensibilities, a 
general press campaign was now allowed to go on against what was called 
‘unbecoming’ and ‘undignified’ forms of victorious celebration. 


No one seemed to have the faintest idea that when public enthusiasm is 
once damped, nothing can kindle it again when the necessity arises. This 
enthusiasm is an intoxication and must be kept up in that form. 


Without the support of this enthusiastic spirit, how would it be possible 
to endure in a struggle which, according to human standards, made 
overwhelming demands, on the spiritual stamina of the nation? 


I was only too well acquainted with the psychology of the broad masses, 
not to know, that in such cases a magnanimous ‘aestheticism’ cannot fan the fire 
which is needed to keep the iron hot.. In my eyes it was even a mistake not to 
have tried to raise the pitch of public enthusiasm still higher. Therefore, I could 
not at all understand why the contrary policy was adopted, that is to say, the 
policy of damping the public spirit. 


Another thing which irritated me was the manner in which Marxism was 
regarded and accepted. I thought that all this proved how little they knew about 
the Marxist plague. It was believed in all seriousness that the abolition of party 
distinctions during the War had made Marxism a mild and-moderate thing. 


Here there was no question of party, but of a doctrine which was being 
expounded for the express purpose of leading humanity to its destruction. The 
purpose of this doctrine was not understood, because nothing was said about 
that side of the question in our Jew-ridden universities, and because our 
supercilious bureaucratic officials did not think it worth while to read upon a 
subject which had not been prescribed in their university course. 


This mighty revolutionary trend was simply ignored by those 
‘intellectuals’ who did not deign to give it their attention. That is why State 
enterprise nearly always lags behind private enterprise. 


Of these gentry one can truly say that their maxim is: What we don’t 
know won’t bother us. 


187 


In the August of 1914 every German worker was looked upon as a 
Marxist. That was a gross error. When that fateful day dawned, the German 
worker shook off the poisonous clutches of that plague; otherwise he would not 
have been so willing and ready to fight. Yet people were stupid enough to 
imagine that Marxism had now become ‘national’ another apt illustration of the 
fact that those in authority had never taken the trouble to study the real tenor of 
the Marxist teaching. If they had done so, such foolish errors would not have 
been committed. 


Marxism, whose final objective was, is, and will continue to be, the 
destruction of all non-Jewish national States, had to witness in those days of 
July 1914 how the German working-classes, which it had been ensnaring, were 
aroused by the national spirit and rapidly ranged themselves on the side of the 
Fatherland. 


Within a few days the deceptive smoke-screen of that infamous national 
betrayal had vanished into thin air and the Jewish bosses suddenly found 
themselves alone and deserted. It was as if not a vestige had been left of that 
folly and madness with which the masses of the German people had been 
inoculated for sixty years. 


That was indeed an evil day for the betrayers of German Labour. The 
moment, however, that the leaders realised the danger which threatened them 
they pulled the magic cap of deceit over their ears and, without being 
identified, pretended to participate in the national reawakening. 


The time seemed to have arrived for proceeding against the whole 
Jewish gang of public pests. Then it was that action should have been taken 
regardless of any consequent whining or protestation. 


At one stroke, in the August of 1914, all the empty nonsense about 
international solidarity was knocked out of the heads of the German working 
classes. 


A few weeks later, instead of this stupid talk sounding in their ears, they 
heard the noise of American-manufactured shrapnel bursting above the heads 
of the marching columns, as a symbol of international comradeship. 


Now that the German worker had rediscovered the road back to his 
nation, it ought to have been the duty of any government, which had the welfare 
of the people at heart, to take this opportunity of mercilessly rooting out 


188 


everything that was opposed to the national spirit. 


While the flower of the nation’s manhood was dying at the front, those at 
home could, at least, have exterminated this vermin. But, instead of doing so, 
His Majesty the Kaiser held out his hand to these hoary criminals, thus assuring 
them of his protection and allowing them to regain their mental composure. 


Thus the viper could begin its work again. This time, certainly, more 
carefully than before, but all the more destructively. While honest people 
dreamt of reconciliation, these perjured criminals were making preparations 
for a revolution. 


Naturally, I was distressed at the half-measures which were adopted at 
that time, but I never thought it possible that the final consequences could have 
been so disastrous. 


What should have been done then? The ringleaders should have been 
thrown into gaol and tried, thus ridding the nation of them. 


Uncompromising military measures should have been adopted to root out 
the evil. Parties should have been abolished and the Reichstag brought to its 
senses at the point of the bayonet, if necessary. 


It would have been still better if the Reichstag had been dissolved 
immediately. If the Republic to-day dissolves parties when it wants to, there 
was in those days even more justification for applying such a measure, seeing; 
that the very existence of the nation was at stake. 


Of course this suggestion would give rise to the question, Is it possible 
to eradicate ideas by force of arms? Can a Weltanschauung be attacked by 
means of physical force? 


At that time, I turned these questions over and over in my mind. By 
studying analogous cases, exemplified in history, particularly those which had 
arisen from religious circumstances, I came to the following fundamental 
conclusion. Ideals and ideologies, as well as movements grounded on a 
definite spiritual foundation, whether true or false, can never be broken by the 
use of force after a certain stage, except on one condition, namely, that this use 
of force is wielded in the service of a new ideal or Weltanschauung which 
burns with a new flame. 


The application of force alone, without moral support based ona 


189 


spiritual concept, can never bring about the destruction of an ideal or arrest the 
propagation of it, unless one is ready and able ruthlessly to exterminate to a 
man the last upholders of that ideal, and also to wipe out any tradition which it 
may tend to leave behind. 


Now, in the majority of cases, the result of such a course has been to 
exclude such a State, either temporarily or forever, from the circle of States 
that are of political significance, but experience has also shown that such a 
sanguinary method of extirpation affects the better section of the population 
under the persecuting power. 


As a matter of fact, every persecution, which has no spiritual motives to 
support it, is morally unjust and raises opposition among the best elements of 
the population, so much so, that these are driven more and more to champion 
the ideas that are unjustly persecuted. 


With many individuals this arises from the sheer spirit of opposition to 
every attempt at suppressing spiritual things by brute force. 


In this way, the number of convinced adherents of the persecuted 
doctrine increases as the persecution progresses. 


Hence, the total destruction of a new doctrine can be accomplished only 
by a vast plan of extermination; but this, 1n the final analysis, means the loss of 
some of the best blood in a nation or State, and that blood is subsequently 
avenged, because such an internal and total clean-up brings about the collapse 
of the nation’s strength. Such a procedure is always condemned to futility from 
the very start, if the attacked doctrine should happen to have spread beyond a 
small circle. 


That is why, in this case, as with all other growths, the doctrine can be 
exterminated only in its earliest stages. As time goes on its powers of 
resistance increase, until at the approach of age it gives way to younger 
elements, but under another form and from other motives. 


The fact remains that nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine, 
without having some spiritual basis of attack against it, and also to wipe out all 
the organisations it has created, have led in many cases to the very opposite 
being achieved, and that for the following reasons. 


When sheer force is used to combat the spread of a doctrine, then that 
force must be employed systematically and persistently. This means that the 


190 


chances of success in the suppression of a doctrine lie only in the persistent 
and uniform application of the methods chosen. 


The moment hesitation is shown, and periods of tolerance alternate with 
the application of force, the doctrine against which these measures are directed 
will not only recover strength, but every successive persecution will bring to 
its support new adherents who have been shocked by the oppressive methods 


employed. 


The old adherents will become more embittered and their allegiance 
will thereby be strengthened. Therefore, when force is employed, success is 
dependent on the consistent manner in which it is used. 


This persistence, however, is nothing less than the product of definite 
spiritual convictions. Every form of force that is not supported by a, spiritual 
backing will always tie indecisive and uncertain. 


Such a force lacks the stability that can be found only in a 
Weltanschauung which has devoted champions. Such a force is the expression 
of the energy and ruthless determination of the individual temporarily in 
power, and, therefore, it is dependent on the change of persons in whose hands 
it is employed and on their characters and capacities. But there is something 
else to be said. Every Weltanschauung, whether religious or political (and it 
is sometimes difficult to say where the one ends and the other begins) fights not 
so much for the negative destruction of the opposing ideology, as for the 
positive realisation of its own ideology. 


Thus its struggle consists in attack rather than in defence. It has the 
advantage of knowing where its objective lies, as this objective represents the 
realisation of its own ideals. Inversely, it is difficult to say, when the negative 
aim for the destruction of a hostile doctrine is reached and secured. 


For this reason alone a Weltanschauung which is of an aggressive 
character is more definite in plan and more powerful and decisive in action 
than a Weltanschauung which takes up a merely defensive attitude. 


If force be used to combat a spiritual power, that force remains a 
defensive measure only so long as the wielders of it are not the champions and 
apostles of a new spiritual doctrine. 


Summing up, we arrive at the conclusion that every attempt to combat a 
Weltanschauung by means of force will turn out futile in the end, if the struggle 


19] 


fails to take the form of an offensive for the establishment of an entirely new 
spiritual order of things. 


It is only in the struggle between two Weltanschauungen that physical 
force, consistently and ruthlessly applied, will eventually turn the scales in its 
own favour. It was in this that the fight against Marxism had hitherto failed. 


This was also the reason why Bismarck’s socialist legislation failed, and 
was bound to fail in the long run, despite everything. It lacked the basis of a 
new Weltanschauung for whose development and extension the struggle might 
have been taken up. 


To say that the serving up of drivel about a so-called ‘State authority’ or 
‘law and order’ was an adequate foundation for the spiritual driving force ina 
life-and-death struggle, is only what one would expect to hear from the 
wiseacres in high official positions. 


It was because there were no adequate spiritual motives behind this 
offensive that Bismarck was compelled to hand over the administration of his 
socialist legislative measures to the judgment and approval of those circles 
which were themselves the product of the Marxist teaching. 


Thus, when the Iron Chancellor surrendered the fate of his struggle 
against Marxism to the goodwill of the bourgeois Democracy, he was leaving 
the goat to take care of the garden. But this was only the logical result of 
failure to find a fundamentally new Weltanschauung which was diametrically 
opposed to Marxism and inspired by an ardent determination to sweep all 
before it. Thus the result of the Bismarckian campaign was a bitter 
disappointment. 


Were conditions different during the World War, or at the beginning of it? 
Unfortunately, they were not. 


The more I then pondered over the necessity for a change in the attitude 
of the executive government towards Social Democracy, as the incorporation 
of contemporary Marxism, the more I realised the want of a practical substitute 
for this doctrine. 


Supposing Social Democracy were overthrown, what had one to offer 
the masses in its stead? Not a single movement existed which promised any 
success in attracting vast numbers of workers, who would be now more or less 
without leaders, and in holding these workers in its spell. 


192 


It is nonsensical to imagine that the international fanatic who has just 
severed his connection with a class party would forthwith join a bourgeois 
party or, in other words, another class organisation, for, however 
unsatisfactory these various organisations may appear to be, it cannot be 
denied that bourgeois politicians look on the distinction between classes as a 
very important factor in social life, provided, it does not turn out politically 
disadvantageous to them. If they deny this fact, they show themselves not only 
impudent but also mendacious. 


Generally speaking, one should guard against considering the broad 
masses more stupid than they really are. In political matters it frequently 
happens that feeling is a better judge than intellect. 


The opinion that the stupid international attitude of the masses provides 
proof of the unreliability of this feeling, can be immediately and definitely 
refuted by the simple fact that pacifist Democracy is no less fatuous, though it 
draws its supporters almost exclusively from bourgeois circles. 


As long as millions of citizens daily swallow what the Social 
Democratic press tells them, it will becomes these gentlemen to joke at the 
expense of the ‘Comrades,’ for, in the long run, they all swallow the same hash, 
even though it be dished up with different spices. In both cases the cook is one 
and the same—the Jew. 


One should be careful about contradicting established facts. It is an 
undeniable fact that the class question has nothing to do with questions 
concerning ideals, though that dope is administered at election time. Class 
arrogance among a large section of our people, as well as a prevailing 
tendency to look down on the manual labourer, are obvious facts and not the 
fancies of some day-dreamer. 


Nevertheless, it only illustrates the mentality of our so-called intellectual 
circles that they have not yet grasped the fact that circumstances, which are 
incapable of preventing the growth of such a plague as Marxism, are certainly 
not capable of restoring what has been lost. 


The ‘bourgeois’ parties (as they choose to call themselves) will never 
again be able to win over and hold the proletarian masses in their train. That is 
because two worlds are opposed to one another here, in part, naturally, and in 
part, artificially, divided. 


193 


Only one relationship is possible between these two camps, namely, 
open enmity. But in such a fight the younger will come off victorious, and that 
is Marxism. 


In 1914 a fight against Social Democracy was indeed quite conceivable, 
but the lack of any practical substitute made it doubtful how long the fight 
could be kept up. In this respect there was a gaping void. 


Long before the war I was of the same opinion, and that was the reason 
why I could not decide to join any of the parties then existing. 


During the World War my conviction was still further confirmed by the 
manifest impossibility of fighting Social Democracy in anything like a thorough 
way, because for that purpose there should have been a movement that was 
something more than a mere ‘parliamentary’ party, and there was none such. 


I frequently discussed that want with my intimate comrades, and it was 
then, that I first conceived the idea of taking up political work later on. As I 
have often assured my friends, it was just this that induced me, after the war to 
become active as a public speaker, in addition to my professional work, and I 
am sure that this decision was arrived at after much earnest thought.

CHAPTER VI: WAR PROPAGANDA 


In watching the course of political events I was always struck by the 
active part which propaganda played in them. I saw that it was an instrument 
which the Marxist Socialists knew how to handle in a masterly, way and to put 
to good practical use. 


Thus I soon came to realise that the right use of propaganda was an art in 
itself, and that this art was practically unknown to our bourgeois parties. The 
Christian Socialist Party alone, especially in Lueger’s time, showed a certain 
efficiency in the employment of this instrument and owed much of their success 
to it. 


It was during the War, however, that we had the best chance of estimating 
the tremendous results which could be obtained by a propaganda system 
properly carried out. 


Here again, unfortunately, everything was left to the other side, the work 
done on our side being worse than insignificant. It was the total failure of the 
whole German system of information—a failure which was perfectly obvious 
to every soldier—that urged me to consider the problem of propaganda ina 
comprehensive way. 


I had ample opportunity to learn a practical lesson in this matter, for 
unfortunately it was only too well taught us by the enemy. The lack on our side 
was exploited by the enemy in such an efficient manner that one could say it 
showed itself as a real work of genius. 


In that propaganda carried on by the enemy I found admirable sources of 
instruction. The lesson to be learned from this had, unfortunately, no attraction 
for the geniuses on our own side. They were simply above all such things, too 
clever to accept any teaching and, in any case, they did not honestly wish to 
learn anything. 


Had we any propaganda at all? Alas, I can reply only in the negative. All 
that was undertaken in this direction, was so utterly inadequate and 
misconceived from the very beginning, that not only did it prove useless, but at 
times harmful. In substance, it was insufficient. Psychologically, it was all 
wrong. 


197 


Anybody who had carefully investigated the German propaganda must 
have formed that judgment of it. Our authorities did not seem to be clear even 
about the primary question as to whether propaganda is a means or an end. 


Propaganda is a means and must, therefore, be judged in relation to the 
end it is intended to serve. It must be organised in such a way as to be capable 
of attaining its objective, and, as it is quite clear that the importance of the 
objective may vary from the standpoint of general necessity, the essential 
internal character of the propaganda must vary accordingly. 


The cause for which we fought during the War was the noblest and 
highest that man could strive for. We were fighting for the freedom and 
independence of our country, for the security of our future welfare and the 
honour of the nation. 


Despite all views to the contrary, this honour does actually exist, or 
rather it ought to exist, for a nation without honour will sooner or later lose its 
freedom and independence. This is in accordance with the ruling of a higher 
justice, for a generation of poltroons is not entitled to freedom. He who would 
be a cowardly slave cannot have honour; for such honour would soon become 
an object of general scorn. 


Germany was waging war for her very existence. The purpose of her 
war propaganda should have been to strengthen the fighting spirit in that 
struggle and help her to victory. 


But when nations are fighting for their existence on this earth, when the 
question of ‘to be’ or ‘not to be’ has to be answered, then all humane and 
aesthetic considerations must be set aside, for these ideals do not exist of 
themselves somewhere in the air, they are the product of man’s creative 
imagination and will disappear when he disappears from the face of the earth. 
Nature knows nothing of them. 


Moreover, they are characteristic of only a small number of nations, or 
rather of races, and their value depends on the measure in which they spring 
from the racial feeling of the latter. Humane and aesthetic ideals will disappear 
from the inhabited earth when those races disappear which have been their 
creators and champions. 


All such ideals are only of secondary importance when a nation is 
struggling for its existence. They must be prevented from entering into the 


198 


struggle the moment they threaten to weaken the stamina of the nation that is 
waging war. That is always the only visible effect whereby their place in the 
struggle is to be judged. 


In regard to the part played by humane feeling, Moltke said that in time 
of war the essential thing is to get a decision as quickly as possible and that the 
most ruthless methods of fighting are, at the same time, the most humane. 


When people attempt to answer this reasoning by high-faluting talk about 
aesthetics, etc., only one answer can be given, namely, that the vital questions 
involved in the struggle of a nation for its existence must not be subordinated to 
any aesthetic considerations. The yoke of slavery is, and always will remain, 
the most unaesthetic experience that mankind can endure. Do the Schwabing 
decadents look upon Germany’s lot to-day as ‘aesthetic’? Of course, one does 
not discuss such a question with the Jews, because they are the modern 
inventors of this cultural perfume. Their very existence is an incarnate denial 
of the beauty of God’s image in His creation. 


Since these ideas of what is beautiful and humane have no place in 
warfare, they are not to be used as standards of war propaganda. During the 
war, propaganda was a means to an end, and this end was the German nation’s 
struggle for existence. 


Propaganda, therefore, should have been regarded from the standpoint of 
its utility for that purpose. The cruellest weapons were then the most humane, 
provided they helped towards a speedier decision; and only those methods 
were good and beautiful which helped towards securing the dignity and 
freedom of the nation. 


Such was the only possible attitude to adopt towards war propaganda in 
that life-and-death struggle. If those in what are called positions of authority 
had realised this, there would have been no uncertainty about the form and 
employment of war propaganda as a weapon, for it is nothing but a weapon, 
and indeed a most terrifying weapon in the hands of those who know how to 
use it. 


The second question of decisive importance is this: To whom should 
propaganda be made to appeal? To the educated intellectual classes? Or to the 
uneducated masses? 


Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the 


199 


people. Propaganda is not meant for the intellectual classes, or what we call 
the intellectual classes today, which demand scientific enlightenment. 


Propaganda has as little to do with science as an advertisement poster 
has to do with art, as far as concerns the form in which it presents its message. 
The art of the advertisement poster consists in the ability of the designer to 
attract the attention of the crowd through the form and colours he chooses. 


The advertisement poster announcing an exhibition of art has no other 
aim than to convince the public of the importance of the exhibition. The better 
it does that, the better the art of the poster as such. 


Although its purpose is to impress upon the public the importance of the 
exhibition, the poster can never take the place of the artistic objects displayed 
in the exhibition hall. They are something entirely different. 


Therefore, those who wish to study art must study something that is quite 
different from the poster; indeed for that purpose they must do more than 
merely wander through the exhibition galleries. The student of art must 
carefully and thoroughly study each exhibition in order slowly to forma 
judicious opinion on it. 


The situation is the same in regard to what we understand by the word 
‘propaganda.’ The purpose of propaganda is not the scientific instruction of the 
individual, but rather to attract public attention to certain facts, events, urgent 
needs, and so on, the importance of which can be brought home to the masses 
only by this means. 


Here the art of propaganda consists in putting a matter so clearly and 
forcibly before the minds of the people as to create a general conviction 
regarding the reality of a certain fact, the necessity of certain things and the 
imperativeness of something that is essential. 


As this art is not an end in itself and because its purpose must be exactly 
that of the advertisement poster, to attract the attention of the masses and not by 
any means to dispense individual instructions to those who already have an 
educated opinion on things, or who wish to form such an opinion on grounds of 
objective study (because that is not the purpose of propaganda), it must appeal 
to the feelings of the public rather than to their reasoning powers. 


All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its 
intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least intellectual of 


200 


those at whom it is directed. Thus, the larger the public to which its appeal is 
directed, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 


When it is a question of bringing a whole nation within the circle of its 
influence, as happens in the case of war propaganda, then too much attention 
cannot be paid to the necessity of avoiding a high level, which presupposes a 
relatively high degree of intelligence among the public. 


The more modest the scientific level of this propaganda and the more it 
is addressed exclusively to public sentiment, the more decisive will be its 
success, which 1s the best test of the value of a piece of propaganda, and not 
the approbation of a small group of intellectuals or artistic people. 


The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the 
imagination of the public through an appeal to its feelings, in finding the 
appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the 
hearts of the broad masses. 


That this is not understood by those among us whose wits are supposed 
to have been sharpened to the highest pitch, is only another proof of their 
vanity or mental inertia. 


Once we have understood how necessary it is to concentrate the 
persuasive forces of propaganda on the broad masses of the people, we can 
subscribe to the theory that it is a mistake to try to lend propaganda the many- 
sidedness of scientific instruction. 


The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted, and their power 
of understanding is slight. On the other hand, they quickly forget. Such being 
the case, all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare essentials, 
and these must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped formulas. These 
slogans should be persistently repeated until the very last individual has come 
to grasp the idea that has been put forward. If this principle be forgotten, and if 
an attempt be made to be abstract and general, the propaganda will turn out 
ineffective, for the public will not be able to digest or retain what is offered to 
them in this way. 


Therefore, the greater the scope of the message that has to be presented, 
the more necessary is it for propaganda to choose that plan of action which is 
psychologically the most efficient. 


It was, for example, a fundamental mistake to ridicule the enemy, as the 


201 


Austrian and German comic papers made a point of doing in their propaganda. 
The very principle here is a mistaken one, for, when they came face to face 
with the enemy, our soldiers gained quite a different impression. 


Therefore, the mistake had disastrous results. Once the German soldier 
realised what a tough enemy he had to fight, he felt that he had been deceived 
by the manufacturer of the information which had been given him. Therefore, 
instead of strengthening and stimulating his fighting spirit, this information had 
quite the contrary effect and, finally, he lost heart. 


On the other hand, British and American war propaganda was 
psychologically efficient. By picturing the Germans to their own people as 
barbarians and Huns, they were preparing their soldiers for the horrors of war 
and safeguarding them against delusion. 


The most terrific weapons which those soldiers encountered 1n the field 
merely confirmed the information they had already received, and their belief in 
the truth of the assertions made by their respective governments was 
accordingly reinforced. Thus their rage and hatred against the infamous foe 
was increased. 


The terrible havoc caused by the German weapons of war was only 
another illustration of the Hunnish brutality of those barbarians, whereas, on 
the side of the Entente, no time was left for the soldiers to meditate on the 
similar havoc of which their own weapons were capable. 


Thus the British soldier was never allowed to feel that the information 
which he received at home was untrue. 


Unfortunately, the opposite was the case with the Germans, who finally 
wound up by rejecting everything from home as pure swindle and humbug. 


This was possible because at home they thought that the work of 
propaganda could be entrusted to the first ass that came along, or even to 
someone who was fairly intelligent in other respects, and they had no 
conception of the fact that propaganda demands the most skilled brains that can 
be found. 


Thus German war propaganda afforded us an incomparable example of 
how the work of ‘enlightenment’ should not be done and how such an example 
was the result of an entire failure to take into account any psychological 
considerations whatsoever. 


202 


From the enemy, however, a fund of valuable knowledge could be gained 
by those, who kept their eyes open, whose powers of preception had not yet 
become dimmed, and who during four-and-a-half years had to experience the 
perpetual flood of enemy propaganda. 


The worst thing of all was that our people did not understand the very 
first condition which has to be fulfilled in every kind of propaganda, namely, a 
systematically one sided attitude towards every problem that has to be dealt 
with. 


In this respect, so many errors were committed, even from the very 
beginning of the war, that it was justifiable to doubt whether so much folly 
could be attributed solely to the stupidity of people in higher quarters. 


What, for example, should we say of a poster which purported to 
advertise some new brand of soap by insisting on the excellent qualities of the 
competitive brands? We should naturally shake our heads, and the same is true 
of political advertisement. 


The aim of propaganda is not to try to pass judgment on conflicting 
rights, giving each its due, but exclusively to emphasise the right which we’re 
asserting. 


Propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and, in so far as it 
is favourable to the other side, present it according to the theoretical rules of 
justice, but it must present only that aspect of the truth which is favourable to 
its own side. 


It was a fundamental mistake to discuss the question of who was 
responsible for the outbreak of the war and to declare that the sole 
responsibility could not be attributed to Germany. The sole responsibility 
should have been laid on the shoulders of the enemy, even had this not been 
strictly true, as indeed it was. 


What was the consequence of these half-measures? The broad masses of 
the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of public jurisprudence 
nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned judgment in given cases, 
but they are a vacillating crowd of human children who are constantly 
wavering between one idea and another. 


AS soon as our own propaganda made the slightest suggestion that the 
enemy had a certain amount of justice on his side, then we laid down the basis 


203 


on which the justice of our own cause could be questioned. 


The masses are not in a position to discern where the enemy’s fault ends 
and where our own begins. In such a case, they become hesitant and distrustful, 
especially when the enemy does not make the same mistake, but heaps all the 
blame on his adversary. 


Could there be any clearer proof of this than the fact that finally our own 
people believed what was said by the enemy’s propaganda, which was 
uniform and consistent in its assertions, rather than in our own propaganda? 


This disbelief was, of course, increased by the mania for objectivity 
which afflicts our people. Everybody began to be careful about doing an 
injustice to the enemy, even at the cost of seriously injuring, and even ruining, 
his own people and State. 


Naturally, the masses were not conscious of the fact that those in 
authority had failed to study the subject from this angle. 


The great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook 
that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober 
reasoning. 


This sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple and consistent. It is 
not highly differentiated, but has only the negative and positive notions of love 
and hatred, right and wrong, truth and falsehood. Its notions are never partly 
this and partly that. 


Those responsible for English propaganda, especially understood this in 
a marvellous degree and put what they understood into practice. They allowed 
no half-measures, which might have given rise to doubt. 


Proof of how brilliantly they understood that the feeling of the masses is 
something primitive was shown in their policy of publishing tales of horror 
and outrages which fitted in with the real horrors of the time, thereby cleverly 
and ruthlessly preparing the ground for moral solidarity at the front, even in 
times of great defeats. 


Further, the way in which they pilloried the German enemy as solely 
responsible for the war—which was a brutal and absolute falsehood—and the 
way in which they proclaimed his guilt was excellently calculated to reach the 
masses, realising that these are always extremist in their feeling. Thus it was 


204 


that this atrocious lie was positively believed. 


The effectiveness of this kind of propaganda is well illustrated by the 
fact that after four-and-a-half years, the enemy was not only still carrying on 
his propagandist work, but it was already undermining the stamina of our 
people at home. That our propaganda did not achieve similar results is not to 
be wondered at, because it contained the germs of inefficiency by reason of its 
ambiguity, and because of the very nature of its contents one could not expect it 
to make the necessary impression on the masses. 


Only our feckless ‘statesmen’ could have imagined that the enthusiasm 
which is necessary to kindle that spirit which leads men to die for their country 
could be nourished on pacifist ‘slops’ of this kind, and so this product of ours 
was not only worthless but detrimental. 


No matter what the amount of talent employed in the organisation of 
propaganda, it will have no result if due account is not taken of one 
fundamental principle. 


Propaganda must be limited to a few simple themes and these must be 
presented again and again. Here, as in innumerable other cases, perseverance 
is the first and most important condition of success. Particularly in the field of 
propaganda, placid aesthetes and blasé intellectuals should never be allowed 
to take the lead. The former would readily transform the impressive character 
of real propaganda into something suitable only for literary tea-parties. 


As to the second class of persons, one must always beware of this pest; 
for, in consequence of their insensibility to normal impressions, they are 
constantly seeking fresh thrills. 


Such people grow sick and tired of everything. They always long for 
change and will always be incapable of putting themselves in the position of 
picturing the wants of their less callous fellow-creatures in their immediate 
neighbourhood, let alone trying to understand them. 


The blasé intellectuals are always the first to criticise propaganda, or 
rather its message, because this appears to them to be outmoded and trivial. 
They are always looking for something new, always yearning for change, and 
thus they become the mortal enemies of every effort that is made to influence 
the masses in an effective way. 


The moment the organisation and message of a propaganda movement 


205 


begins to be orientated according to their tastes, it becomes incoherent and 
scattered. 


It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a 
view to pleasing these blasé gentry. Its chief function is to convince the 
masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that 
they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed 
in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must 
always emphasise the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in 
many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be 
laid on the, slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and 
dynamic in its effects. 


Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, 
with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we 
shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a 
persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a 
business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance 
with which it is employed. 


In this respect also, the propaganda organised by our enemies set us an 
excellent example. It confined itself to a few themes, which were meant 
exclusively for mass consumption, and it repeated these themes with untiring 
perseverance. 


Once these fundamental themes and the manner of placing them before 
the world were recognised as effective, they adhered to them without the 
slightest alteration for the whole duration of, the war. At first, all of it 
appeared to be idiotic in its impudent assertiveness. 


Later on, it was looked upon as disturbing, but finally it was believed. 
Four-and-a-half years later, a revolution, the slogans of which were borrowed 
from enemy war-time propaganda, broke out in Germany. 


In England they came to understand something else, namely, that the 
possibility of success in the use of this spiritual weapon consists in the mass 
employment of it, and that, when employed in this way, it brings full returns for 
the large expense incurred. 


In England propaganda was regarded as a weapon of the first order, 


206 


whereas with us it represented the last hope of a livelihood for our 
unemployed politicians and a snug job for shirkers of the modest heroic type. 


Taken all in all, its results were negative. 


207

209 


CHAPTER VII: THE REVOLUTION IN 1918 


The enemy started his propaganda among our soldiers. From 1916 
onwards it steadily became more intensive, and at the beginning of 1918 it had 
swollen into a storm-flood. One could now judge the effects of this 
proselytizing movement step by step. 


Gradually, our soldiers began to think just in the way the enemy wished 
them to think. On the German side there was no counter-propaganda. 


At that time, they army authorities, under our able and resolute 
Commander were willing and ready to take up the fight in the propaganda 
domain also, but unfortunately, they did not have the necessary means of 
carrying that intention into effect. 


Moreover, the army authorities would have made a psychological 
mistake had they undertaken this task of mental training. 


To be effective, it had to come from the home front, for only thus could it 
be successful among men who for nearly four years now had been performing 
immortal deeds of heroism and undergoing all sorts of privations for the sake 
of that home. 


But what were the people at home doing? Was their failure to act due 
merely to lack of intelligence or bad faith? 


In the summer of 1918, after the evacuation of the southern bank of the 
Marne, the German press adopted a policy which was so woefully 
inopportune, and even criminally stupid, that I daily and with growing fury 
used to ask myself the question, ‘Is it really true that we have nobody who 
dares to put an end to this process of spiritual sabotage which 1s being carried 
on among our heroic troops?’ 


What happened in France during those days of 1914, when our armies 
invaded that country and were marching in triumph from one victory to 
another? 


What happened in Italy when the Italian armies collapsed on the Isonzo 
front? What happened in France again during the spring of 1918, when German 
divisions took the main French positions by storm and heavy long-distance 
artillery bombarded Paris? 


210 


How enemy propaganda whipped up the flagging courage of those troops 
who were retreating and fanned the fires of national enthusiasm among them! 
How their propaganda and their marvellous aptitude in the exercise of mass- 
influence reawakened the fighting spirit in that broken front and hammered into 
the heads of the soldiers a firm belief in final victory! 


Meanwhile, what were our people doing in this sphere? Nothing, or even 
worse than nothing. Again and again. I used to become enraged and indignant 
as I read the latest papers and realised the nature of the mass-murder they were 
committing through their influence on the minds of the people and the soldiers. 


More than once, I was tormented by the thought that, if Providence had 
put the conduct of German propaganda into my hands, instead of into the hands 
of those incompetent and even criminal ignoramuses and weaklings, the 
outcome of the struggle might have been different. 


During those months, I felt, for the first time that Fate was dealing 
adversely with me in keeping me on the fighting front and in a position where 
any chance bullet from some Negro’s rifle might finish me, whereas I could 
have done the Fatherland a real service in another sphere, for I was then 
presumptuous enough to believe that I would have been successful in managing 
the propaganda business. 


But I was unknown, one among eight millions. Hence, it was better for 
me to keep my mouth shut and do my duty as well as I could, in the position to 
which I had been assigned. 


In the summer of 1915, the first enemy leaflets were dropped on our 
trenches. They all told more or less the same story, with some variations in the 
form of it. 


The story was that: 


-Distress was steadily on the increase in Germany; that the war would 
last indefinitely; 


-That the prospect of victory for us was becoming fainter day by day; 
that the people at home were yearning for peace, but that ‘militarism’ and the 
Kaiser would not permit it; 


-That the world was not waging war against the German people but only 
against the man who was exclusively responsible, the Kaiser; 


211 


-That until this enemy of world-peace was removed there could be no 
end to the conflict; 


-But that, when the war was over, the Liberal and democratic nations 
would receive the Germans as collaborators in the League for World Peace. 
This would be done the moment ‘Prussian Militarism’ had been finally 
destroyed. 


To illustrate and substantiate all these statements, the leaflets very often 
contained ‘Letters from Home,’ the contents of which appeared to confirm the 
enemy’s propaganda message. 


Generally speaking, we only laughed at all these efforts. The leaflets 
were read, sent to base headquarters, then forgotten until a favourable wind 
once again blew a fresh consignment into the trenches. These were mostly 
dropped from aeroplanes which were used specially for that purpose. 


One feature of this propaganda was very striking, namely, that in sections 
where Bavarian troops were stationed, every effort was made by the enemy 
propagandists to stir up feeling against the Prussians, assuring the soldiers that 
Prussia, and Prussia alone, was the guilty party, who was responsible for 
bringing on and continuing the war, and that there was no hostility whatsoever 
towards the Bavarians, but that there could be no possibility of coming to their 
assistance so long as they continued to serve Prussian militarism and helped to 
pull the ‘Prussian chestnuts out of the fire.’ 


This persistent propaganda began to have a real influence on our 
soldiers in 1915. The feeling against Prussia grew quite noticeable among the 
Bavarian troops, but those in authority did nothing to counteract it. 


This was something more than a mere crime of omission, for sooner or 
later, not only the Prussians were bound to have to atone severely for it, but the 
whole German nation, and consequently the Bavarians themselves also. In this 
direction the enemy propaganda began to achieve undoubted success from 
1916 onwards. Ina similar way letters coming directly from home had long 
since been exercising their effect. There was now no further necessity for the 
enemy to broadcast such letters in leaflet form. 


The Government did nothing to counteract this influence from home 
except to issue a few supremely stupid ‘warnings’. The whole front was 
drenched in this poison which thoughtless women at home sent out, without 


212 


suspecting for a moment that the enemy’s chances of final victory were thus 
being strengthened or that the sufferings of their own men at the front were thus 
being prolonged and rendered more severe. 


These stupid letters written by German women eventually cost the lives 
of hundreds of thousands of our men. 


Thus in 1916 several distressing phenomena were already manifest. The 
whole front was complaining and ‘grousing,’ discontented over many things 
and often justifiably so. While they were hungry and yet patient, and their 
relatives at home were in distress, in other quarters there was feasting and 
revelry. Even at the front itself everything was not as it ought to have been in 
this respect. 


Even in the early stages of the War the soldiers were sometimes prone to 
complain, but such criticism was of a domestic nature. The man who at one 
moment groused and grumbled ceased his murmur after a few moments and 
went about his duty silently, as if this were a matter of course. 


The company which had given signs of discontent a moment earlier hung 
on now to its bit of trench, defending it tooth and nail, as if Germany’s fate 
depended on those few hundred yards of mud, and shellholes. The glorious old 
Army was still at its post. 


A sudden change in my own fortunes soon placed me in a position where 
I had first-hand experience of the sharp contrast between this old Army and the 
home front. 


At the end of September 1916 my division was sent into the Battle of the 
Somme. For us, this was the first of a series of heavy engagements, and the 
impression created was that of a veritable inferno, rather than war. Through 
weeks of incessant artillery bombardment we stood firm, at times ceding a 
little ground but then taking it again, and never giving way. 


On October 7th, I was wounded, but had the luck to be able to get back 
to our lines and was then ordered to be sent by ambulance-train to Germany. 


Two years had passed since I had left home, an almost endless period in 
such circumstances. I could hardly imagine what Germans looked like except 
in uniform. In the clearing hospital at Hermies, I was startled when I suddenly 
heard the voice of a German woman who was acting as nursing sister and 
talking with one of the wounded men lying near me. To hear such a voice for 


213 


the first time in two years! 


The nearer our ambulance-train approached the German frontier, the 
more restless each one of us became. En route we recognised all these places 
through which we had passed two years before as young volunteers—Brussels, 
Louvain, Liege—and finally we thought we recognised the first German 
homestead, with its familiar high gables and picturesque window-shutters. 
Home! 


In October 1914, our hearts had been afire with wild enthusiasm as we 
crossed this frontier. Now silence and profound emotion reigned supreme. 


Each one was happy to think that Fate had permitted him to see once 
again this lend for the protection of which he had offered his life, and each one 
was almost ashamed to allow the other to see his eyes. 


Almost on the second anniversary of my departure for the front I entered 
the hospital at Beelitz, near Berlin. 


What a change! From the mud of the Somme battlefields to the spotless 
white beds in this wonderful building! One hesitated at first before entering 
them. It was only by slow stages that one could grow accustomed to this new 
world again, but, unfortunately, there were certain other respects in which this 
new world was different. 


The spirit of the Army at the front appeared to be out of place here. For 
the first time I encountered something which up to then was unknown at the 
front, namely, boasting of one’s own cowardice, for, though we certainly heard 
complaining and grousing at the front, this was never in the spirit of any 
agitation to insubordination and certainly not an attempt to glorify one’s fear. 


Out there at the front a coward was a coward and nothing else, and the 
contempt which his weakness aroused in others was general, just as the real 
hero was admired all round. But here in hospital the spirit was quite different 
in some respects. 


Loud-mouthed agitators were busy here in heaping ridicule on the good 
soldier and painting the weak-kneed poltroon in glorious colours. A couple of 
miserable human specimens were the ringleaders in this process of defamation. 


One of them boasted of having intentionally injured his hand on barbed 
wire entanglements in order to get sent to hospital. Although his wound was 


214 


only a slight one, it appeared that he had been here for a very long time and 
would manage to remain here indefinitely, just as he had managed to get sent 
here in the ambulance-train through swindling. 


This pestilential specimen actually had the audacity to parade his 
knavery as the manifestation of a courage which was superior to that of the 
brave soldier who dies a hero’s death. 


There were many who heard this talk in silence, but there were others 
who expressed their assent to what the fellow said. 


Personally I was disgusted at the thought that a seditious agitator of this 
kind should be allowed to remain in such an institution. 


What could be done? The hospital authorities here must have known who 
and what he was, and actually they did know, but still they did nothing about it. 
As soon as I was able to walk once again I obtained leave to visit Berlin. 
Bitter want was in evidence everywhere. The metropolis, with its teeming 
millions, was suffering from hunger. 


Discontent was rife. The talk that was current in the various places of 
refreshment and in the hospices frequented by the soldiers was much the same 
as that in our hospital. The impression gained was that these fellows purposely 
singled out such places in order to spread their views. 


In Munich conditions were far worse. After my discharge from hospital I 
was sent to a reserve battalion there. I felt as if | were in some strange town. 


Anger, discontent, complaints met one’s ears wherever one went. The 
morale of the men in the reserve battalion itself was indescribably bad. 


To a certain extent this was due to the infinitely maladroit manner in 
which the soldiers who had returned from the front were treated by the 
instructors who had never seen a day’s active service and who, on that 
account, were partly incapable of adopting the proper attitude towards the old 
soldiers. 


Naturally those old soldiers displayed certain characteristics which had 
been developed from the experience; in the trenches. 


The officers of the reserve units could not understand these peculiarities, 
whereas the officer home from active service was at least in a position to 


215 


understand them for himself. 


As a result he received more respect from the men than officers at the 
home headquarters. But, apart from all this, the general spirit was deplorable. 


The art of shirking was looked upon almost as a proof of superior 
intelligence, and devotion to duty was considered a sign of weakness or 
stupidity. 


The administrative offices were staffed by Jews. Almost every clerk 
was a Jew and every Jew was a clerk. I was amazed at this multitude of 
‘warriors’, who belonged to the chosen race, and could not help comparing it 
with their slender numbers in the fighting lines. 


In the business world the situation was even worse. Here the Jews had 
actually become ‘indispensable.’ Like leeches, they were slowly sucking the 
blood from the pores of the national body. 


By means of newly-floated war-companies an instrument had been 
discovered whereby all national trade was throttled, so that no business could 
be carried on freely. 


Special emphasis was laid on the necessity for unhampered 
centralisation. Hence, as early as 1916—17, practically all production was 
under the control of Jewish finance. 


But against whom was the anger of the people directed? It was then, that 
I already saw the fateful day approaching which must finally bring the débacle, 
unless timely preventive measures were taken. 


While Jewry was busy despoiling the nation and tightening the screws of 
its despotism, the work of inciting the people against the Prussians was 
intensified and just as nothing was done at the front to put a stop to this 
venomous propaganda, so here at home no official steps were taken against it. 


Nobody seemed capable of understanding that the collapse of Prussia 
could never bring about the rise of Bavaria. On the contrary, the collapse of the 
one must necessarily drag the other down with it. 


This kind of behaviour affected me very deeply. In it I could see only a 
clever Jewish trick for diverting public attention from themselves to others. 
While Prussians and Bavarians were squabbling, the Jews were taking away 


216 


the sustenance of both from under their very noses. While Prussians were being 
abused in Bavaria, the Jews organised the revolution and with one stroke 
smashed both Prussia and Bavaria. 


I could not tolerate this execrable squabbling among people of the same 
German stock and preferred to be at the front once again. Therefore, just after 
my arrival in Munich I reported myself for service again. At the beginning of 
March 1917, I rejoined my old regiment at the front. 


Towards the end of 1917 it seemed as if we had got over the worst 
phases of moral depression at the front. After the Russian collapse the whole 
Army recovered its courage and hope, and all were gradually becoming more 
and more convinced that the struggle would end in our favour. We could sing 
once again. The ravens were ceasing to croak. Faith in the future of the 
Fatherland was once more in the ascendant. The Italian collapse in the autumn 
of 1917 had a wonderful effect, for this victory proved that it was possible to 
bleak through another, front besides the Russian. 


This inspiring thought now became dominant in the minds of millions at 
the front and encouraged them to look forward with confidence to the spring of 
1918. It was quite obvious that the enemy was in a state of depression. 


During this winter the front was somewhat quieter than usual, but that 
was the lull before the storm. Just when preparations were being made to 
launch a final offensive which would bring this seemingly eternal struggle to an 
end, while endless columns of transports were bringing men and munitions to 
the front, and while the men were being trained for that final onslaught, then it 
was that the greatest act of treachery during the whole War was accomplished 
in Germany. 


Germany must not win the war. At that moment when victory seemed 
ready to alight on the German standards, a conspiracy was arranged for the 
purpose of striking at the heart of the Germany spring offensive with one blow 
from the rear and thus making victory impossible. 


A general strike was organised in the munitions factories. If this 
conspiracy had achieved its purpose, the German front would have collapsed 
and the wishes of the Vorwarts (the organ of the Social Democratic Party) that 
this time victory should not rest with the German banners, would have been 
fulfilled. 


217 


For want of munitions, the front would have been broken through within 
a few weeks, the offensive would have been effectively stopped and the 
Entente saved. Then international finance would assume control over Germany 
and the internal objective of the Marxist betrayal of the nations would be 
achieved. 


That objective was the destruction of the national economic system and 
the establishment of international capitalistic domination in its stead. This goal 
has really been reached, thanks to the stupid credulity of the one side and the 
unspeakable cowardice of the other. 


The munitions strike, however, did not bring the final success that had 
been hoped for, namely, to starve the front of ammunition. It lasted too short a 
time for the lack of ammunition as such to bring disaster to the Army, as was 
originally planned, but the moral damage was much more terrible. 


In the first place, what was the Army fighting for if the people at home 
did not wish it to be victorious? For whom then were those enormous 
sacrifices and privations being made and endured? Must the soldiers fight for 
victory while the home front went on strike against it? 


In the second place, what effect did this move have on the enemy? In the 
winter of 1917-18, dark clouds hovered in the firmament of the Entente. For 
nearly four years onslaught after onslaught had been made against the German 
giant, but had failed to bring him to the ground. He had to keep them at bay 
with one arm that held the defensive shield, because his other arm had, to be 
free to wield the sword against his enemies, now in the East and now in the 
South. But at last these enemies were overcome and his rear was now free for 
the conflict in the West. 


Rivers of blood had been shed for the accomplishment of that task; but 
now the sword was free to combine in battle with the shield on the Western 
Front, and since the enemy had hitherto failed to break the German defence 
here, the Germans themselves had now to launch the attack. The enemy feared 
the attack and trembled for his victory. 


In Paris and London conferences followed one another in unending 
succession. Even the enemy propaganda encountered difficulties. It was no 
longer so easy to demonstrate that the prospect of a German victory was 
hopeless. A prudent silence reigned at the front, even among the troops of the 
Entente. The insolence of their masters had suddenly subsided. A disturbing 


218 


truth began to dawn on them. Their opinion of the German soldier had changed. 
Hitherto they were able to picture him as a kind of fool whose end would be 
destruction, but now they found themselves face to face with the soldier who 
had overcome their Russian ally. 


The policy of restricting the offensive to the East, which had been 
imposed on the German military authorities by the necessities of the situation, 
now seemed to the Entente a tactical stroke of genius. 


For three years these Germans had been battering away at the Russian 
front without any apparent success at first. Those fruitless efforts were almost 
sneered at, for it was thought that in the long run the Russian giant would 
triumph through sheer force of numbers. Germany would be worn out through 
shedding so much blood, and facts appeared to confirm this hope. 


Since the days of September 1914, when, for the first time, interminable 
columns of Russian prisoners of war had poured into German, after the Battle 
of Tannenberg, it seemed as if the stream would never end, but that as soon as 
one army was defeated and routed, another took its place. 


The supply of soldiers which the gigantic empire placed at the disposal 
of the Czar seemed inexhaustible; new victims were always at hand for the 
holocaust of war. How long could Germany hold out in this competition? 
Would not the day finally have to came when, after the last victory which the 
Germans would achieve, there would still remain reserve armies in Russia to 
be mustered for the final battle? And what then? 


According to human standards, a Russian victory over Germany might be 
delayed, but it would have to come in the long run. All the hopes that had been 
based on Russia were now lost. The ally who had sacrificed the most blood on 
the altar of their mutual interests had come to the end of his resources and lay 
prostrate before his unrelenting foe. 


A feeling of terror and dismay came over the Entente soldiers who had 
hitherto been buoyed up by blind faith. They feared the coming spring, for, 
seeing that they had hitherto failed to break the Germans when the latter could 
concentrate only part of their fighting strength on the Western Front, how could 
they count on victory now that the undivided forces of that amazing land of 
heroes appeared to be gathering for a massed attack in the West? 


The shadow of the events which had taken place in South Tyrol and the 


219 


spectre of General Cadorna’s defeated armies, were reflected in the gloomy 
faces of the Entente troops in Flanders. 


Faith in victory gave way to fear of defeat to come. Then, on those cold 
nights, when one almost heard the tread of the German armies advancing to the 
great assault, and the decision was being awaited in fear and trembling, 
suddenly a lurid light was set aglow in Germany and sent its rays into the last 
shell-hole on the enemy’s front. 


At the very moment when the German divisions were receiving their 
final orders for the great offensive, a general strike broke out in Germany. 


At first the world was dumbfounded. Then the enemy propaganda began 
activities once again and pounced on this theme at the eleventh hour. All ofa 
sudden, a means had come which could be utilised to revive the sinking 
confidence of the Entente soldiers. 


The probability of victory could now be presented as certain, and the 
anxious foreboding in regard to coming events could now be transformed into a 
feeling of resolute assurance. 


The regiments that had to bear the brunt of the greatest German onslaught 
in history could now be inspired with the conviction that the final decision in 
this War would not be won by the audacity of the German assault, but rather by 
the powers of endurance on the side of the defence. 


Let the Germans now have whatever victories they liked, the revolution 
and not the victorious Army was welcomed in the Fatherland. 


British, French, and American newspapers began to spread this belief 
among their readers while a very ably-conducted propaganda encouraged the 
morale of their troops at the front. 


‘Germany facing Revolution! Allied victory inevitable!’ That was the 
best medicine to set the staggering Poilu and Tommy on their feet once again. 
Our rifles and machine-guns could now open fire once again; but instead of 
effecting a panic-stricken retreat, they were now met with a determined 
resistance that was full of confidence. 


That was the result of the strike in the munitions factories. Throughout 
the enemy countries faith in victory was thus revived and strengthened, and that 
paralysing feeling of despair which had hitherto made itself felt on the Allied 


220 


front was banished. Consequently, the strike cost the lives of thousands of 
German soldiers, but the despicable instigators of that dastardly strike were 
candidates for the highest public office in the Germany of the Revolution. 


At first it was apparently possible to overcome the repercussion of these 
events on the German soldiers, but on the enemy’s side they had a lasting 
effect. Here the resistance had lost all the character of an army fighting for a 
hopeless cause. In its place, there was now a grim determination to struggle on 
to victory, for as far as it was possible to foresee, victory would now be 
assured, if the Western Front could hold out against the German offensive even 
for a few months. 


The Allied parliaments recognised the possibilities of better future and 
voted huge sums of money for the continuation of the propaganda which was 
employed for the purpose of breaking up the internal unity of Germany. 


I had the luck to be able to take part in the first two offensives and in the 
final offensive. These have left on me the most stupendous impressions of my 
life—stupendous, because now, for the last time, the struggle lost its defensive 
character and assumed the character of an offensive, just as in 1914. 


A sigh of relief went up from the German trenches and dugouts, when 
finally, after three years of endurance in that inferno, the day for the settling of 
accounts had come. Once again the lusty cheering of victorious battalions was 
heard, as they hung the last crowns of the immortal laurel on the standards 
which they consecrated to Victory. 


Once again the strains of patriotic songs soared upwards to the heavens 
above the endless columns of marching troops, and for the last time the Lord 
smiled on his ungrateful children. 


In the summer of 1918, a feeling of sultry oppression hung over the front. 
At home they were quarrelling. About what? We heard a great deal among 
various units at the front. The War was now a hopeless affair, and only the 
foolhardy could think of victory. 


It was not the people, but the capitalists and the monarchy who were 
interested in carrying on. Such were the ideas that came from home and were 
discussed at the front. 


At first this gave rise to only a very slight reaction. What did universal 
suffrage matter to us? Is this what we had been fighting for throughout those 


221 


four years? It was a dastardly piece of robbery thus to filch from the graves of 
our heroes the ideals for which they had fallen, It was not to the slogan, ‘Long 
live universal suffrage,’ that our troops in Flanders once faced certain death, 
but to the cry: “Deutschland tuber Alles in der Welt’ !—a small but by no means 
an unimportant difference. 


The majority of those who were shouting for this suffrage were absent 
when it came to fighting for it. All this political rabble were strangers to us at 
the front. During those days only a fraction of this parliamentarian gentry were 
to be seen where honest Germans foregathered. The old soldiers who had 
fought at the front had little liking for those new war aims of Messrs. Ebert, 
Scheidemann, Barth, Liebknecht and others. We could not understand why, all 
of a sudden, the shirkers should arrogate all executive powers to themselves, 
without having any regard to the Army. 


From the very beginning, I had my own definite personal views. I 
intensely loathed the whole gang of miserable party politicians who had 
betrayed the people. I had long ago realised that the interests of the nation 
played only a very small part with this disreputable crew and that what 
counted with them was the possibility of filling their own empty pockets. 


My opinion was that those people thoroughly deserved to be hanged, 
because they were ready to sacrifice the peace and, if necessary, allow 
Germany to be defeated just to serve their own ends. 


To consider their wishes would mean to sacrifice the interests of the 
working-classes for the benefit of a gang of thieves. To meet their wishes 
meant to agree to sacrifice Germany. 


Such, too, was the opinion still held by the majority of the Army, but the 
reinforcements which came from home were fast becoming worse and worse 
—so much so that their arrival was a source of weakness rather than of 
strength to our fighting forces. 


The young recruits, in particular, were for the most part useless. 
Sometimes it was hard to believe that they were sons of the same nation that 
sent its youth into the battles that were fought round Ypres. 


In August and September the symptoms of moral disintegration increased 
more and more rapidly, although the enemy’s offensive was not at all 
comparable to the frightfulness, of our own former defensive battles. 


De 


In comparison with this offensive, the battles fought on the Somme and in 
Flanders remained in our memories as the most terrible of all horrors. 


At the end of September my division occupied, for the third time, those 
positions which we had once taken by storm as young volunteers. What a 
memory! 


Here we had received our baptism of fire, in October and November 
1914. With a burning love for the mother country in their hearts and a song on 
their lips, our young regiment went into action as if going to a dance. The most 
precious blood was sacrificed freely here in the belief that it was shed to 
protect the freedom and independence of the Fatherland. 


In July 1917, we set foot for the second time on what we regarded as 
sacred soil. Were not our best comrades at rest here, some of them little more 
than boys—the soldiers who had rushed into death for their country’s sake, 
their eyes glowing with enthusiastic ardour? 


The older ones among us, who had been with the regiment from the 
beginning, were deeply moved as we stood on this sacred spot where we had 
sworn ‘Loyalty and duty unto death.’ Three years ago the regiment had taken 
this position by storm; now it was called upon to defend it in a gruelling 
struggle. With an artillery bombardment that lasted three weeks, the British 
prepared for their great offensive in Flanders. There the spirit of the dead 
seemed to live again. 


The regiment dug itself into the mud, clung to its shell-holes and craters, 
neither flinching nor wavering, but growing smaller in numbers day by day. 
Finally the British launched their attack on July 31st, 1917. 


We were relieved in the beginning of August. The regiment had dwindled 
down to a few companies, who staggered back, mud-encrusted, more like 
phantoms than human beings. Besides a few hundred yards of shell-holes, 
death was all that the British gained. 


Now, in the autumn of 1918, we stood for the third time on the ground we 
had stormed in 1914. The village of Comines, which had formerly served us as 
base, was now within the fighting zone. 


Although little had changed in the surrounding district itself, the men had 
become different, somehow or other. They now talked politics. As everywhere 
else, the poison from home was having its effect here also. The fresh drafts 


223 


proved a complete failure. They had come directly from home. 


During the night of October 13th—14th, the British opened an attack with 
gas on the front south of Ypres. They used mustard gas whose effect was 
unknown to us, at least from personal experience. I was destined to experience 
it that very night. On a hill south of Wervick, on the evening of October 13th, 
we were subjected for several hours to a heavy bombardment with gas-shells, 
which continued throughout the night with more or less even intensity. 


About midnight a number of us were put out of action, some for ever. 
Towards morning, I also began to feel pain. It increased with every quarter of 
an hour, and about seven o’clock my eyes were scorching as I staggered back 
and delivered the last dispatch I was destined to carry in this war. 


A few hours later my eyes were like glowing coals, and all was 
darkness around me. I was sent into hospital at Pasewalk in Pomerania, and 
there it was that I was to hear of the Revolution. 


For a long time there had been something in the air which was 
indefinable and oppressive. People were saying that something was bound to 
happen within the next few weeks, although I could not imagine what this 
meant. 


In the first instance I thought of a strike similar to the one which had 
taken place in the spring. 


Unfavourable rumours were constantly coming from the Navy, which 
was said to be ina state of ferment, but this seemed to be a crazy notion put 
about by certain individuals, rather than something which concerned many 
people. 


It is true that at the hospital they were all talking about the end of the war 
and hoping that this was not far off, but nobody thought that the decision would 
come immediately. I was not able to read the newspapers. 


In November, the general tension increased. Then one day disaster broke 
in upon us suddenly and without warning. Sailors came in motor-lorries and 
called on us to rise inrevolt. A few Jews were the ‘leaders’ in that combat for 
the ‘Liberty, Beauty, and Dignity’ of our national existence. 


Not one of them had seen active service at the front. By way of a hospital 
for venereal diseases these three Orientals had been seat back home. Now they 


224 


were hoisting their red rags here. 


During the last few days I had begun to feel somewhat better. The 
burning pain in my eye-sockets had become less severe. Gradually, I was able 
to distinguish the general outlines of my immediate surroundings, and it was 
permissible to hope that I would at least recover my sight sufficiently to be 
able to take up some profession later on. That I would ever be able to draw or 
design again was naturally out of the question. 


Thus I was on the way to recovery when the frightful hour came. My first 
thought was that this outbreak of high treason was only a local affair. I tried to 
spread this belief among my comrades. 


My Bavarian hospital-mates, in particular, were readily responsive. 
Their inclinations were anything but revolutionary. I could not imagine this 
madness breaking out in Munich, for it seemed to me that loyalty to the House 
of Wittelsbach was, after all, stronger than the will of a few Jews, and so I 
could not help believing that this was merely a revolt in the Navy and that it 
would be suppressed within the next few days. 


The next few days brought with them the most terrible certainty. The 
rumours grew more and more persistent. I was told that what I had considered 
to be a local affair was in reality a general revolution. In addition to this, from 
the front came the shameful news that they wished to capitulate! What! Was 
such a thing possible? 


On November 10th, the local pastor visited the hospital for the purpose 
of delivering a short address, and that was how we came to know the whole 
Story. 


I was ina fever of excitement as I listened to the address. The reverend 
old gentleman seemed to be trembling when he informed us that the House of 
Hohenzollern should no longer wear the Imperial Crown, that the Fatherland 
had become a ‘Republic,’ that we should pray to the Almighty not to withhold 
His blessing from the new order of things and not to abandon our people in the 
days to come. 


In delivering this, message he could not do more than briefly express 
appreciation of the Royal House, its services to Pomerania, to Prussia, indeed 
to the whole of the German Fatherland, and at this point he broke down. A 
feeling of profound dismay fell on the people in that assembly, and I do not 


225 


think there was a single eye that was not wet with tears. As for myself, I broke 
down completely when the old gentleman tried to resume his story by 
informing us that we must now end this long war, because the war was lost, he 
said, and we were at the mercy of the victor. 


The Fatherland would have to bear heavy burdens in the future. We were 
to accept the terms of the Armistice and trust to the magnanimity of our former 
enemies. 


It was impossible for me to stay and listen any longer. Darkness 
surrounded me as I staggered and stumbled back to my ward and buried my 
aching head between the blankets and pillow. 


I had not cried since the day that I stood beside my mother’s grave. 
Whenever Fate dealt cruelly with me in my young days the spirit of 
determination within me grew stronger and stronger. 


During all those long years of war, when Death claimed many a true 
friend and comrade from our ranks, to me it would have appeared sinful to 
have uttered a word of complaint. Did they not die for Germany? 


And, finally, almost in the last few days of that titanic struggle, when the 
waves of poison-gas enveloped me and began to penetrate my eyes, the thought 
of becoming permanently blind unnerved me, but the voice of conscience cried 
out immediately—‘ You miserable fellow, would you start howling when there 
are thousands of others whose lot is a hundred times worse than yours?’ 


And so I accepted my misfortune in silence, realising that this was the 
only thing to be done and that personal suffering was nothing as compared with 
the misfortune of one’s country. 


All had been in vain. In vain all the sacrifices and privations, in vain the 
hunger and thirst for endless months, in vain those hours that was stuck to our 
posts though the fear of death gripped our souls, and in vain the deaths of two 
millions who fell in discharging their duty. 


Think of those hundreds of thousands who set out with hearts full of faith 
in their Fatherland, and never returned; ought not their graves to open, so that 
the spirits of those heroes bespattered with mud and blood might come home 
and take vengeance on those who had so despicably betrayed the greatest 
sacrifice which a man can make for his country? 


226 


Was it for this that the soldiers died in August and September 1914, for 
this that the volunteer regiments followed their older comrades in the autumn of 
the same year? 


Was it for this that those boys of seventeen years of age were mingled 
with the earth of Flanders? Was this the reason for the sacrifice which German 
mothers made for their Fatherland when, with heavy hearts, they said good-bye 
to their sons, who never returned? 


Had all this been done in order to enable a gang of despicable criminals 
to lay hands on the Fatherland? 


Was this, then, what the German soldier struggled for through sweltering 
heat and blinding snowstorm, enduring hunger and thirst and cold, fatigued 
from sleepless nights and endless marches? 


Was it for this that he lived through an inferno of artillery bombardments, 
lay gasping and choking during gas-attacks, neither flinching nor faltering, 
remembering only that it was his duty to defend the Fatherland against the 
enemy? 


Certainly those heroes also deserved the epitaph: “Traveller, when you 
come to Germany, tell the mother country that we lie here, true to the 
Fatherland and faithful unto death.” 


And at home? But—was this the only sacrifice that we had to consider? 
Was the Germany of the past a country of little worth? Did she not owe a 
certain duty to her own history? Were we still worthy to partake in the glory of 
the past? How could we justify this act to future generations? 


What a gang of despicable and depraved criminals! The more I tried then 
to gain an insight into the terrible events that had happened, the more did I bum 
with rage and shame. 


What was all the pain I suffered in my eyes compared with this tragedy? 


The following days were terrible to bear, and the nights still worse. I 
realised that all was lost. To depend on the mercy of the enemy was a precept 
which only fools or criminal liars could recommend. 


During those nights my hatred increased—hatred for the originators of 
this dastardly crime. 


Ded 


During the days which followed my own fate became clear to me. I was 
forced now to scoff at the thought of my personal future, which hitherto had 
been the cause of so much worry to me. 


Was it not ludicrous to think of building up anything on such a 
foundation? Finally, it also became clear to me that it was the inevitable that 
had happened, something which I had feared for a long time, though I really 
had not had the heart to believe it. 


Emperor Wilhelm II was the first German Emperor to offer the hand of 
friendship to the Marxist leaders, not suspecting that they were scoundrels 
without any sense of honour. 


While they held the imperial hand in one of theirs, the other was already 
feeling for the dagger. There is no such thing as coming to an understanding 
with the Jews. It must be a hard-and-fast ‘Either-Or.’ 


For my part I then decided that I would take up political work. 


228

230 


CHAPTER VII: THE BEGINNING OF MY 
POLITICAL ACTIVITIES 


Towards the end of November, I returned to Munich. I went to the depot 
of my regiment, which was now in, the hands of the Soldiers’ Councils. 


As the whole business was repulsive to me, I decided to leave as soon 
as I possibly could. With my faithful war-comrade, Schmiedt Ernst, I went to 
Traunstein and remained there until the camp was broken up. 


In March 1919, we were back again in Munich. The situation there could 
not last as it was. It tended irresistibly to a further extension of the Revolution. 


Eisner’s death served only to hasten this development and finally led to 
the dictatorship of the Councils, or, to put it more correctly, to a Jewish 
hegemony, which turned out to be transitory, but which was the original aim of 
those who had contrived the Revolution. 


At that juncture innumerable plans took shape in my mind. I spent whole 
days pondering on the problem of what could be done, but unfortunately every 
project had to give way before the hard fact that I was quite unknown and 
therefore did not have even, the first qualifications necessary for effective 
action. Later on I shall explain the reasons why I could not decide to join any 
of the parties then in existence. 


As the new Revolution began to run its course, my activities drew down 
upon me the ill-will of the Central Council. In the early morning of April 27th, 
1919, I was to have been arrested, but the three fellows who came to arrest me 
did not have the courage to face my rifle and withdrew empty-handed. 


A few days after the liberation of Munich I was ordered to appear before 
the Inquiry Commission which had been set up by the 2nd Infantry Regiment for 
the purpose of investigating revolutionary activities. That was my first 
incursion into the more or less political field. 


A few weeks later I received orders to attend a course of lectures which 
were being given to members of the Army. This course was meant to propagate 
certain fundamental principles on which the soldier could base his political 
ideas. 


231 


For me the advantage of this organisation was that 1t gave me a chance of 
meeting fellow-soldiers who were of the same way of thinking and with whom 
I could discuss the actual situation. 


We were all more or less firmly convinced that Germany could not be 
saved from imminent disaster by those who had participated in the November 
crime—that is to say, by the Centre and the Social Democrats, and also that the 
so-called Bourgeois-National group could not make good the damage that had 
been done, even if their intentions were of the best. 


Certain conditions necessary for the successful undertaking of such a task 
were not fulfilled. The years that followed have justified the opinions which 
we held at that time. 


In our small circle we discussed the project of forming a new party. The 
leading ideas which we then proposed were the same as those which were 
carried into effect afterwards, when the German Labour Party was founded. 


The name of the new movement which was to be founded should be such 
that, of itself, it would appeal to the masses of the people, for all our efforts 
would turn out vain and useless if this condition were lacking. That was the 
reason why we chose the name ‘Social Revolutionary Party,’ particularly 
because the social principles of our new organisation were indeed 
revolutionary. 


There was also a more fundamental reason. The attention which I had 
given to economic problems during my earlier years was more or less confined 
to considerations arising directly out of the social problem. 


Subsequently my outlook broadened as I came to study the German 
policy of alliance. This policy was very largely the result of an erroneous 
valuation of the economic situation, together with a confused notion as to the 
basis on which the future subsistence of the German people could be 
guaranteed. 


All these ideas were based on the principle that capital is exclusively 
the product of labour and that, just like labour, it was subject to all the factors 
which can hinder or promote human activity. 


Hence, from the national standpoint, the significance of capital depended 
on the greatness, freedom and power of the State, that is to say, of the nation, 
and it is this dependence alone which leads capital to promote the interests of 


22 


the State and the nation, from an instinct of self-preservation and for the sake of 
its own development. 


Consequently, the dependence of capital upon the independent and Free 
State would force it to defend the nation’s freedom, might, strength, etc. 


According to such principles the duty of the State towards capital would 
be comparatively simple and clear. Its only object would be to make sure that 
capital remained subservient to the State and did not allocate to itself the right 
to dominate national interests. 


Thus the State could confine its activities within the two following 
limits: on the one side, to assure a vital and independent system of national 
economy and, on the other, to safeguard the social rights of the workers. 
Previously, I did not recognise with adequate clearness the difference between 
that capital which is purely the product of creative labour, and the existence 
and nature of capital which is exclusively the result of financial speculation. 


Here I needed a stimulus to set my mind thinking in this direction, but 
that had hitherto been lacking. The requisite stimulus now came from one of the 
men who delivered lectures in the course I have already mentioned. This was 
Gottfried Feder. 


For the first time in my life, I heard a discussion which dealt with the 
principles of stock-exchange capital and capital which was used for loan 
activities. After hearing the first lecture delivered by Feder, the idea 
immediately came into my head that I had now found a way to establish one of 
the most essential prerequisites for the founding of a new party. 


To my mind, Feder’s merit consisted in the ruthless and trenchant way in 
which he described the speculative and political economic character of the 
capital used in stock exchange and loan transactions, laying bare the fact that 
this capital is always dependent on the payment of interest. 


In fundamental questions his statements were so full of common sense 
that even those who criticised him did not deny that au fond his ideas were 
sound, but they doubted whether it were possible to put these ideas into 
practice. To me, this seemed the strongest point in Feder’s teaching, though 
others considered it a weak point. 


It is not the business of him who lays down a theoretical programme to 
explain the various ways in which something can be put into practice. His task 


233 


is to deal with the problem as such; and he has, therefore, to look to the end 
rather than the means. 


The important question 1s whether an idea is fundamentally right or not. 
The question as to whether it may or may not be difficult to carry it out in 
practice is quite another matter. 


When a man, whose task it is to lay down the principles of a programme 
or policy, begins to busy himself with the question as to whether it is expedient 
and practical, instead of confining himself to a statement of the absolute truth, 
his work will cease to be a guiding star to those who are looking, for light and 
guidance, and will become merely a recipe for everyday life. 


The man who lays down the programme of a movement must consider 
only the goal. It is for the political leader to point out the way in which that 
goal may be reached. The thought of the former will, therefore, be determined 
by those truths that are everlasting, whereas the activity of the latter must 
always be guided by taking practical account of the circumstances in which 
those truths have to be carried into effect. 


The greatness of the one will depend on the absolute truth of his idea 
considered in the abstract; whereas that of the other will depend on whether or 
not he correctly judges the given realities and how they may be utilised under 
the guidance of the truths established by the former. 


The test of greatness as applied to a political leader is the success of his 
plans and his enterprises, which means his ability to reach the goal for which 
he sets out; whereas the final goal set up by the political philosopher can never 
be reached, for human thought may grasp truths and visualise ends which it 
sees with crystal clarity, though such ends can ever be completely attained, 
because human nature is weak and imperfect. 


The more an idea is correct in the abstract, and, the more comprehensive 
it therefore is, the smaller is the possibility of putting it into practice, at least 
as far as this depends on human beings. 


The significance of a political philosopher does not depend on the 
practical success of the plans he lays down, but rather on their absolute truth 
and the influence they exert on the progress of mankind. 


If it were otherwise, the founders of religions could not be considered as 
the greatest men who have ever lived, because their moral aims will never be 


234 


completely or even approximately carried out in practice. 


Even that religion which 1s called the religion of brotherly love is 
actually no more than a faint reflex of the will of its sublime Founder, but its 
significance lies in the orientation which it endeavoured to give to human 
civilisation and human virtue and morals. 


This very wide difference between the functions of a political 
philosopher and a practical political leader is the reason why the 
qualifications necessary for both functions are scarcely ever found combined 
in the same person. 


This applies especially to the so-called successful politician of the 
lesser kind, whose activity is indeed hardly more than that of practising the art 
of accomplishing the possible, as Bismarck modestly defined the art of politics 
in general. 


If such a politician resolutely avoids great ideas, his success will be all 
the easier to attain; it will be attained more expeditiously, and will frequently 
be more tangible. By reason of this very fact, however, such success is doomed 
to futility and sometimes does not even, survive the death of its author. 


Generally speaking, the work of such politicians is without significance 
for the following generation, because their temporary success was based on the 
expediency of avoiding all really great decisive problems and ideas which 
would hold good for future generations likewise. 


To pursue ideals which will still be of value and significance for the 
future is generally not a very profitable undertaking and he who follows sucha 
course is only very rarely understood by the masses of the people, who find the 
price of beer and milk a more persuasive index of political values than far- 
sighted plans for the future, the realisation of which can only take place later 
on and the advantages of which can be reaped only by posterity. 


Because of a certain vanity, which is always one of the blood relations 
of unintelligence, the general run of politicians will always eschew those 
schemes for the future which are really difficult to put into practice; and they 
will avoid them in order that they may not lose the immediate favour of the 
mob. 


The importance and the success of such politicians belong exclusively to 
the present and will be of no consequence for the future, but that does not 


230 


worry small-minded people who are quite content with momentary results. 


The position of the constructive political philosopher is quite different. 
The importance of his work must always be fudged from the standpoint of the 
future; and he is frequently described by the word Weltfremder, or dreamer. 


While the ability of the politician consists in mastering the art of the 
possible, the founder of a political system belongs to those who are said to 
please the gods only because they wish for and demand the impossible. They 
will always have to renounce contemporary fame, but if their ideas be 
immortal, posterity will acclaim them. 


Within long spans of human progress it may occasionally happen that the 
practical politician and political philosopher are one. The more intimate this 
union is, the greater will be the obstacles which the activity of the politician 
will have to encounter. 


Such a man does not labour for the purpose of satisfying demands that 
are obvious to every Philistine, but he reaches out towards ends which can be 
understood only by the few. His life is torn asunder by hatred and love. The 
protest of his contemporaries, who do not understand the man, is in conflict 
with the recognition of posterity, for whom he also works. 


The greater the work which a man does for the future, the less will he be 
appreciated by his contemporaries. His struggle will accordingly be the more 
severe, and his success the rarer. When, in the course of centuries, such a man 
appears and is blessed with success, then, towards the end of his days, he may 
have a faint prevision of his future fame. 


Such great men are only the Marathon runners of history; the laurels of 
contemporary fame are only for the brow of the dying hero. 


The great protagonists are those who fight for their ideas and ideals 
despite the fact that they receive no recognition at the hands of their 
contemporaries. They are the men whose memories will be enshrined in the 
hearts of future generations. 


It seems then as if each individual felt it his duty to make retrospective 
atonement for the wrong which great men have suffered at the hands of their 
contemporaries. Their lives and their work are then studied with touching and 
grateful admiration. 


236 


Especially in dark days of distress, such men have the power of healing 
broken hearts and of raising the despairing spirit of a people. To this group 
belong not only the genuinely great statesmen but all the great reformers as 
well. Besides Frederick the Great we have men such as Martin Luther and 
Richard Wagner. 


When I heard Gottfried Feder’s first lecture on ‘The Abolition of the 
Thraldom of Interest,’ I understood immediately that here was a truth of 
transcendental importance for the future of the German people. 


The absolute separation of stock-exchange capital from the economic life 
of the nation would make it possible to oppose the process of 
internationalisation in German business, without at the same time attacking 
capital as such, for to do this would jeopardise the foundations of our national 
independence. 


I clearly saw what was developing in Germany and I realised then that 
the stiffest fight we would have to wage would not be against an alien enemy, 
but against international capital. In Feder’s speech I found an effective slogan 
for our coming struggle. 


Here again, later events proved how correct was the impression we then 
had. The fools among our bourgeois politicians no longer mock at us on this 
score, for even those politicians now see if they would speak the truth that 
international stock-exchange capital was not only the chief instigating factor in 
bringing about the war, but that, now the war is over, it serves to turn the peace 
into a hell. 


The struggle against international finance capital and loan capital has 
become one of the most important points in the programme on which the 
German nation has based its fight for economic freedom and independence. 


Regarding the objections raised by so-called practical people, the 
following answer must suffice. All apprehension concerning the fearful 
economic consequences that would follow the abolition of the thraldom that 
results from interest-capital are ill-timed, for, in the first place, the economic 
principles hitherto followed have proved fatal to the interests of the German 
people. 


The attitude adopted when the question of preserving our national 
existence arose, vividly recalls similar advice once given by experts—the 


235i) 


Bavarian Medical College, for example—on the question of introducing 
railroads. 


The fears expressed by that august body of experts were not realised. 
Those who travelled in the coaches of the new ‘Steam-horse’ did not suffer 
from vertigo. Those who looked on did not become ill and the hoardings which 
were to have been erected to conceal the new invention, were never put up. 


Only the blinkers which obscure the vision of the would-be ‘experts’ 
have remained, and this will always be so. 


In the second place, the following must be borne in mind. Any idea may 
be a source of danger if it is looked upon as an end in itself, when in reality it 
is only the means to an end. For me, and for all genuine National Socialists, 
there is only one slogan: People and Fatherland. 


What we have to fight for is the necessary security for the existence and 
increase of our race and people, the subsistence of our children and the 
maintenance of our racial stock unmixed, the freedom and independence of the 
Fatherland, so that our people may be enabled to fulfil the mission assigned to 
it by the Creator. 


All ideas and ideals, all teaching and all knowledge, must serve these 
ends. It is from this standpoint that everything must be examined and turned to 
practical use, or else discarded. 


Thus, a theory can never become a mere dead dogma, since everything 
must serve the purpose of guaranteeing our existence. 


The conclusions arrived at by Gottfried Feder determined me to make a 
fundamental study of a question with which I had hitherto not been very 
familiar. 


I began to study again and thus it was that I first came to understand 
perfectly what was the substance and purpose of the life-work of the Jew, Karl 
Marx. 


His Capital became intelligible to me for the first time, and in the light 
of it I now clearly understood the fight of the Social Democrats against 
national economics, a fight which was to prepare the ground for the hegemony 
of a real international and stock-exchange capital. 


238 


In another direction also, this course of lectures had important 
consequences for me. One day I put my name down as wishing to take part in 
the discussion. Another of the participants thought that he would break a lance 
for the Jews and entered into a lengthy defence of them. 


This aroused my opposition. An overwhelming number of those who 
attended the lecture course supported my views. The consequence of it all was 
that, a few days later, I was assigned to a regiment then stationed in Munich 
and given a position there as ‘instruction officer.’ 


At that time the spirit of discipline was rather weak among the troops 
which were still suffering from the after-effects of the period when the 
Soldiers’ Councils were in control. Only gradually and carefully could a new 
spirit of military discipline and obedience be introduced in place of ‘voluntary 
obedience,’ a term which had been used to express the ideal of military 
discipline under Kurt Eisner’s higgledy-piggledy regime. 


The soldiers had to be taught to think and feel ina national and patriotic 
way. In these two directions lay my future line of action. 


I took up my work with the greatest zeal and devotion. Here I was 
presented with an opportunity of speaking before quite a large audience. I was 
now able to confirm what I had hitherto merely felt, namely, that I had a talent 
for public speaking. 


My voice had become so much better that I could be well understood, at 
least in all parts of the small hall where the soldiers assembled. No task could 
have been more pleasing to me than this one; for now, before being 
demobilised, I was in a position to render useful service to an institution which 
had become infinitely dear to my heart, namely, the Army. 


I am able to state that my talks were successful. During the course of my 
lectures I have led back hundreds and even thousands of my fellow-countrymen 
to their people and their Fatherland. I ‘nationalised’ those troops and by so 
doing I helped to restore general discipline. 


Here again I made the acquaintance of several comrades whose line of 
thought was similar to my own and who later became members of the first 
group out of which the new movement developed.

CHAPTER IX: THE GERMAN LABOUR PARTY 


One day I received an order from my superior officer to investigate the 
nature of an association which was apparently political. It called itself ‘The 
German Labour Party’ and was soon to hold a meeting at which Gottfried 
Feder would speak. 


I was ordered to attend this meeting and report on the nature of the 
association. The spirit of curiosity in which the army authorities then regarded 
political parties can be very well understood. 


The Revolution had granted the soldiers the right to take an active part in 
politics and it was particularly those with the smallest experience who had 
availed themselves of this privilege, but not until the Centre and the Social 
Democratic Parties were reluctantly forced to recognise that the sympathies of 
the soldiers had turned away from the revolutionary parties towards the 
national movement and the national reawakening, did they feel obliged to 
withdraw from the Army the right to vote, and to ban all political activity 
among the soldiers. 


The fact that the centre and Marxism had adopted this policy was 
instructive, because if they had not thus curtailed the ‘rights of the citizen’—as 
they described the political rights of the soldiers after the Revolution—the 
government which had been established in November 1918 would have been 
overthrown within a few years and the dishonour and disgrace of the nation 
would not have been further prolonged. 


At that time the soldiers were on the point of ridding the nation of the 
vampires and fawners who served the cause of the Entente in the interior of the 
country, but the fact that the so-called ‘national’ parties voted enthusiastically 
for the doctrinaire policy of the criminals who organised the revolution in 
November 1918 also helped to render the Army ineffectual as an instrument of 
national restoration, and thus showed once again what might be the outcome of 
the purely abstract notions imbibed by these most gullible people. 


The minds of the bourgeois middle classes had become so fossilised that 
they sincerely believed the Army could once again become what it had 
previously been, namely, a rampart of German valour, while the Centre Party 
and the Marxists intended only to extract the poisonous tooth of nationalism, 


242 


without which an army must always remain just a polite force, but can never be 
in the position of a military organisation capable of fighting against an outside 
enemy. 


This truth was sufficiently proved by subsequent events. Or did our 
‘national’ politicians believe, after all, that the development of our army could 
be other than national? This belief might be possible and could be explained 
by the fact that, during the war, they had been not soldiers, but merely talkers. 


In other words, they were parliamentarians, and, as such, they did not 
have the slightest idea of what was going on in the hearts of those men who 
remembered the greatness of their own past and also remembered that they had 
once been the first soldiers in the world. 


I decided to attend the meeting of this party which had hitherto been 
entirely unknown to me. When I arrived that evening in the guest-room of the 
former Sterneckerbrau—which has now become a place of historical 
significance for us—I found some twenty or twenty-five persons present, most 
of them belonging to the lower classes. 


The theme of Feder’s lecture was already familiar to me, for I had heard 
it in the lecture course of which I have spoken. I could, therefore, concentrate 
my attention on the society itself. 


The impression it made upon me was neither good nor bad. I felt that 
here was just another one of those many new societies which were being 
formed at that time. In those days everybody felt called upon to found a new 
party whenever he felt displeased with the course of events and had lost 
confidence in all the parties already existing. 


Thus it was that new associations sprouted up all round, to disappear 
just as quickly, without exercising any effect or making any impression 
whatsoever. Generally speaking, the founders of such associations did not have 
the slightest idea of what it means to bring together a number of people for the 
foundation of a party or a movement. 


Therefore, these associations disappeared because of their woeful lack 
of anything like an adequate grasp of the essentials of the situation. 


My opinion of the ‘German Labour Party’ was not very different after I 
had listened to their proceedings for about two hours. I was glad when Feder 
finally came to a close. I had observed enough and was just about to leave 


243 


when it was announced that anybody who wished was free to take part in the 
discussion. 


Thereupon, I decided to remain, but the discussion seemed to proceed 
without anything of vital importance being mentioned, when suddenly a 
‘professor’ commenced to speak. 


He began by throwing doubt on the accuracy of what Feder had said, and 
then, after Feder had replied very effectively, the professor suddenly took up 
his position on what he called ‘the basis of facts, but before this he 
recommended the young party most urgently to introduce the secession of 
Bavaria from Prussia as one of the leading points in its programme. 


In the most self-assured way, this man kept on insisting that German- 
Austria would join Bavaria and that the peace would then function much better. 
He made other similarly extravagant statements. 


At this juncture I felt bound to ask for permission to speak and to tell the 
learned gentleman what I thought. The result was that the honourable gentleman 
who had last spoken slipped out of the room, like a whipped cur, without 
uttering a sound. 


While I was speaking the audience listened with an expression of 
surprise on their faces. When I was just about to say good-night to the 
assembly and to leave, a man came after me quickly and introduced himself. I 
did not grasp the name correctly, but he placed in my hand a little book which 
was obviously a political pamphlet, and asked me very earnestly to read it. 


I was quite pleased, because, in this way, I could get to know about this 
association without having to attend its tiresome meetings. Moreover, this man, 
who had the appearance of a workman, made a good impression on me. 
Thereupon, I left the hall. 


At that time, I was living in one of the barracks of the 2nd Infantry 
Regiment. I had a little room which still bore unmistakable traces of the 
Revolution. 


During the day I was mostly out, at the quarters of the Light Infantry 
Regiment No. 41, or else attending meetings or lectures, held at the quarters of 
some other unit. I spent only the night at the barracks where I lodged. 


Since I usually woke up about five o’clock every morning, I got into the 


244 


habit of amusing myself with watching little mice which scampered about my 
small room. 


I used to place a few pieces of hard bread or crust on the floor and 
watch the funny little creatures playing around and enjoying themselves with 
these delicacies. I had suffered so many privations in my life that I well knew 
what hunger was and could only too well picture to myself the pleasure these 
little creatures were experiencing. 


On the morning after the meeting I have mentioned, it happened that about 
five o’clock I lay fully awake in bed, watching the mice playing and vying with 
each other. As I was not able to go to sleep again, I suddenly remembered the 
pamphlet that one of the workers had given me at the meeting. It was a small 
pamphlet of which this worker was the author. 


In his little book he described how his mind had thrown off the shackles 
of the Marxist and trade-union phraseology, and how he had come back to the 
nationalist ideals. That was the reason why he had entitled his little book, My 
Political Awakening. 


The pamphlet secured my attention the moment I began to read, and I 
read it with interest to the end. The process here described was similar to that 
which I had experienced in my own case twelve years previously. 


Unconsciously, my own experiences began to stir again in my mind. 
During that day my thoughts returned several times to what I had read, but I 
finally decided to give the matter no further attention. 


A week or so later, however, I received a postcard which informed me, 
to my astonishment, that I had been admitted to the German Labour Party. I was 
asked to answer this communication and to intend a meeting of the party 
committee on Wednesday next. 


This manner of getting members rather amazed me, and I did not know 
whether to be angry or laugh at it. I had no intention of entering a party already 
in existence, but wanted to found one of my own. 


Such an invitation as I had now received, I looked upon as entirely out of 
the question for me. I was about to send a written reply when my curiosity got 
the better of me, and I decided to attend the gathering on the date assigned, so 
that I might expound my principles to these gentlemen in person. 


245 


Wednesday came. The tavern in which the meeting was to take place was 
the Altes Rosenbad in the Herrnstrasse, into which apparently only an 
occasional guest wandered. 


This was not very surprising in the year 1919, when the bill of fare even 
at the larger restaurants was very modest and scanty and thus not very 
attractive to clients, but I had never before heard of this restaurant. 


I went through the badly-lighted tap-room, where not a single guest was 
to be seen, and searched for the door which led to the side room, and there I 
found the ‘meeting.’ 


Under the dim light shed by a grimy gas-lamp, I could see four young 
people sitting around a table, one of them being the author of the pamphlet. He 
greeted me cordially and welcomed me as a new member of the German 
Labour Party. 


I was somewhat taken aback. On being informed that, actually, the ‘Reich 
chairman’ of the party had not yet come, I decided that I would keep back my 
own explanation for the time being. 


Finally the chairman appeared. He was the man who had been chairman 
at the meeting held in the Sterneckerbrau, when Feder had spoken. 


My curiosity was stimulated anew and I| sat waiting for what was going 
to happen. Now I got at least as far as learning the names of the gentlemen 
present. The Reich chairman of the association was a certain Herr Harrer and 
the chairman for the Munich district was Anton Drexler. 


The minutes of the previous meeting were read out and a vote of 
confidence in the secretary was passed. Then came the treasurer’s report. The 
society possessed a total fund of seven marks and fifty pfennigs, whereupon the 
treasurer was assured that he had the confidence of the members. This was 
now inserted in the minutes. Then letters of reply, which had been drafted by 
the chairman, were read; first, to a letter received from Kiel, then to one from 
Dusseldorf and finally to one from Berlin. All three replies received the 
approval of all present. 


Then the incoming letters were read—one from Berlin, one from 
Dusseldorf and one from Kiel. The reception of these letters seemed to cause 
great satisfaction. This increasing bulk of correspondence was taken as the 
best and most obvious sign of the growing importance of the German Labour 


246 


Party. 


And then? Well, there followed a long discussion of the replies which 
should be given to these newly received letters, It was all very awful. This 
was the worst kind of parish-pump clubbism. And was I supposed to become a 
member of such a club? 


The question of new members was next discussed that is to say, the 
question of catching me in the trap. I now began to ask questions. But I found 
that, apart from a few general principles, there was nothing—no programme, 
no pamphlet, nothing at all in print, no card of membership, not even a party 
stamp, nothing but obvious good faith and good intentions. 


I no longer felt inclined to laugh; for what else was all this but a typical 
sign of the most complete perplexity and deepest despair concerning all other 
political parties, their programmes, views and activities? 


The feeling which had induced those few young people to join in what 
seemed such a ridiculous enterprise was nothing but the call of the inner voice 
which told them—though more intuitively than consciously—that the whole 
party system as it had hitherto existed was not the kind of force that could 
restore the German nation or repair the damage that had been done to the 
German people by those who had hitherto controlled the internal affairs of the 
nation. 


I quickly read through the list of principles laid down by the party. These 
principles were stated on typewritten sheets. Here again I found evidence of 
the spirit of longing and searching, but no sign whatever of a knowledge of the 
conflict that had to be fought. 


I myself had experienced the feelings which inspired these people. It 
was the longing for a movement which should be more than a party, in the 
hitherto accepted meaning of that word. 


When I returned to my room in the barracks that evening, I had formed a 
definite opinion on this association and I was facing the most difficult problem 
of my life. Should I join this party or refuse? 


From the common-sense point of view, I felt I ought to refuse, but my 
feelings troubled me. The more I tried to prove to myself how senseless this 
club was, on the whole, the more did my feelings incline me to favour it. 


247 


During the days which followed I was restless. I began to consider all 
the pros and cons. I had long ago decided to take an active part in politics. The 
fact that I could do so only through a new movement was quite clear to me, but 
I had hitherto lacked the impulse to take concrete action. 


I am not one of those people who will begin something to-day just to 
give it up the next day for the sake of something new. That was the main reason 
which made it so difficult for me to decide to join something newly founded; 
for this must become the real fulfilment of everything I dreamt, or else it had 
better not be started at all. 


I knew that such a decision would bind me for ever and then there could 
be no turning back. For me there could be no idle dallying, but only a cause to 
be championed ardently. I had already an instinctive feeling against people 
who took up everything, but never carried anything through to the end. 


I loathed these Jacks-of-all trades, and considered the activities of such 
people to be worse than if they were to remain entirely quiescent. 


Fate herself now seemed to point a finger that showed me the way. I 
should never have entered one of the big parties already in existence and shall 
explain my reasons for this later on. 


This ludicrous little formation, with its handful of members, seemed to 
have the unique advantage of not yet being fossilised into an ‘organisation’ and 
still offered a chance for real personal activity on the part of the individual. 


Here it might still be possible to do some effective work, and, as the 
movement was still small, one could all the more easily give it the required 
shape. 


Here it was still possible to determine the character of the movement, the 
aims to be achieved and the road to be taken, which would have been 
impossible in the case of any of the big parties already existing. 


The longer I reflected on the problem, the more my conviction grew, that 
just such a small movement would best serve as an instrument to prepare the 
way for the national resurgence, but that this could never be done by the 
political parliamentary parties which were too firmly attached to obsolete 
ideas or had an interest in supporting the new regime. 


What had to be proclaimed here was a new Weltanschauung and not a 


248 


new election cry. It was, however, infinitely difficult to decide on putting the 
intention into practice. What were the qualifications which I could bring to the 
accomplishment of such a task? 


The fact that I was poor and without resources would, in my opinion, be 
the easiest to bear, but the fact that I was utterly unknown raised a more 
difficult problem. I was only one of the millions whom chance allows to exist 
or to cease to exist, whom even their next-door neighbours will not consent to 
know. 


Another difficulty arose from the fact that I had not gone through the 
regular school curriculum. The so-called ‘intellectuals’ still look down with 
infinite superciliousness on anyone who has not been through the prescribed 
schools and allowed them to pump the necessary knowledge into him. 


The question, What can a man do? is never asked, but rather, what has he 
learned? ‘Educated’ people look upon any imbecile who is plastered with a 
number of academic certificates as being superior to the ablest young fellow 
who lacks these precious documents. 


I could therefore easily imagine how this ‘educated’ world would 
receive me and I was wrong only in so far as I then believed men to be for the 
most part better than they proved to be in the cold light of reality. 


Because of their being as they, are, the few exceptions stand out all the 
more conspicuously. I learned more and more to distinguish between those 
who will always be at school and those who will one day come to know 
something. 


After two days of careful brooding and reflection I became convinced 
that I must take the contemplated step. It was the most fateful decision of my 
life. No retreat was possible. 


Thus I declared myself ready to accept the membership tendered me by 
the German Labour Party and received a provisional certificate of membership 
which bore the number seven.

251 


CHAPTER X: THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECOND 
REICH 


The depth of a fall is always measured by the difference between the 
level of the original position from which a body has fallen and that in which it 
now lies. 


The same holds good for nations and States. The matter of greatest 
importance here is the height of the original level, or rather the greatest height 
that had been attained before the descent began. 


Therefore, the original position is of paramount importance, and only the 
fall or collapse of that which is capable of rising above the general level, can 
impress the beholder. 


The collapse of the Second Reich was all the more bewildering for those 
who could ponder over it and feel the effect of it in their hearts, because the, 
Reich had fallen from a height which can hardly be imagined in these days of 
misery and humiliation. 


The Second Reich was founded in circumstances of such dazzling 
splendour that the whole nation had become entranced and exalted by it. 
Following an unparalleled series of victories, that Reich was handed over as 
the guerdon of immortal heroism to the children and grandchildren of the 
heroes. 


Whether they were fully conscious of it or not, does not matter, the 
Germans felt that this Reich, which did not owe its existence to the 
machinations of parliamentary factions, was superior to the great majority of 
States by reason of the nobler circumstances that had accompanied its 
establishment. 


When its foundations were laid, the accompanying music was not the 
chatter of parliamentary debates, but the thunder and clash of war along the 
battle-front that encircled Paris. 


It was thus that an act of statesmanship was accomplished whereby the 
Germans, princes as well as people, established the future Reich and restored 
the symbol of the Imperial Crown. Bismarck’s State was not founded on 


252 


treason and assassination by deserters and shirkers, but by the regiments that 
had fought at, the front. 


This unique birth and baptism of fire sufficed of themselves to surround 
the Second Reich with an aureole of historical splendour such as few of the 
older States could claim. 


What a period of prosperity then began! A position of independence in 
regard to the outside world guaranteed the means of livelihood at home. The 
nation increased in numbers and in worldly wealth. 


The honour of the State and thereby the honour of the people as a whole 
were secured and protected by an Army which was the most striking proof of 
the difference between this new Reich and the old German Confederation. 


The downfall of the Second Reich and the German nation has been so 
profound that everyone seems to have been dumbfounded and rendered 
incapable of feeling the significance of this downfall or reflecting on it. 


It seems as if people were utterly unable to picture in their minds the 
heights to which the Reich formerly attained, so visionary and unreal appears 
the greatness and splendour of those days in contrast to tie misery of the 
present. 


Bearing this in mind, we can understand why and how people become so 
dazed when they try to look back, to the sublime past that they forget to look for 
the symptoms of the great collapse which must certainly have been present in 
some form or other. 


Naturally this applies only to those for whom Germany was more than 
merely a place of abode and a source of livelihood. These are the only people 
who have been able to feel the present conditions as really catastrophic, 
whereas others have considered these conditions as the fulfilment of what they 
had looked forward to and hitherto silently wished. 


The symptoms of future collapse were definitely to be perceived in those 
earlier days, although very few made any attempt to deduce a practical lesson 
from their significance, but this is now a greater necessity than it ever was 
before, for just as bodily ailments can be cured only when their origin has been 
diagnosed, so also political disease can be treated only when it has been 
diagnosed. 


253 


It is obvious, of course, that the external symptoms of any disease can be 
more readily detected than its internal causes, for these symptoms strike the 
eye more readily. 


This is also the reason why so many people recognise only external 
effects and mistake them for causes. Indeed, they will sometimes try to deny the 
existence of such causes, and that is why the majority of people among us 
recognise the German collapse only in the prevailing economic distress and the 
results that have followed therefrom. 


Almost everyone has to bear his share of this burden and that is why 
each one looks on the economic catastrophe as the cause of the present 
deplorable state of affairs. 


The broad masses of the people see little of the cultural, political, and 
moral background of this collapse. Many of them completely lack both the 
necessary feeling and the powers of understanding. 


That the masses of the people should thus estimate the causes of 
Germany’s downfall is quite understandable, but the fact that intelligent 
sections of the community regard the German collapse primarily as an 
economic catastrophe, and consequently think that a cure for it may be found in 
an economic solution, seems to me to be the reason why hitherto no 
improvement has been brought about. 


No improvement can be brought about until it is understood that 
economics play only a secondary role, while the main part is played by 
political, moral, and racial factors. 


Only when this is understood will it be possible to comprehend the 
causes of the present evils and consequently to find the ways and means of 
remedying them. 


Therefore, the question of why Germany really collapsed is one of the 
most urgent significance, especially for a political movement which aims at 
overcoming this disaster. 


In scrutinising the past with a view to discovering the causes of the 
German break-up, it is necessary to be careful lest we may be unduly 
impressed by external results that readily strike the eye and thus ignore the less 
manifest causes of these results. 


254 


The most facile, and therefore the most generally accepted way of 
accounting for the present misfortune, is to say that it is the result of a lost war, 
and that this is the real cause of the present distress. 


Probably there are many who honestly believe in this absurd 
explanation, but there are many more in whose mouths it is a deliberate and 
conscious falsehood. This applies to all those who are now feeding at the 
government troughs, for the prophets of the Revolution again and again 
declared to the people that the result of the war would be immaterial to the 
great masses. 


On the contrary, they solemnly assured the public that it was high finance 
which was principally interested in a victorious outcome of this gigantic 
struggle between the nations, but that the German people and the German 
workers had no interest whatsoever therein. 


Indeed, the apostles of world conciliation habitually asserted that, far 
from any German downfall, the opposite was bound to take place—namely, the 
resurgence of the German people—once ‘militarism’ had been crushed. 


Did not these self-same circles sing the praises of the Entente and did 
they not also lay the whole blame for the sanguinary struggle on Germany? 


Would they have succeeded in doing so, had they not put forward the 
theory that a military defeat would have no political consequences for the 
German people? Was not the whole Revolution dressed up in the pretty phrase 
that, since it would check the victorious advance of the German banners, the 
German people would thus be assured of its liberty both at home and abroad? 
Is not that so, you miserable, lying rascals? 


That kind of impudence which is typical of the Jews was necessary in 
order to proclaim the defeat of the Army as the cause of the German collapse, 
indeed the Berlin Vorwarts, that organ and mouthpiece of sedition, wrote on 
this occasion that the German nation should not be permitted to bring home its 
banners in triumph. Yet our collapse is attributed to the military defeat. 


Of course it would be out of the question to enter into an argument with 
these liars who deny one moment what they said the moment before. I should 
waste no further words on them were it not for the fact that there are many 
thoughtless people who repeat all this parrot-fashion, without being 
necessarily inspired by any evil motives. 


255 


But the observations I am making here are also meant for our fighting 
followers, seeing that nowadays one’s spoken words are often forgotten and 
their meaning distorted. 


The assertion that the loss of the war was the cause of the German 
collapse can best be answered as follows: 


It is admittedly a fact that the loss of the war was of tragic importance 
for the future of our country, but that loss was not in itself a cause. It was rather 
the consequence of other causes. 


That a disastrous ending to this life and death conflict must have 
involved catastrophes in its train was clearly seen by everyone of insight who 
could think in a straightforward manner, but unfortunately there were also 
people whose powers of understanding seemed to fail them at that critical 
moment. 


There were other people who had first questioned that truth and then 
altogether denied it, and there were people who, after their secret desire had 
been fulfilled, were suddenly faced with the state of affairs, that resulted from 
their own collaboration. 


Such people are responsible for the collapse, and not the lost war, 
though they now want to attribute everything to this. As a matter of fact, the 
loss of the war was a result of their activities and not the result of bad 
leadership, as they would now like to maintain. 


Our enemies were not cowards. They also knew how to die. From the 
very first day of the war they outnumbered the German Army, and the arsenals 
and armament factories of the whole world were at their disposal for the 
replenishment of military equipment. 


Indeed, it is universally admitted that the German victories, which had 
been steadily won during four years of warfare against the whole world, were 
(apart, of course, from the heroism of the troops, and the magnificent 
organisation) solely due to the German military leadership. 


That organisation and leadership of the German Army was the most 
mighty thing that the world has ever seen. Any shortcomings which became 
evident were humanly unavoidable. The collapse of that Army was not the 
cause of our present distress. It was itself the consequence of ether faults, but 
this consequence in its turn ushered in a further collapse, which was more 


256 


obvious. 


That such was actually the case can be shown as follows: Must a 
military defeat necessarily lead to such a complete overthrow of the State and 
the nation? 


Whenever has this been the result of an unfortunate, lost war? 
Are nations in fact ever ruined by a lost war and by that alone? 


The answer to this question can be briefly stated by referring to the fact 
that military defeats are the result of internal decay, cowardice, want of 
character, and are a retribution for such things. 


If such were not the case, then a military defeat would lead to a national 
resurgence and bring the nation to a higher pitch of effort. 


A military defeat is not the tombstone of national life. History affords 
innumerable examples to confirm the truth of that statement. 


Unfortunately, Germany’s military overthrow was not an undeserved 
catastrophe, but a well-merited punishment which was in the nature of an 
eternal retribution. 


This defeat was more than deserved by us, for it represented the greatest 
external phenomenon of decomposition among a series of internal phenomena, 
which, although they were visible, were not recognised by the majority of the 
people, who follow the tactics of the ostrich and see only what they want to 
See; 


Let us examine the symptoms that were evident in Germany at the time 
that the German people accepted this defeat. Is it not true that in several circles 
the misfortunes of the Fatherland were even joyfully welcomed in the most 
shameful manner? 


Who could act in such a way without thereby meriting vengeance for his 
attitude? Were there not people who went even further and boasted that they 
had gone to the extent of weakening the front and causing a collapse? 


Therefore, it was not the enemy who brought this disgrace upon us, but 
rather our own countrymen. If they suffered misfortune for it afterwards, was 
that misfortune undeserved? 


25] 


Was there ever a case in history where a people declared itself guilty of 
a war, and that even against its conscience and its better judgment? 


No, and again no. In the manner in which the German nation reacted to its 
defeat we can see that the real cause of our collapse must be looked for 
elsewhere and not in the purely military loss of a few positions or the failure 
of an offensive, for if the front as such had given way and thus brought about a 
national disaster, then the German nation would have accepted the defeat in 
quite another spirit. 


It would have borne the subsequent misfortune with clenched teeth, or it 
would have been overwhelmed by sorrow. 


Regret and fury against an enemy into whose hands victory had been 
given by a chance event or the decree of Fate would have filled the hearts of 
the people, and in that case the nation, following the example of the Roman 
Senate, would have faced the defeated legions on their return and expressed 
their thanks for the sacrifices that had been made and would have urged them 
not to lose faith in the Reich. 


Even the capitulation would have been signed under the sway of calm 
reason, while the heart would have beaten in the hope of the coming revanche. 


That is the reception that would have been given to a military defeat 
which had to be attributed only to the adverse decree of Fortune. There would 
have been neither joy-making nor dancing. 


Cowardice would not have been boasted of, and the defeat would not 
have been honoured. On returning from the front, the troops would not have 
been mocked at, and the colours would not have been dragged in the dust, but 
above all, that disgraceful state of affairs, could never have arisen which 
induced a British officer, Colonel Repington, to declare with scorn, “Every 
third German is a traitor.” 


No, in sucha case this plague would never have assumed the proportions 
of a veritable flood, which, for the past five years, has smothered every vestige 
of respect for the German nation in the outside world. 


This shows only too clearly how false it is to say that the loss of the war 
was the cause of the German break-up. The military defeat was in itself but the 
consequence of a whole series of morbid symptoms and their causes which had 
become active in, the German nation before the war broke out. 


258 


The collapse was the first catastrophic consequence, visible to all, of 
how traditions and national morale had been poisoned and how the instinct of 
self-preservation had degenerated. These were the preliminary causes which, 
for many years, had been undermining the foundations of the nation and the 
Reich. 


It remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood, 
and their fighting comrades, the Marxists, to impute responsibility for the 
downfall precisely to the man who alone had shown superhuman will-power 
and energy in his, effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and 
to save the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. 


By placing responsibility for the loss of the World War on the shoulders 
of Ludendorff, they took away the weapon of moral right from the only 
adversary dangerous enough to be likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of 
the Fatherland to justice. 


All this was inspired by the principle which is quite true in itself—that 
in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad 
masses of a nation are always more easily corruptible in the deeper strata of 
their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily had, and thus in the 
primitive simplicity of their minds they are readily fall victims to the big lie 
than to the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters, 
but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehood. 


It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and 
they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth 
so infamously. 


Even though the facts which prove this to be so are put clearly before 
them, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may 
be some other explanation, for the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces 
behind it, even after it has been nailed down—a fact which all expert liars in 
this world and all who conspire together in the art of lying know only too well 
and exploit in the basest manner. 


From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any 
others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited. 


Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are 
a religious community, whereas in reality they are a race? 


259 


And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced 
has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and 
exactly true. He called the Jew “the great master of lies.” 


Those who do not realise the truth of that statement, or do not wish to 
believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in helping truth to prevail. 


We may regard it as a great stroke of fortune for the German nation that 
its period of lingering suffering was so suddenly curtailed and transformed into 
such a terrible catastrophe, for if things had gone on as they were, the nation 
would, more slowly but more surely, have been ruined. 


The disease would have become chronic; whereas, in the acute form of 
the disaster, it at least showed itself clearly to the eyes of a considerable 
number of observers. 


It was not by accident that man conquered the black plague more easily 
than he has conquered tuberculosis. The first appeared in terrifying waves of 
death that shook the whole of mankind, the other advances insidiously; the first 
induced terror, the other gradual indifference. 


The result is, however, that men opposed the first with all the energy of 
which they were capable, whilst they try to arrest tuberculosis by feeble 
means. Thus man has mastered the black plague, while tuberculosis still gets 
the better of him. 


The same applies to diseases in nations. As long as these diseases are 
not of a catastrophic character, the population will slowly accustom itself to 
them and later succumb. 


It is then a stroke of luck—although a bitter one—when Fate decides to 
interfere in this slow process of decay and suddenly brings the victim face to 
face with the final stage of the disease. More often than not the result of a 
catastrophe is that a cure is at once undertaken and carried through with rigid 
determination, but even in such a case, the essential preliminary condition is 
always the recognition of the internal causes which have given rise to the 
disease in question. 


The important question here is the differentiation of the root causes from 
the circumstances developing out of them. This becomes all the more difficult 
the longer the germs of disease remain in the national body and the longer they 
are allowed to become an integral part of that body. 


260 


It may easily happen that, as time goes on, it will become so difficult to 
recognise certain definite virulent poisons as such that they are accepted as 
belonging to the national being, or they are merely tolerated as a necessary 
evil, so that drastic attempts to locate those alien germs are not held to be 
necessary. 


During the long period of peace prior to the last war, certain evils were 
apparent here and there although, with one or two exception, very little effort 
was made to discover their origin. 


Here again, these exceptions were primarily those phenomena in the 
economic life of the nation which were more apparent to the individual rather 
than the evil conditions existing in a good many other spheres. 


There were many signs of decay which ought to have been given serious 
thought. As far as economics were concerned, it may be said that the amazing 
increase of population in Germany before the war brought the question of 
providing daily bread into a more and more prominent position in all spheres 
of political and economic thought and action. 


Unfortunately, those responsible could not make up their minds to arrive 
at the only correct solution and preferred to reach their objective by cheaper 
methods. 


Repudiation of the idea of acquiring fresh territory and the substitution 
for it of the mad desire for the commercial conquest of the world was bound to 
lead eventually to unlimited and injurious industrialisation. 


The first and most fatal result brought about in this way was the 
weakening of the agricultural classes, whose decline was proportionate to the 
increase in the proletariat of the urban areas, until finally the equilibrium was 
completely upset. 


The big barrier dividing rich and poor now became apparent. Luxury and 
poverty lived so close to each other that the consequences were bound to be 
deplorable. Want and frequent unemployment began to play havoc with the 
people and left discontent and embitterment behind them. The result of this was 
to divide the population into political classes. 


Discontent increased in spite of commercial prosperity. Matters finally 
reached that stage which brought about the general conviction that ‘things 
cannot go on as they are,’ although no one seemed able to visualise what was 


261 


really going to happen. 


These were typical and visible signs of the depths which the prevailing 
discontent had reached. Far worse than these, however, were other 
consequences which became apparent as a result of the industrialisation of the 
nation. 


In proportion to the extent that commerce assumed definite control of the 
State, money became more and more of a god whom all had to serve and 
before whom all had to bow. 


Heavenly deities became more and more old-fashioned and were laid 
away in the corners to make room for the worship of Mammon. 


Thus began a period of utter degeneration which became especially 
pernicious because it set in at a time when the nation was more than ever in 
need of an exalted ideal, for a critical hour was threatening. 


Germany should have been prepared to protect with the sword her 
efforts to win her own daily bread ina peaceful way. 


Unfortunately, the predominance of money received support and sanction 
in the very quarter which ought to have been opposed to it. 


His Majesty, the Kaiser, made a mistake when he raised representatives 
of the new financial world to the ranks of the nobility. 


Admittedly, it may be offered as an excuse that even Bismarck failed to 
realise the threatening danger in this respect. In practice, however, all ideal 
virtues became secondary considerations to those of money, for it was clear 
that having once taken this road, the real old aristocracy would very soon rank 
second to the ennobled financiers. 


Financial operations succeed more easily than war operations. Hence it 
was no longer any great attraction for a true hero or even a statesman to be 
brought into touch with some Jewish banker. 


Real merit was not interested in receiving cheap decorations and 
therefore declined them with thanks. But from the standpoint of good breeding 
such a development was deeply regrettable. 


The aristocracy began to lose more and more those racial qualities that 
were a condition of its very existence, with the result that, in many cases, the 


262 


term ‘plebeian’ would have been more appropriate. 


A serious state of economic disruption was being brought about by the 
slow elimination of the personal control of vested interests and the gradual 
transference of the whole economic structure into the hands of joint-stock 
companies. In this way labour became degraded into an object of speculation 
in the hands of unscrupulous exploiters. The de-personalisation of property 
ownership increased on a vast scale. Financial exchange circles began to 
triumph and made slow but sure progress in assuming control of the whole of 
national life. 


Before the war, the internationalisation of the German economic 
structure had already begun by the roundabout way of share issues. It is true 
that a section of the German industrialists made determined attempts to avert 
the danger, but in the end they gave way before the united attacks of money- 
grabbing capitalism, which was assisted in this fight by its faithful henchman, 
the Marxist movement. 


The persistent war against German ‘heavy industries’ was the visible 
start of the internationalisation of German economic life as envisaged by the 
Marxists. 


This, however, could only be brought to a successful conclusion by the 
victory which Marxism was able to gain in the Revolution. 


As I write these words, success is attending the general attack on the 
German State Railways which are now to be turned over to international 
capitalists. Thus ‘International Social Democracy’ has once again attained one 
of its main objectives. 


The best evidence of how far this ‘commercialisation’ of the German 
nation was able to progress, can be seen plainly in the fact that when the war 
was over, one of the leading captains of German industry and commerce gave 
it as his opinion that commerce as such was the only force which could put 
Germany on her feet again. 


This sort of nonsense was uttered just at the time when France was re- 
establishing public education on a humanitarian basis, thus doing away with 
the idea that national life was dependent on commerce rather than on ideal 
values. 


The statement which Stinnes broadcast to the world at that time caused 


263 


incredible, confusion. It was immediately taken up and has become the leading 
motto of all those humbugs and babblers—the ‘statesmen’ whom Fate let loose 
on Germany after the Revolution. 


One of the worst evidences of decadence in Germany before the war 
was the ever-increasing habit of doing things by halves. This was one of the 
consequences of the insecurity that was felt all round, and it is to be attributed 
also to a certain timidity which resulted from one cause or another. The latter 
malady was aggravated by the educational system. 


German education in pre-war times had an extraordinary number of 
weak features. It was simply and exclusively limited to the production of pure 
knowledge and paid little attention to the development of practical ability. 


Still less attention was given to the development of individual character, 
in so far as this is ever possible, and hardly any attention at all was paid to the 
development of a sense of responsibility, to strengthening the will and the 
power of decision. The result of this method was not to turn out stalwart men, 
but rather docile creatures crammed with knowledge and to produce erudite 
people who had a passion for knowing everything. 


Before the war, we Germans were accepted and estimated accordingly. 
The German was liked because good use could be made of him; but there was 
little esteem for him personally, on account of his weakness of character. 


For those who can read its significance aright, there 1s much instruction 
in the fact that among all nationalities Germans were the first to part with their 
national citizenship when they found themselves in a foreign country, and there 
is a world of meaning in the saying that was then prevalent, that in hand one 
can go through the whole country. 


This kind of social etiquette turned out disastrous when it prescribed the 
exclusive forms that had to be observed in the presence of His Majesty. These 
forms insisted that there should be no contract fiction whatsoever, but that 
everything should be praised which His Majesty condescended to like. 


It was just here that the frank expression of manly dignity, and not 
subservience, was most needed because the monarchy as an institution was 
bound to fall as a result of this subservience, for such it was. 


Servility in the presence of monarchs may be good enough for the 
professional lackey and place-hunter, in fact for all those decadent beings who 


264 


feel more at their ease in close proximity to the throne than do honest citizens. 


These exceedingly ‘humble’ creatures, however, though the grovel before 
their lord and bread-giver, invariably put on airs of boundless superciliousness 
towards other mortals, which was particularly impudent when they posed as 
the only people who had the right to be called ‘monarchists.’ 


This was a gross piece of impertinence of which only despicable 
specimens among the newly-ennobled or yet-to-be-ennobled were capable. 


These have always been just the people who have prepared the way for 
the downfall of the monarchy and the monarchical principle. 


It could not be otherwise, for when a man is prepared to stand up for a 
cause, come what may, he never grovels before its representative. 


A man who is serious about the maintenance and welfare of an institution 
will cling to it with might and main and will not be able to .get over it, should 
that institution show certain faults and failings, and he will certainly not run 
around telling the world about it, as certain false democratic ‘friends’ of the 
monarchy have done; but he will approach His Majesty, the wearer of the 
crown himself, to warn him of the seriousness of the situation and persuade the 
monarch to act. 


Furthermore, he will not take up the standpoint that it must be left to His 
Majesty to act as the latter thinks fit, even though the course which he would 
take must plainly lead to disaster. 


The man I am thinking of will deem it his duty to protect the monarchy 
against the monarch himself, no matter what personal risk he may run in so 
doing. If the worth of the monarchical institution were dependent on the, person 
of the monarch himself, then it would be the worst institution imaginable; for 
only in rare cases are kings found to be models of wisdom, understanding and 
integrity of character, though we might like to think otherwise. 


This fact is unpalatable to the professional knaves and lackeys, but all 
upright men, and they are the backbone of the nation, repudiate the nonsensical 
fiction that all monarchs are wise, etc. 


For such men history is history and truth is truth, even where monarchs 
are concerned. It is so seldom that a nation has the good luck to possess a great 
king who is at the same time a great man, that it ought to consider itself 


265 


fortunate if malignant Fate has not reserved for it a still more terrible lot. 


It is clear that the worth and significance of the monarchical principle 
cannot rest in the person of the monarch alone, unless Heaven decrees that the 
crown should be set on the head of a brilliant hero like Frederick the Great, or 
a sagacious man like Wilhelm I. 


This may happen once in several centuries, but hardly oftener than that. 
The ideal of the monarchy takes precedence over the person of the monarch, 
inasmuch as the meaning of the institution must lie in the institution itself. 


Thus, the monarch may be reckoned in the category of those whose duty 
it is to serve. He, too, is but a wheel in the machine and as such he is obliged 
to do his duty towards it. He has to adapt himself for the fulfilment of high aims 
and your true ‘monarchist’ is not he who allows the wearer of the crown to 
commit crimes in its name, but he who prevents this. 


If, therefore, there were no significance attached to the idea itself and 
everything merely centred around the ‘sacred’ person, then it would never be 
possible to depose a ruler who has shown himself to be an imbecile. 


It is essential to resist upon this truth at the present time, because 
recently those phenomena which were in no small measure responsible for the 
collapse of the monarchy have appeared again. 


With a certain amount of naive impudence these persons once again talk 
about ‘their King’—that is to say the man whom they shamefully deserted a 
few years ago, at a most critical, hour. 


Those who refrain from participating in this chorus of lies are summarily 
classified as ‘bad Germans.’ 


They who make the charge are the same class of quitters who, in 1918, 
took to their heels at the very sight of a red armlet, left their Kaiser in the lurch, 
hastily changed their rifles for walking-sticks, took to wearing neutral- 
coloured ties, and disappeared from the limelight camouflaged as peace-loving 
citizens. 


All of a sudden these champions of royalty were nowhere to be found at 
that time. Circumspectly, one by one, these ‘servants and counsellors’ of the 
Crown reappeared to resume their lip-service to royalty, but only after others 
had borne the brunt of the anti-royalist attack and suppressed the Revolution 


266 


for them. 


Once again they are all there, wistfully eyeing the flesh-pots of Egypt and 
almost bursting with devotion for the royal cause. 


This will go on until the day comes when red badges are again in the 
ascendant. Then this whole ramshackle troupe of hangers-on of the old 
monarchy will scuttle off anew like mice from the cats. 


If monarchs were not themselves responsible for such things, one could 
not help sympathising with them, but they must realise: that with such 
champions, thrones may be lost, but never gained. 


All this devotion was a mistake and was the result of our whole system 
of education, which in this case brought about a particularly severe retribution. 


Such lamentable trumpery was kept up at the various courts, that the 
monarchy was slowly becoming undermined. When the whole structure finally 
did begin to totter, they vanished from mortal ken. 


Naturally, grovellers and lick-spittles are never willing to die for their 
masters. That monarchs never realise this, and seldom really take the trouble to 
learn it, has always been their undoing. 


One visible result of a wrong educational system was the fear of 
shouldering responsibility and the resultant weakness in dealing with obvious, 
vital problems of existence. 


The starting-point of this epidemic was, however, in our parliamentary 
institution where the shirking of responsibility was particularly fostered. 
Unfortunately, the disease slowly spread to all branches of everyday life and 
particularly affected the sphere of public affairs. 


Responsibility was being shirked everywhere and this led to insufficient 
or half-hearted measures being taken, personal responsibility for each action 
being reduced to a minimum. 


If we consider the attitude of various governments towards a whole 
series of really pernicious phenomena in public life, we shall at once 
recognise the fearful significance of this policy of half-measures and the lack 
of courage to assume responsibility. 


I shall single out only a few from the large number of instances known to 


267 


me. 


In journalistic circles it is a pleasing custom to speak of the press as a 
‘Great Power’ within the State. As a matter of fact its importance is immense. 
One cannot easily over-estimate it, for the press continues the work of 
education even in adult life. 


Generally speaking, readers of the press can be classified in three 
groups: First, those who believe everything they read; second, those who no 
longer believe anything; third, those who critically examine what they read and 
form their judgments accordingly. 


Numerically, the first group is by far the largest, being composed of the 
broad masses of the people. Intellectually, it forms the simplest portion of the 
nation. 


It cannot be classified according to occupation, but only into grades of 
intelligence. Under this category come all those who have not been born to 
think for themselves or who have not learnt to do so and who, partly through 
incompetence end partly through ignorance, believe everything that is set 
before them in print. 


To these we must add that type of lazy individual who, although capable 
of thinking for himself, out of sheer laziness gratefully absorbs everything that 
otters have thought out, modestly believing this to have been thoroughly done. 


The influence which the press has on all these people who constitute the 
broad masses of a nation, is therefore enormous. 


But somehow they are not in a position, or are not willing, personally to 
sift what is being served up to them, so that their whole attitude towards daily 
problems is almost solely the result of extraneous influence. 


All this can be advantageous where public enlightenment is of a serious 
and truthful character, but great harm is done when scoundrels and liars take a 
hand at this work. 


The second group is numerically smaller, being partly composed of those 
who were formerly in the first group and after a series of bitter 
disappointments are now prepared to believe nothing of what they see in print. 


They hate all newspapers. Either they do not read them at all or they 


268 


become exceptionally annoyed at their contents, which they hold to be nothing 
but a conglomery of lies and mis-statements. 


These people are difficult to handle, for they will always be sceptical of 
the truth. Consequently, they are useless for any form of positive work. 


The third group is easily the smallest, being composed of real 
intellectuals whom natural aptitude and education have taught to think for 
themselves and who in all things try to form their own judgments, while at the 
same time carefully sifting what they read. 


They will not read any newspaper without using their own intelligence to 
collaborate with that of the writer, and naturally this does not set writers an 
easy task. Journalists appreciate this type of reader only with a certain amount 
of reservation. 


Hence the trash that newspapers are capable of serving up 1s of little 
danger—nmuch less of importance to the members of this third group of readers. 


In the majority of cases these readers have learnt to regard every 
journalist as fundamentally a rogue who sometimes speaks the truth. 


Most unfortunately, the value of these readers lies in their intelligence, 
and not in their numerical strength an unhappy state of affairs in a period where 
wisdom counts for nothing and majorities for everything. 


Nowadays, when the voting papers of the masses are the deciding factor, 
the decision lies in the hands of the numerically strongest group; that is to say 
the first group, the crowd of simpletons and the credulous. 


It is an all-important interest of the State and a national duty to prevent 
these people from falling into the hands of false, ignorant or even evil-minded 
teachers. Therefore it is the duty of the State to supervise their education and 
prevent every form of offence in this respect. 


Particular attention should be paid to the press; for its influence on these 
people is by far the strongest and most penetrating of all, since its effect is not 
transitory but continual. Its immense significance lies in the uniform and 
persistent repetition of its teaching. 


Here, if anywhere, the State should never forget that all means should 
converge towards the same end. It must not be led astray by the will-o’-the- 


269 


wisp of so-called ‘freedom of the press,’ or be talked into neglecting its duty, 
and withholding from the nation that which is good and which does good. 


With ruthless determination the State must keep control of this instrument 
of popular education and place it at the service of the State and the nation. 


But what sort of pabulum was it that the German press served up for the 
consumption of its readers in pre-war days? Was it not the most virulent poison 
imaginable? Was not pacifism in its worst form inoculated into our people at a 
time when others were preparing slowly but surely to pounce upon Germany? 


Did not this self-same press of ours instil into the public mind even in 
peacetime a doubt as to the sovereign rights of the State itself, thereby already 
handicapping the State in choosing its means of defence? 


Was it not the German press that understood how to make all the 
nonsensical talk about ‘Western Democracy’ palatable to our people, until an 
exuberant public was eventually prepared to entrust its future to the League of 
Nations? 


Was not this press instrumental in bringing about a state of moral 
degradation among our people? Were not morals and public decency made to 
look ridiculous and classed as out-of-date and banal, until finally our people 
also became ‘modern’? 


By means of persistent attacks, did not the press keep on undermining the 
authority of the State, until one blow sufficed to bring this institution tottering 
to the ground? 


Did not the press oppose with all its might every move to give the State 
that which belongs to the State, and be means of constant criticism injure the 
reputation of the Army, sabotage general conscription and demand refusal of 
military credits, etc.—until the success of this campaign was assured? The 
function of the so-called liberal press was to dig the grave for the German 
people and Reich. No mention need be made of the lying Marxist press. 


To it the spreading of falsehood is as much a vital necessity as hunting 1s 
to a cat. Its sole task is to break the national backbone of the people, thus 
preparing the nation to become the slaves of international finance and its 
masters, the Jews. 


What measures did the State take to counteract this wholesale poisoning 


270 


of the public mind? Absolutely none. The passing of a few paltry decrees, 
punishment meted out in a few cases of flagrant infamy, and there the matter 
ended. 


By this policy it was hoped to win the favour of this pest by means of 
flattery, by a recognition of the ‘value’ of the press, is ‘importance,’ its 
‘educative mission’ and similar nonsense. The Jews acknowledged all this 
with a knowing smile and returned thanks. 


The reason for this ignominious failure on the part of the State lay not so 
much in its refusal to realise the danger as in the out-and-out cowardly way of 
meeting the situation by the adoption of faulty and ineffective measures. No one 
had the courage to employ any energetic and radical methods. 


Everyone temporised in some way or other and instead of striking at its 
heart, only irritated the viper the more. The result was that not only did 
everything remain as it was, but the power of this institution, which should 
have been combated, grew greater from year to year. 


The defence put up by the government in those days against a mainly 
Jew-controlled press that was slowly corrupting the nation, followed no 
definite line of action, it had no determination ‘behind it and above all, no 
fixed objective’ whatsoever in view. 


This is where official understanding of the situation completely failed, 
not only in estimating the importance of the struggle, but in choosing the means 
and deciding on a definite plan. 


They merely tinkered with the problem. Occasionally when bitten, they 
imprisoned one or another journalistic viper for a few weeks or months, but 
the whole poisonous brood was allowed to carry on in peace. 


It must be admitted that all this was partly the result of extraordinarily 
crafty tactics on the part of Jewry on the one hand, and obvious, official 
stupidity or naivety, on the other. 


The Jews were too clever to allow a simultaneous attack to be made on 
the whole of their press. One section functioned as cover for the other. While 
the Marxist newspaper, in the most despicable manner possible, reviled 
everything that was sacred, furiously attacked the State and government and 
incited certain classes of the community against each other, bourgeois- 
democratic papers, also in Jewish hands, succeeded in camouflaging 


271 


themselves as model examples of objectivity. They studiously avoided harsh 
language, knowing well that blockheads are capable of judging only by 
external appearances and are never able to penetrate to the real depth and 
meaning of anything. They measure the worth of an object by its exterior and 
not by its contents. This form of human frailty was carefully studied and 
understood by the press. 


By this class of blockheads, the Frankfurter Zeitung would be 
acknowledged as the essence of respectability. It always carefully avoided 
calling a spade a spade. 


It deprecated the use of every form of physical force and persistently 
appealed to the nobility of fighting with ‘intellectual’ weapons. 


This method of fighting was, curiously enough, most popular with the 
least intellectual classes. That is one of the results of our defective education, 
which deprives young people of their natural instincts, pumps into them a 
certain amount of knowledge without, however, being able to give them real 
insight, since this requires not only diligence and goodwill, but innate 
understanding. 


This final insight at which man must aim is the understanding of causes 
which an instinctive and fundamental. 


Let me explain: Man must not fall into the error of thinking that he was 
ever meant to become lord and master of Nature. 


A lopsided education has helped to encourage that illusion. Man must 
realise that a fundamental law of necessity reigns throughout the whole realm 
of Nature and that his existence is subject to the law of eternal struggle and 
strife. 


He will then feel that there cannot be a separate law for mankind ina 
universe in which planets and suns follow their orbits, where moons and 
planets trace their destined paths, where the strong are always the masters of 
the weak and where the latter must obey or be destroyed. 


Man must also submit to the eternal principles of this supreme wisdom. 
He may try to understand them but he can never free himself from their sway. 


It is just for our intellectual demi-monde that the Jew writes those papers 
which he calls his ‘intellectual’ press. For them the Frankfurter Zeitung and 


212 


Berliner Tageblatt are written, the tone being adapted to them, and it is over 
these people that such papers have an influence. 


While studiously avoiding all forms of expression that might strike the 
reader as crude, the poison is injected from other vials into the hearts of the 
clientele. 


The effervescent tone and the fine phraseology lull the reader into 
believing that a love for knowledge and more it principle is the sole driving 
force that determines the policy of such papers, whereas in reality these 
features represent a sunning way of disarming any opposition that might be 
directed against the press. 


Some make a parade of respectability and the imbecile public is all the 
more ready to believe them since the others indulge only in moderate ravings 
which never amount to abuse of the ‘freedom of the press’ (as this system of 
feeding the public on lies and poisoning the public mind 1s called). 


Hence, the authorities are very slow indeed to take any steps against 
these journalistic bandits for fear of immediately alienating the sympathy of the 
so-called respectable press fear that is only too well founded, for the moment 
any attempt is made to proceed against any member of the gutter press all the 
others rush to its assistance at once, not indeed to support its policy, but simply 
and solely to defend the principles of freedom of the press and liberty of 
public opinion. 


This outcry will succeed in intimidating the most stalwart, for 1t comes 
from the mouth of what is called decent journalism. 


In this way the, poison was allowed to enter the national bloodstream 
and infect public life, without the government taking any effectual measures to 
master the course of the disease. 


The ridiculous half-measures that were taken were in themselves an 
indication of the process of disintegration that was already threatening to break 
up the Reich, for an institution practically surrenders its existence when it is no 
Longer determined to defend itself with all the weapons at its command. 


Every half-measure is the outward expression of an internal process of 
decay which must lead to an external collapse sooner or later. 


I believe that our present generation would easily master this danger, if it 


273 


were led aright, for it has gone through certain experiences which must have 
strengthened the nerves of all those who were not broken by them. 


Certainly in days to come the Jews will raise a tremendous cry in their 
newspapers once a hand is laid on their favourite nest, once a move is made to 
put an end to this scandalous press and once this instrument which moulds 
public opinion is brought under State control and no longer left in the hands of 
aliens and enemies of the people. 


I am certain that this will be easier for us than it was for our fathers. The 
scream of the twelve-inch shell is more penetrating than the hiss of a thousand 
Jewish newspaper vipers. Therefore, let them go on with their hissing. 


A further example of the weak and hesitating way in which vital national 
problems were dealt with in pre-war Germany is the following. Hand-in-hand 
with the political and moral process of infecting the nation, an equally virulent 
process of infection had for many years been attacking the health of the nation. 


In large cities particularly, syphilis steadily increased and tuberculosis 
kept pace with it in reaping its harvest of death in almost every part of the 
country. 


Although in both cases the effect on the nation was alarming, it seemed 
as if nobody were ina position to undertake any decisive measures against 
these scourges. 


In the case of syphilis especially, the attitude of the State and the public 
authorities was one of absolute capitulation. To combat this state of affairs 
measures more sweeping than those actually adopted should have been 
enforced. 


The discovery of a remedy which was of a questionable nature and the 
excellent way in which it was placed on the market were of little assistance ill 
fighting such a scourge. Here again the only course to adopt 1s to attack the 
causes rather than the symptoms of the disease, but in this case, the primary 
cause 1s to be found in the manner in which love has been prostituted. 


Even though this did not directly bring about the fearful disease itself, the 
nation must still suffer serious damage thereby, for the moral havoc resulting 
from this prostitution would be sufficient to bring about the destruction of, the 
nation, slowly but surely. 


274 


This Judaising of our spiritual life and mammonising of our natural 
instinct for procreation will sooner or later work havoc with our whole 
posterity. 


Instead of strong, healthy children, the product of natural feelings, we 
shall see miserable specimens of humanity resulting from economic 
calculation, for economic considerations are becoming more and more the 
foundation and the sole preliminary condition of marriage while love looks for 
an outlet elsewhere. 


Here as elsewhere, one may defy Nature for a certain period of time, but 
sooner or later she will take her inevitable revenge, and when man realises 
this truth, it is often too late. 


Our own nobility furnishes an example of the devastating consequences 
that result from a persistent refusal to recognise the primary conditions 
necessary for normal wedlock. 


Here we are face to face with the results of procreation which is, on the 
one hand, determined by social pressure and, on the other, by financial 
considerations. 


The one leads to inherited debility, and the other to adulteration of the 
blood-strain; for all the Jewish daughters of the department store proprietors 
are looked upon as eligible mates to co-operate in propagating his lordship’s 
stock, and the stock certainly looks it. All this leads to absolute degeneration. 


Nowadays our bourgeoisie is making efforts to follow in the same path. 
Theirs will be a similar fate. 


These unpleasant truths are hastily and nonchalantly brushed aside, as if 
by so doing the real state of affairs could also be abolished, but it cannot be 
denied that the population of our great towns and cities is tending more and 
more to avail itself of prostitution in the exercise of its amorous instincts and is 
thus becoming more and more contaminated by the scourge of venereal 
disease. 


On the one hand, the visible effects of this mass-infection can be 
observed in our lunatic asylums and, on the other hand, alas! among the 
children. These are the doleful and tragic products of the steadily increasing 
scourge that is poisoning our sexual life. Their sufferings are the visible results 
of parental vice. 


215 


There are many ways of becoming resigned to this unpleasant and 
terrible fact. Many people go about seeing nothing or, to be more correct, not 
wanting to see anything. This is by far the simplest and cheapest attitude to 
adopt. 


Others cover themselves in the sacred mantle of prudery, as ridiculous as 
itis false. They describe the whole condition of affairs as sinful and are 
profoundly indignant when brought face to face with a victim. 


They close their eyes to this godless scourge in pious horror and pray to 
the Almighty that He—if possible after their own death—may rain down fire 
and brimstone as on Sodom and Gomorrah and so once again make a lasting 
example of this shameless section of humanity. 


Finally, there are those who are well aware of the terrible results which 
this scourge will inevitably bring about, but they merely shrug their shoulders, 
fully convinced of their inability to undertake anything against this peril. 
Hence, matters are allowed to take their course. 


Undoubtedly all this is very convenient and simple, only the fact must not 
be overlooked that this convenient way of approaching things can leave fatal 
consequences for our national life. 


The excuse that other nations are not faring any better does not alter the 
fact of our own deterioration, except that the feeling of sympathy for other 
stricken nations makes our own suffering easier to bear. 


But the important question that arises here is, Which nations will be the 
first to take the initiative in mastering this scourge, and which nations will 
succumb to it? This will be the final upshot of the whole situation. This will be 
an acid test of racial value. 


The race that fails to come through the test will simply die out and its 
place will be taken by the healthier ant stronger races, which will be able to 
endure greater hardships. 


As this problem primarily concerns posterity, it belongs to that category 
of which it is said with terrible justification that the sins of the fathers are 
visited on their offspring unto the tenth generation. This is a consequence 
which follows on an infringement of the laws of blood and race. The sin 
against blood and race is the hereditary sin in this world and it brings disaster 
on every nation that commits it. 


276 


The attitude towards this one vital problem in pre-war Germany was 
most regrettable. What measures were adopted to arrest the infection of our 
youth in the large cities? 


What was done to put an end to the contamination and mammonisation of 
sexual life among us? What was done to fight the resultant spreading of 
syphilis throughout the whole of our people? 


The reply to this question can best be illustrated by showing what should 
have been done. 


Instead of tackling this problem in a haphazard way, the authorities 
should leave realised that the happiness or unhappiness of future generations 
depended on its solution and indeed that the nation’s entire future may, perhaps 
needs must, depend thereon. 


To have admitted this would have demanded that active measures be 
carried out ina ruthless manner. The primary condition would have been that 
the enlightened attention of the whole country should be concentrated on this 
terrible danger, so that every individual would realise the importance of 
fighting against it. 


It would be futile to impose obligations of a definite character which are 
often difficult to bear and expect them to become generally effective, unless the 
public were thoroughly instructed in the necessity of imposing and accepting 
such obligations. 


This demands a widespread and systematic method of enlightenment, and 
all other daily problems that might distract public attention from this great 
central problem should be relegated to the background. 


In every case where there are exigencies or tasks that seem impossible to 
deal with successfully, public opinion must be concentrated on the one 
problem, under the conviction that the solution of this problem alone is a 
matter of life or death. 


Only in this way can public interest be aroused to such a pitch as will 
urge people to combine in a great voluntary effort and achieve important 
results. 


This fundamental truth applies also to the individual, provided he is 
desirous of attaining some great end. He must always concentrate his efforts on 


214 


one definitely limited stage of his progress which has to be completed before 
the next step be attempted. 


Those who do not endeavour to realise their aims step by step, and who 
do not concentrate their energy on reaching the individual stages, will never 
attain the final objective. 


At some stage or other they will falter and fail. This systematic way of 
approaching an objective is an art in itself and always calls for the expenditure 
of every ounce of energy in order to conquer step after step of the road. 


Therefore, the most essential preliminary condition necessary for an 
attack on such a difficult stage of the human road 1s that the authorities should 
succeed in convincing the masses that the immediate objective which is now 
being fought for is the only one that deserves to be considered and the only one 
on which everything depends. 


The broad masses are never able to see clearly the whole stretch of the 
road lying in front of them, without becoming tired and thus losing faith in their 
ability to complete the task. 


To a certain extent they will keep the objective in mind, but they are only 
able to survey the whole road in small stages, as in the case of the traveller 
who knows where his journey is going to end, but who masters the endless 
stretch far better by attacking it in stages. Only in this way can he keep up his 
determination and reach the final objective. 


It is in this way, with the assistance of every form of propaganda, that the 
problem of fighting venereal disease should be placed before the public—not 
as a task for the nation but as the main task. 


Every possible means should be employed to bring the truth about this 
scourge home to the minds of the people, until the whole nation has been 
convinced that everything depends on the solution of this problem: that is to 
say, a healthy future or national decay. 


Only after such preparatory measures have been taken—if necessary, 
spread over a period of many years—will public attention and public 
resolution be fully aroused, and only then can serious and definite measures be 
undertaken without the risk of these not being fully understood or of the 
authorities being suddenly faced with a slackening of the public will. 


278 


It must be made clear to all that a serious fight against this scourge calls 
for vast sacrifices and an enormous amount of work. 


To wage war against syphilis means fighting against prostitution, against 
prejudice, against old-established customs, against current fashion, public 
opinion, and, last but not least, again false prudery in certain circles. 


The first preliminary condition to be fulfilled, before the State can claim 
a moral right to fight against all these things, is that the young generation should 
be afforded facilities for contracting early marriages. 


Late marriages have the sanction of a custom which, from whatever 
angle we view it, is, and will remain, a disgrace to humanity, an institution 
which ill befits a creature who is wont to regard himself as having been 
fashioned in God’s image. 


Prostitution is a disgrace to humanity and cannot be removed simply by 
academic or charitable methods. Its restriction and final extermination 
presupposes the removal of a whole series of contributory circumstances. 


The first remedy must always be to establish such conditions as will 
make early marriages possible, especially for young men—for women are, 
after all, only the passive factor. An illustration of the extent to which people 
nowadays are labouring under a delusion, is afforded by the fact that not 
infrequently one hears mothers in so-called ‘better’ circles openly expressing 
their satisfaction at having found as a husband for their daughter, a man who 
has already sown his wild oats, etc. 


As there is usually so little shortage of men of this type, the poor girl 
finds no difficulty in getting a mate of this description, and the children of this 
marriage are a visible result of such supposedly sensible unions. 


When one realises, apart from this, that every possible effort 1s being 
made to hinder the process of procreation and that Nature is being wilfully 
cheated of her rights, there remains really only one question: Why is such an 
institution as marriage still in existence, and what are its functions? 


Is it really nothing better than prostitution? Does our duty to posterity no 
longer play any part? Or do people not realise the nature of the curse they are 
inflicting on themselves and their offspring by such criminally foolish neglect 
of one of the primary laws of Nature? 


279 


This is how civilised nations degenerate and gradually perish. 


Marriage is not an end in itself but must serve the greater end, which is 
that of increasing and maintaining the human species and the race. This is its 
only meaning and purpose. 


This being admitted, then it 1s clear that the institution of marriage must 
be judged by the manner in which its allotted function is fulfilled. 


Therefore, early marriages should be the rule, because thus the young 
couple will still have that pristine force which is the fountainhead of a healthy 
posterity with unimpaired powers of resistance. 


Of course early marriages cannot be made the rule unless a whole series 
of social measures are first introduced without which early marriage cannot 
even be thought of. 


In other words, a solution of this question, which seems a small problem 
in itself, cannot be brought about without adopting radical measures to alter the 
social background. 


The importance of such measures ought to be studied and properly 
estimated, especially at a time when the so-called ‘social’ Republic has shown 
itself unable to solve the housing problem and has thus made it impossible for 
innumerable couples to get married. That sort of policy prepares the way for 
the further advance of prostitution. 


Another reason why early marriages are impossible is our nonsensical 
method of regulating the scale of salaries, which pays far too little attention to 
the problem of family support. 


Prostitution, therefore, can only be really seriously tackled if, by means 
of a radical social reform, early marriage is made easier than hitherto. This is 
the first preliminary necessity for the solution of this problem. 


Secondly, a whole series of false notions must be eradicated from our 
system of bringing up and educating children, a thing which hitherto no one 
seems to have worried about. 


In our present educational system a balance will have to be established, 
first and foremost, between mental instruction and physical training. 


What is known as the Gymnasium to-day is a positive insult to the Greek 


280 


institution. Our system of education entirely loses sight of the fact that, in the 
long run, a healthy mind can exist only ina healthy body. This statement 
applies with few exceptions, particularly to the broad masses of the nation. 


In the pre-war Germany there was a time when no one, took the trouble 
to think over this truth. Training of the body was criminally neglected, the one- 
sided training of the mind being regarded as a sufficient guarantee for the 
nation’s greatness. 


This mistake was destined to show its effects sooner than had been 
anticipated. It is not pure chance that the Bolshevist teaching flourishes in those 
regions whose degenerate population has been brought to the verge of 
starvation, as, for example, in the case of Central Germany, Saxony, and the 
Ruhr. 


In all these districts there is a marked absence of any serious resistance, 
even by the so-called intellectual classes, against this Jewish contagion, and 
the simple reason is that the intellectual classes are themselves physically 
degenerate, not through privation, but through education. 


The exclusive intellectualism of the education in vogue among our upper 
classes makes them unfit for life’s struggle in an epoch in which physical force, 
and not intellect, is the dominating factor. 


Thus, they are neither capable of maintaining themselves, nor of making 
their way in life. In nearly every case physical disability is the forerunner of 
personal cowardice. 


The extravagant emphasis laid on purely intellectual education and the 
consequent neglect of physical training must necessarily lead to sexual thoughts 
in early youth. 


Those boys whose constitutions have been trained and hardened by 
sports and gymnastics are less prone to sexual indulgence than those stay-at- 
homes who have been fed exclusively with mental pabulum. 


Sound methods of education cannot, however, afford to disregard this 
and we must not forget that what a healthy young man demands from a woman 
will differ from the demands of a weakling who has been prematurely 
corrupted. 


Thus in every branch of our education the day’s curriculum must be 


281 


arranged so as to occupy a boy’s free time in profitable development of his 
physical powers. He has no right in those years to loaf about, becoming a 
nuisance in public streets and in cinemas; but when his day’s work, is done he 
ought to harden his young body so that his strength may not be found wanting 
when the occasion arises. 


To prepare for this and to carry it out should be the function of our 
educational system and not exclusively to cram him with knowledge. 


Our school system must also rid itself of the notion that the training of the 
body is a task that should be left to the individual himself. There is no such 
thing as freedom to sin against posterity and thus against the race. 


The fight against pollution of the mind must be waged simultaneously 
with the training of the body. To-day the whole of our public life may be 
compared to a hot-house for the forced growth of sexual notions and 
excitements. 


A glance at the till-of-fare provided by our cinemas, playhouses and 
theatres, suffices to prove that this 1s not the right food, especially for our 
young people. Hoardings and advertisement kiosks combine to attract the 
public in the most vulgar manner. 


Anyone who has not altogether lost contact with adolescent yearnings 
will realise that all this must have very grave consequences. This seductive 
and sensuous atmosphere puts into the heads of our youth notions of which, at 
their age, they ought still to be ignorant. 


Unfortunately, the results of this kind of education can best be seen in our 
contemporary youth who are prematurely grown up and, therefore, old before 
their time. 


The courts of law throw from, time to time a distressing light on the 
spiritual life of our fourteen and fifteen-year-old-children. 


Who, therefore, will be surprised to learn that venereal disease claims 
as victims at this age? And is it not a frightful scandal to see the number of 
young men physically weak and intellectually ruined, who have been 
introduced to the mysteries of marriage by the whores of the big cities? 


Those who want seriously to combat prostitution must first of all assist 
in removing the spiritual conditions on which it thrives. They will have to 


282 


clean up the moral pollution of our city ‘culture’ fearlessly and without regard 
for the outcry that will follow. 


If we do not drag our youth out of the morass of their present 
environment they will be engulfed by it. Those people who do not want to see 
these things are deliberately encouraging them and are guilty of spreading the 
effects of prostitution to the future, for the future belongs to our younger 
generation. 


This process of cleansing our Kultur will have to be applied in 
practically all spheres. The stage, art, literature, the cinema, the press and 
advertisement posters, all must have the stains of pollution removed and be 
used in the service of a national and cultural ideal. 


The life of the people must be freed from the asphyxiating perfume of our 
modern eroticism and also from every unmanly and prudish form of insincerity. 
In all these things, the aim and the method must be determined by thoughtful 
consideration for the preservation of our national well-being in body and soul. 


The right to personal freedom comes second in importance to the duty of 
preserving the race. 


Only after such measures have been put into practice can a medical 
campaign against this scourge begin with some hope of success. But here again 
half-measures will be valueless. 


Far-reaching and important decisions will have to be made. It would be 
doing things by halves if incurables were given the opportunity of infecting one 
healthy person after another. 


This would be practising that kind of humanitarianism which allows 
hundreds to perish in order to prevent the suffering of one individual. 


The demand that it should be made impossible for defective people to 
continue to propagate defective offspring is a demand that is based on most 
reasonable grounds, and its proper fulfilment is the most humane task that 
mankind has to face. 


Unhappy and undeserved suffering will be prevented in millions of 
cases, with the result that there will be a gradual improvement in national 
health. 


283 


A determined decision to act in this manner will at the same time 
provide an obstacle against the further spread of venereal disease. 


It would then be a case, where necessary, of mercilessly isolating all 
incurables—perhaps a barbaric measure for those unfortunates—but a blessing 
for the present generation and for posterity. 


The temporary pain thus experienced in this century can, and will, save 
thousands of future generations from suffering. 


The fight against syphilis and its pace-maker, prostitution, 1s one of the 
gigantic tasks of mankind; gigantic, because it is not merely a case of solving a 
single problem, but of the removal of a whole series of evils which are the 
contributory causes of this scourge. 


Disease of the body in this case is merely the result of a diseased 
condition of the moral, social, and racial instincts. 


If, for reasons of indolence or cowardice, this fight is not fought to a 
finish, we may imagine what conditions will be like five centuries hence. Little 
of God’s image will be left in human nature, except to mock the Creator. 


What has been done in Germany to counteract this scourge? If we think 
calmly over the answer we shall find it distressing. 


It is true that in governmental circles the terrible and injurious effects of 
this disease were well known, but the counter-measures which were officially 
adopted were ineffective and a hopeless failure. 


They tinkered with cures for the symptoms wholly regardless of the 
cause of the disease. Prostitutes were medically examined and controlled as 
far as possible, and when signs of infection were apparent they were sent to 
hospital. 


When outwardly cured, they were once more let loose on humanity. It is 
true that ‘protective legislation’ was introduced which made sexual intercourse 
a punishable offence for all those not completely cured, or for those suffering 
from venereal disease. 


This legislation was correct in theory, but in practice, it failed 
completely. In the First place, in the majority of cases women will decline to 
appear in court as witnesses against men who have robbed them of their health. 


284 


Women would be exposed far more than men to uncharitable remarks in 
such cases, and one can imagine what their position would be if they had been 
infected by their own husbands. 


Should women in that case bring a charge? Or what should they do? In 
the case of the man there is the additional fact that he is frequently unfortunate 
enough to run up against this danger when he is under the influence of alcohol. 


His condition makes it impossible for him to assess the qualities of his 
‘amorous beauty,’ a fact which is well known to every diseased prostitute and 
makes her single out men in this ‘ideal’ condition for preference. 


The result is that the unfortunate man is not able to recollect later on who 
his compassionate benefactress was, which is not surprising in cities like 
Berlin and Munich. 


Many such cases are visitors from the provinces who, held helpless and 
enthralled by the magic charm of city life, become an easy prey for prostitutes. 


Finally, who is able to say whether he has been ‘infected or not? Are 
there not innumerable cases on record where an apparently cured person has a 
relapse and does untold harm without knowing it? 


Therefore, in practice, the results of these legislative measures are 
negative. The same applies to the control of prostitution, and, finally, even 
medical treatment and cure are today still unsafe and doubtful. 


One thing only is certain, the scourge has spread further and further in 
spite of all precautionary measures, and this alone suffices definitely to prove 
and substantiate their inefficacy. 


Everything else that was undertaken was just as ineffectual as it was 
absurd. The spiritual prostitution of the people was neither arrested nor was 
anything whatsoever undertaken in this direction. 


Those, however, who do not regard this subject as a serious one would 
do well to examine the statistical data of the spread of this disease, study its 
growth in the last century and contemplate the possibilities of its further 
development. The ordinary observer, unless he were particularly stupid, would 
experience a cold shudder if the a certain historical value, rather than the 
products of not merely artistic but even mental degeneration bordering on the 
futile. 


285 


Here, in the cultural sphere, the signs of the coming political collapse 
first became manifest. 


The Bolshevisation of art is the only cultural form of life and the only 
spiritual manifestation of which Bolshevism is capable. 


Anyone to whom this statement may appear strange need only take a 
glance at those lucky States which have become Bolshevised and, to his horror, 
he will there recognise those morbid monstrosities which have been produced 
by insane and degenerate people. 


All those artistic aberrations which, since the beginning of the present 
century, have been classified under the names Cubism and Dadaism, are 
manifestations of art which have come to be officially recognised by the State 
itself. 


This phenomenon made its appearance even during the short-lived 
period of the Soviet Republic in Bavaria. At that time one might easily have 
recognised how all the official posters, propaganda pictures and newspapers, 
etc., showed signs not only of political, but also of cultural decadence. 


About sixty years ago a political collapse such as we are experiencing 
to-day would have been just as inconceivable as the cultural decline which has 
been manifested in Cubist and Futurist pictures ever since 1900. 


Sixty years ago an exhibition of so-called Dadaist ‘experiences’ would 
have been an absolutely preposterous idea. The organisers of such an 
exhibition would then have been certified fit for the lunatic asylum, whereas 
to-day they are appointed presidents of art societies. 


At that time such an epidemic would never have been allowed to spread. 
Public opinion would not have tolerated it, and the government would not have 
remained silent, for it is the duty of a government to save the people from being 
driven into such intellectual madness. 


Intellectual madness would have resulted from a development that 
followed the acceptance of this kind of art. It would have marked one of the 
worst changes in human history, for it would have meant that a retrogressive 
process had begun to take place in the human brain, the final stages of which 
would have been unthinkable. 


If we study the course of our cultural life during the last twenty-five 


286 


years we shall be astonished to note how far we have already gone in this 
process of retrogression. 


Everywhere we find the presence of those germs which give rise to 
protuberant growths that must sooner or later bring about the ruin of our 
culture. Here we find undoubted symptoms of slow corruption, and woe to the 
nations that are no longer able to bring that morbid process to a halt! In almost 
all the various fields of German art and culture these morbid phenomena may 
be observed. Here everything seems to have passed the culminating point of its 
excellence and to have entered the curve of a hasty decline. 


At the beginning of the century the theatres seemed already degenerate 
and ceased to be cultural factors, except the Court theatres, which opposed the 
prostitution of the national art. 


Apart from these, and a few other praiseworthy exceptions, the plays 
produced on the stage were of such a nature that people would have benefited 
by not visiting them at all. 


A sad symptom of internal decay was manifested in the fact that it was 
impossible to allow adolescents to frequent most of these so-called ‘centres of 
art,’ a brazen admission that this was so, being the notice exhibited at the 
entrance-doors: Adults only. 


Let it be borne in mind that these precautions had to be taken in regard to 
institutions whose main purpose should have been to promote the education of 
the youth and not merely to provide amusement for sophisticated adults. 


What would the great dramatists of other times have said of such 
measures and, above all, of the conditions which made these measures 
necessary? How exasperated Schiller would have been, and how Goethe 
would have turned away in disgust! 


But what are Schiller, Goethe and Shakespeare when confronted with the 
heroes of our modern German literature? Old, frowsy, out-moded and finished, 
for it was typical of this epoch that not only were its own products bad, but that 
it reviled everything that had been really great in the past. 


This is a phenomenon that is very characteristic of such epochs. The 
more vile and miserable the men and products of an epoch, the more they will 
hate and denigrate the ideal achievements of former generations. 


287 


What these people would like best would be to destroy completely every 
vestige of the past, in order to do away with that sole standard of comparison 
which prevents their own daubs from being looked upon as art. 


Therefore the more lamentable and wretched the products of each new 
era, the more it will try to obliterate all the memorials of the past. Any real 
innovation that is for the benefit of mankind can always face comparison with 
the best of what has gone before, and frequently even serves to reveal the true 
value of the latter. 


There is no fear that modem productions of real value will look pale and 
worthless beside the monuments of the past. What is contributed to the general 
treasury of human culture often fulfils a part that is necessary in order to keep 
the memory of old achievements alive, because this memory alone is the 
standard whereby our own works are properly appreciated. 


Only those who have nothing of value to give to the world, but pretend 
that they have much to bestow, will oppose everything that already exists and 
would have it destroyed at all costs. This holds good not only for new 
phenomena in the cultural domain, but also in politics. The more inferior new 
revolutionary movements are, the more will they try to denigrate the old forms. 


Here again the desire to palm off their shoddy products as great and 
original achievements leads them into a blind hatred against everything which 
belongs to the past and which is superior to their own work. 


As long as the historical memory of Frederick the Great, for instance, 
still lives, Friedrich Ebert can arouse only a problematic admiration. The 
relation of the hero of Sans Souci to the former publican of Bremen may be 
compared to that of the sun to the moon, for the moon can shine only after the 
direct rays of the sun have left the earth. 


Thus we can readily understand why it 1s that all the new moons in 
human history have hated the fixed stars. In the field of politics, if Fate should 
happen temporarily to place the ruling power in the hands of these nonentities, 
they are not only eager to defile and revile the past, but at the same time they 
will use any means to evade criticism of their own acts. 


The Law for the Protection of the Republic, which the new German State 
enacted, may be taken as an example illustrating this truth. 


One has good reason to be suspicious in regard to any new idea, or any 


288 


doctrine or philosophy, any political or economic movement, which tries to 
deny everything that the past has produced or to represent it as inferior and 
worthless. 


Such an antipathy is usually due to a sense of inferiority or to malicious 
intention. Any new movement which is really beneficial to human progress 
will always have to begin its constructive work at the level at which the last 
stones of the structure have been laid. 


It need not blush to utilise those truths which have already been 
established, for all human culture, as well as man himself, is only the result of 
one long line of development, where each generation has contributed its share 
in the building of the whole structure. 


The meaning and purpose of revolutions cannot be to tear down the 
whole building, but to take away what has not been well fitted into it or is 
unsuitable, and to fill in the gap thus caused, after which the main construction 
of the building will be carried on. 


Only thus will it be possible to talk of human progress, for otherwise the 
world would never be free of chaos, since each generation would feel entitled 
to reject the past, and to destroy all the work of the past, as the necessary 
preliminary to any new work of its own. 


The saddest feature of the condition in which our whole civilisation 
found itself before the War was the fact that 1t was not only barren of any 
creative force to produce its own works of art and civilisation but that it hated, 
defiled and tried to efface the memory of the superior works produced in the 
past. About the end of the last century people were less interested in producing 
new significant works of their own—particularly in the fields of dramatic art 
and literature—than in defaming the best works of the past and in presenting 
them as inferior and antiquated. 


As if this period of disgraceful decadence was capable of accomplishing 
anything! The efforts made to conceal the past from the eyes of the present 
afforded clear evidence of the fact that these apostles of the future acted from 
an evil intent. 


These symptoms should have made it clear to all that it was not a 
question of new, though wrong, cultural ideas, but of a process which was 
undermining the very foundations of civilisation. 


289 


It threw the artistic feeling which had hitherto been quite sane into utter 
confusion, thus spiritually preparing the way for political Bolshevism. If the 
creative spirit of the Periclean age be manifested in the Parthenon, then the 
Bolshevist era is manifested by a cubist mask. 


In this connection attention must be drawn once again to the want of 
courage displayed by one section of our people, namely, by those who, in 
virtue of their education and position, ought to have felt themselves obliged to 
take up a firm stand against this outrage against our culture, but they refrained 
from offering serious resistance and surrendered to what they considered the 
inevitable. 


This inaction of theirs was due, however, to sheer funk lest the apostles 
of Bolshevist art might raise a rumpus; for those apostles always violently 
attacked everyone who was not ready to recognise them as the choice spirits of 
artistic creation, and they tried to strangle all opposition by saying that it was 
the product of Philistine and backwater minds. 


People trembled in fear lest they might be accused by these yahoos and 
swindlers of lacking artistic appreciation, as if it would have been a disgrace 
not to be able to understand and appreciate the effusions of those mental 
degenerates or cunning rogues. 


Those cultural disciples, however, had a very simple way of presenting 
their own effusions as works of the highest quality. 


They offered incomprehensible and manifestly crazy productions to their 
amazed contemporaries as what they called ‘an inner experience.’ 


Thus they forestalled all adverse criticism, at very little cost indeed. Of 
course, nobody ever doubted that there could have been inner experiences like 
that; but some doubt ought to have arisen as to whether or not there was any 
justification for exhibiting these hallucinations of psychopaths or criminals to 
the sane portion of human society. 


The works produced by a Moritz von Schwind or a Bocklin were also 
the fruits of an inner experience, but these were the experiences of divinely 
gifted artists and not of buffoons. This situation afforded a good opportunity of 
studying the miserable cowardliness of our so-called intellectuals who shirked 
the duty of offering serious resistance to the poisoning of the sound instincts of 
our people. 


290 


They left it to the people themselves to formulate their own attitude 
towards this impudent nonsense. Lest they might be considered as 
understanding nothing of art, they accepted every caricature of art, until, they 
finally lost the power of judging what was really good or bad. 


Taken all in all, there were superabundant symptoms to show that a 
diseased epoch had begun. 


Still another critical symptom has to be considered. In the course of the 
nineteenth century our towns and cities began more and more to lose their 
character as centres of civilisation and became more and more centres of 
habitation. 


In our great modem cities the proletariat does not show much attachment 
to the place where it lives. This feeling results from the fact that their 
dwelling-place is nothing but an accidental abode, and is also partly due to the 
frequent change of residence which 1s forced upon them by social conditions. 


There is no time for the growth of any attachment to the town in which 
they live. Another reason lies in the cultural barrenness and superficiality of 
our modern cities. At the time of the German Wars of Liberation our German 
towns and cities were not only small in number, but also very modest in size. 


The few that could really be called great cities were mostly the 
residential cities of princes; as such they had almost always a definite cultural 
value and also a definite cultural aspect. 


Those few towns which had more than fifty thousand inhabitants were, in 
comparison with modern cities of the same size, rich in scientific and artist, 
treasures. At the time when Munich had a population of not more than sixty 
thousand souls it was already well on the way to becoming one of the first 
centres of German art. 


Nowadays, almost every industrial town has a population at least as 
large as that, without having anything of real value to call its own. They are 
agglomerations of tenement houses and congested dwelling-houses, and nothing 
else. 


It would be a miracle if anybody should grow sentimentally attached to 
such a meaningless place. Nobody can grow attached to a place which offers 
only just as much, or as little, as any other place would offer, which, has no 
character of its own and where obviously pains have been taken to avoid 


291 


everything that might have any resemblance to an artistic appearance. 


But this is not all. Even the great cities become more barren of real 
works of art the more they increase in population. They assume more and more 
a neutral atmosphere and present the same aspect, though on a larger scale, as 
the wretched little factory towns. 


Everything that our modern age has contributed to the cultural aspect of 
our great cities is absolutely deficient. All our towns are living on the glory 
and the treasures of the past. 


If we take away from the Munich of to-day everything that was created 
under Ludwig I, we should be horror-stricken to see how meagre has been the 
output of important artistic creations since that time. 


One might say much the same of Berlin and most of our other great 
towns. 


The following is the essential thing to be noticed. Our great modern 
cities have no outstanding monuments that dominate the general aspect of the 
city and could be pointed to as the symbols of a whole epoch, yet almost every 
ancient town had a monument erected to its glory. 


It was not in private dwellings that the characteristic art of ancient cities 
was displayed, but in the public monuments which were not meant to have a 
transitory interest but an enduring one. 


This was because they did not represent the wealth of some individual 
citizen but the greatness and importance of the community. 


It was under this inspiration that those monuments arose which bound the 
individual inhabitants to their own town in a manner that is often almost 
incomprehensible to us to-day. 


What struck the eye of the individual citizen was not a number of 
mediocre private buildings, but imposing structures that belonged to the whole 
community. 


In contradistinction to these, private dwellings were of only very 
secondary importance indeed. 


When we compare the size of those ancient public buildings with that of 
the private dwellings belonging to the same epoch, then we can understand the 


292 


great importance which was attached to the principle that those works which 
reflected and affected the life of the community should take precedence of all 
others. 


Among the broken arches and vast spaces that are covered with ruins 
from the ancient world the colossal monuments which still arouse our wonder 
have not been left to us from the commercial palaces of those days but from the 
temples of the gods and the public edifices that belonged to the State. 


The community itself was the owner of those great edifices. Even in the 
pomp of Rome during the decadence it was not the villas and palaces of the 
citizens that occupied the most prominent place, but rather the temples and the 
baths, the stadia, the circuses, the aqueducts, the basilicas, etc., which 
belonged to the State and therefore to the people as a whole. 


In medieval Germany also, the same principle held good, although the 
artistic outlook was quite different. In ancient times the theme that found its 
expression in the Acropolis or the Pantheon was now clothed in the form of the 
Gothic Cathedral. 


In the medieval cities these monumental structures towered gigantically 
above the swarm of smaller buildings, with their framework walls of wood 
and brick, and they remain the dominant feature of these cities even to our own 
day, although they are becoming more and more obscured by the tenement 
houses. 


They determine the character and appearance of the locality. Cathedrals, 
city halls, corn-exchanges, forts, are the outward expression of an idea which 
has its counterpart only in the ancient world. 


The dimensions and quality of our public buildings to-day are in 
deplorable contrast to the edifices that, represent private interests. 


If a similar fate should befall Berlin as befell Rome, future generations 
might gaze upon the ruins of some Jewish department stores or joint-stock 
hotels and think that these were the characteristic expressions of the culture of 
our time. 


In Berlin itself, compare the shameful disproportion between the 
buildings which belong to the Reich and those which have been erected for the 
accommodation of trade and finance. 


293 


The funds that are voted for public buildings are in most cases 
inadequate and really ridiculous. They are not built as structures that were 
meant to last, but mostly for the purpose of answering the need of the moment. 


No higher idea influenced those who commissioned such buildings. 


At the time the Berlin Schloss was built, it had quite a different 
significance to that which the new library has for our time, seeing that one 
battleship alone represents an expenditure of about sixty million marks, 
whereas less than half that sum was allotted for the building of the Reichstag, 
the most imposing structure erected for the Reich, which should have been 
built to last for ages. 


Yet, in deciding the question of internal decoration, the august House 
voted against the use of stone and ordered that the walls should be covered 
with stucco. 


For once, however, the parliamentarians made an appropriate decision 
on that occasion, for wooden heads would be out of place between stone 
walls. 


The community as such is not the dominant characteristic of our 
contemporary cities, and therefore it is not to be wondered at if the community 
does not find itself architecturally represented. Thus we must eventually arrive 
at a veritable civic desert which will finally be reflected in the total 
indifference of the individual citizen towards his own city. 


This is also a sign of our cultural decay and general break-up. 


Our era is entirely preoccupied with petty materialistic considerations, 
or rather it is entirely preoccupied with the question of money. 


Therefore, it is not to be wondered at if, with the worship of such an 
idol, the sense of heroism should entirely disappear, but the present is only 
reaping what the past had sown. 


All these symptoms which preceded the final collapse of the Second 
Reich must be attributed to the lack of a definite and uniformly accepted 
Weltanschauung and the general uncertainty of outlook consequent on that lack. 


This uncertainty showed itself when the great questions of the time had to 
be considered one after another and a decisive policy adopted towards them. 


294 


This lack is also .accountable for the habit of doing everything by halves, 
beginning with the educational system, the shilly-shallying, the reluctance to 
undertake responsibility and, finally, the cowardly tolerance of evils that were 
even admitted to be destructive. 


Visionary humanitarianism became the fashion. By weakly submitting to 
these aberrations and sparing the feelings of the individual, the future of 
millions of human beings was sacrificed. 


An examination of the religious situation before the War shows that the 
general process of disruption had extended to this sphere also. A great part of 
the nation itself had, for a long time past, ceased to have any convictions of a 
uniform and practical character in their ideological outlook on life. 


In this matter the point of primary importance was by no means the 
number of people who renounced their church membership, but rather the 
widespread indifference. 


While the two Christian denominations maintained missions in Asia and 
Africa, for the purpose of securing new adherents to the faith, these same 
denominations were losing millions and millions of their adherents at home in 
Europe. 


These former adherents either gave up religion wholly as a directive 
force in their lives, or they adopted their own interpretation of it. 


The consequences of this were specially felt in the moral life of the 
country. In parenthesis it may be remarked that the progress made by the 
missions in spreading the Christian faith abroad was very modest in 
comparison with the spread of Mohammedanism. 


It must be noted, too, that the attack on the dogmatic principles 
underlying ecclesiastical teaching increased steadily in violence, and yet this 
human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of 
a religious belief. 


The great masses of a nation are not composed of philosophers. For the 
masses of the people especially, faith is absolutely the only basis of a moral 
Weltanschauung. The various substitutes that have been offered have not 
shown any results that might warrant us in thinking that they might usefully 
replace the existing denominations, but if religious teaching and religious faith 
are to be accepted by the broad masses as active forces in their lives, then the 


295 


absolute authority of the doctrines of faith must be the foundation of all reality. 


There may be a few hundreds of thousands of superior men who can live 
wisely and intelligently without depending on the general standards that 
prevail in everyday life, but the millions of others cannot do so. 


Now, the place which general custom fills in everyday life, corresponds 
to that of general laws in the State and dogma in religion. 


The purely spiritual idea is of itself a changeable thing that may be 
subjected to endless interpretations. It is only through dogma that it is givena 
precise and concrete form without which it could not become a living faith. 


Otherwise, the spiritual idea would never become anything more than a 
mere metaphysical concept, or rather a philosophical opinion. 


Accordingly, the attack on dogma is comparable to an attack on the 
general laws on which the State is founded, and so this attack would finally 
lead to complete political anarchy if it were successful, just as the attack on 
religion would lead to a worthless religious nihilism. 


The political leader should not estimate the worth of a religion by taking 
some of its shortcomings into account, but should ask himself whether there be 
any practical substitute which is obviously better. Until such a substitute is 
available only fools and criminals would think of abolishing the existing 
religion. 


Undoubtedly, no small amount of blame for the present unsatisfactory 
religious situation must be attributed to those who have encumbered the ideal 
of religion with purely material accessories and have thus given rise to an 
utterly futile conflict between religion and science. 


In this conflict, victory will nearly always be on the side of science, 
although after a bitter struggle, while religion will suffer heavily in the eyes of 
those who cannot penetrate beneath mere superficial learning. 


The greatest damage of all has come from the practice of abusing 
religious conviction in order to further political aims. Most severe measures 
should be adopted against these miserable swindlers who look on religion 
merely as a means that can be exploited to serve political interests, or rather 
commercial ends. 


296 


The impudent and loud-mouthed liars who do this make their profession 
of faith before the whole world in stentorian tones so that all poor mortals may 
hear-not that they are ready to die for it if necessary, but rather that they may 
live all the better. 


They are ready to sell their faith for any political quid pro quo. For ten 
parliamentary mandates they would ally themselves with the Marxists, who are 
the mortal foes of all religion, and for a seat in the Cabinet they would go the 
length of wedlock with the devil, if the latter had not still retained some traces 
of decency which would lead him to refuse. If religious life in pre-war 
Germany had a disagreeable savour in the mouths of many people, this was 
because Christianity had been lowered to base uses by political parties that 
called themselves Christian and because of the shameful way in which they 
tried to identify the Catholic Faith with a political party. 


This substitution was fatal. It procured some worthless parliamentary 
mandates for the party in question, but the Church suffered damage thereby. 


The consequences of that situation had to be borne by the whole nation, 
for the laxity that resulted in religious life set in at a juncture when everything 
was beginning to lose stability and vacillate, and the traditional foundations of 
custom and of morality were threatening to fall asunder. 


Yet all those cracks and clefts in the social organism might not have been 
dangerous if no grave burdens had been laid upon it; but they became 
disastrous when the internal solidarity of the nation was the most important 
factor in withstanding the storm of big events. 


In the political field also, observant eyes might have noticed certain 
faults in the Reich which foretold disaster unless some alteration and 
correction took place in time. 


The lack of orientation in German policy, both domestic and foreign, was 
obvious to everyone who was not purposely blind. 


The best thing that could be said about the practice of making 
compromises is that it seemed outwardly to be in harmony with Bismarck’s 
saying that politics is the art of accomplishing the possible, but Bismarck was 
a slightly different man from the Chancellors who followed him. 


This difference allowed the former to apply that formula to the very 
essence of his policy, while in the mouths of the others it took on an utterly 


297 


different significance. 


When he uttered that phrase, Bismarck meant to say that in order to attain 
a definite political end all possible means should be employed, or at least that 
all possibilities should be investigated, but his successors saw in that phrase 
only a solemn declaration that one is not necessarily bound to have political 
principles or any definite political aims at all. 


The political leaders of the Reich at that time had no far-seeing policy. 
Here again, the necessary foundation was lacking, namely, a definite 
Weltanschauung, and those leaders also lacked that clear insight into the laws 
of political evolution which is a necessary quality in political leadership. 


Many people who took a gloomy view of things at that time condemned 
the lack of ideas and lack of orientation which were evident in directing the 
policy of the Reich. They recognised the inner weakness and futility of this 
policy, but such people played only a secondary role in politics. 


Those who had the government of the country in their hands were quite 
as indifferent to principles of civil wisdom laid down by thinkers like Houston 
Stewart Chamberlain as are our political leaders to-day. These people are too 
stupid to think for themselves, and they have too much self-conceit to take from 
others the instruction which they need. Oxenstierna gave expression to a truth 
which has lasted since time immemorial, when he said that the world is 
governed by only a particle of wisdom, and it can be said of practically every 
higher government official that he represents but a tiny atom of this particle. 


Since Germany became a Republic even this modicum is wanting, and 
that 1s why they had to promulgate the Law for the Defence of the Republic, 
which prohibits the holding of such views or the expression of them. 


It was fortunate for Oxenstierna that he lived at that time and not in this 
wise Republic of our day. Even before the war that institution which should 
have represented the strength of the Reich—the parliament, the Reichstag— 
was widely recognised as its weakest feature. Cowardliness and fear of 
shouldering responsibilities were associated together there to perfection. 


One of the silliest notions that one hears expressed to-day is that in 
Germany the parliamentary system has proved a failure since the Revolution. 


This might easily be taken to imply that the case was different before the 
Revolution, but in reality the parliamentary system can never function except to 


298 


the detriment of the country, and it functioned thus in those days when people 
saw nothing or did not wish to see anything. 


The German downfall is to be attributed in no small degree, to this 
system, but that the catastrophe did not take place sooner is not to the credit of 
the Reichstag, but rather to those who opposed the influence of this institution 
which, during peace time, was digging the grave of the German Nation and the 
German Reich. 


From the immense mass of devastating evils that were due either directly 
or indirectly to the Reichstag, I shall select the one most intimately typical of 
this institution which was the most irresponsible of all time. 


The evil I speak of was seen in the appalling shilly-shally and weakness 
in conducting the internal and external affairs of the Reich. It was attributable 
in the first place to the action of the Reichstag and was one of the principal 
causes of the political collapse. 


Everything subject to the influence of this parliament was done by 
halves, no matter from what aspect you may regard it. The foreign policy of the 
Reich in the matter of alliances was an example of shilly-shally. They wished 
to maintain peace, but in doing so, they steered straight for war. 


Their Polish policy was also carried out by half-measures. It acted as an 
irritant, but achieved no positive results. It resulted neither in a German 
triumph nor a Polish conciliation, and it made enemies of the Russians. 


They tried to solve the Alsace-Lorraine question through half-measures. 
Instead of crushing the head of the French hydra once and for all with the 
mailed fist and granting Alsace-Lorraine equal rights with the other German 
states, they did neither the one nor the other. 


Anyhow, it was impossible for them to do otherwise, for they had among 
their ranks the greatest traitors to the country, such as Herr Wetterlé of the 
Centre Party. 


But still the country might have been able to bear with all this provided 
the half-measure policy had not victimized that force on which, as the last 
resort, the existence of the Reich depended, namely, the Army. 


The crime committed by the so-called German Reichstag in this regard 
was sufficient of itself to draw down upon it the curses of the German nation 


299 


for all time. On the most miserable of pretexts these parliamentary party- 
henchmen filched from the hands of the nation and threw away, the weapons 
which were needed to maintain its existence and thereby defend the liberty and 
independence of our people. 


If the graves on the plains of Flanders were to open to-day the blood- 
stained accusers would arise, hundreds of thousands of our best German youth 
who, thanks to those conscienceless parliamentary criminals were delivered, 
badly trained or only half-trained, into the arms of Death. 


Those youths and other millions of the killed and mutilated were lost to 
the Fatherland simply and solely in order that a few hundred deceivers of the 
people might carry out their political manoeuvres and their exactions, or even 
continue to recite their doctrinaire theories. 


By means of the Marxist and democratic press, the Jews spread the 
colossal falsehood about ‘German militarism’ throughout the world and tried to 
inculpate Germany by every possible means, while at the same time the 
Marxist and democratic parties refused to assent to the measures that were 
necessary for the adequate training of our national defence forces. 


The appalling crime thus committed by these persons ought to have been 
obvious to everybody who foresaw that in case of war the whole nation would 
have to be called to arms and that, because of the mean huckstering of these 
noble ‘representatives of the people,’ as they called themselves, millions of 
Germans would have to face the enemy ill-equipped and insufficiently trained. 


But, even apart from the consequences of the crude and brutal lack of 
conscience which these parliamentarian rascals displayed, it was quite clear 
that the lack of properly trained soldiers at the beginning of a war would most 
probably lead to the loss of the said war; and this probability was confirmed in 
a most terrible way during the course of the World War. 


Therefore, the German people lost the struggle for the freedom and 
independence of their country because of the half-hearted and defective policy 
employed during times of peace in the organisation and training of the 
defensive strength of the nation. 


The number of recruits trained for the land forces was too small, but the 
same half-heartedness was shown in regard to the Navy and made this weapon 
of national self-preservation more or less ineffective. 


300 


Unfortunately, even the naval authorities themselves were contaminated 
with this spirit of half-heartedness. The tendency to build the ship on the stocks 
somewhat smaller than that just launched by the British showed little foresight 
and less genius. 


A fleet which cannot be brought to the same numerical strength as that of 
the probable enemy ought to compensate for this inferiority by the superior 
fighting power of the individual ship. 


It is the weight of the fighting power that counts and not any sort of 
traditional quality. As a matter of fact, modem technical development is so 
advanced and so well-proportioned among the various civilised States that it 
must be looked on as practically impossible for one Power to build vessels 
which would have a superior fighting quality to that of the vessels of equal size 
built by the other Powers. 


It is even less feasible to build vessels of smaller displacement which 
will be superior in action to those of larger displacement. As a matter of fact, 
the smaller proportions of the German vessels could be maintained only at the 
expense of speed and armament. The phrase used to justify this policy was in 
itself evidence of the lack of logical thinking on the part of the naval authorities 
who were in charge of these matters in times of peace. They declared that the 
German guns were definitely superior to the British, so that the German 28 cm. 
gun was just as effective as the British 30.5 cm. gun. 


But that was just why they should have adopted the policy of building 
30.5 cm. guns also; for it ought to have been their object not to achieve 
equality, but superiority, in fighting strength. 


If that were not so, then it would have been superfluous to equip the land 
forces with 42 cm. mortars, since the German 21 cm. mortar was far superior 
to any high-angle guns which the French possessed at that time and 
consequently the fortresses could probably have been taken by means of 30.5 
cm. mortars. 


The army authorities calculated correctly, the naval authorities 
unfortunately failed to do so. If they were willing to forego superiority of 
armaments as well as of speed, this was because of the fundamentally false 
‘principle of risk’ which they adopted. 


The naval authorities, even in times of peace, renounced the principle of 


301 


attack and thus had to follow a defensive policy from the very beginning of the 
war, but by this attitude they renounced also the chances of final success, 
which can be achieved only by taking the offensive. A vessel of slower speed 
and weaker armament will be crippled and battered by an adversary that is 
faster and stronger at a distance which gives the latter an advantage. 


A large number of cruisers have been through bitter experiences of this 
kind. How wrong the ideas prevalent among the naval authorities in times of 
peace were, was proved during the war. 


They were compelled to modify the armament of the old vessels and to 
equip the new ones with better armament whenever there was a chance to do 
SO. 


If the German vessels in the Battle of Jutland had been of equal size, the 
same armament and the same speed as the British, the British Fleet would have 
gone down under the tempest of German 38 cm. shells, which hit their mark 
more accurately and were more effective. 


Japan had followed a different kind of naval policy. There, as a matter of 
principle, care was taken to create with every single new vessel a fighting 
force that would be superior to that of the eventual adversaries, but because of 
this policy, it was afterwards possible to use the fleet for the offensive. 


While the army authorities refused to adopt such fundamentally 
erroneous principles, the Navy—which unfortunately had more representatives 
in parliament—succumbed to the spirit that ruled there. 


The Navy was not organised on a strong basis, and it was later used in 
an unsystematic and irresolute way. The immortal glory which the Navy won, 
in spite of these drawbacks, must be entirely credited to the good work, the 
efficiency and incomparable heroism of officers and crews. 


If its former commanders-in-chief had been, inspired with a like degree 
of genius, all the sacrifices would not have been in vain. 


It was probably the very parliamentarian skill displayed by the chief of 
the Navy during the years of peace which later became the cause of the fatal 
collapse, since parliamentarian considerations had begun to play a more 
important role in the construction of the Navy than fighting considerations. 


The irresolution, the weakness and the failure to adopt a logically 


302 


consistent policy, which is typical of the parliamentary system, contaminated 
the naval authorities. 


As I have already emphasised, the military authorities did not allow 
themselves to be led astray by such fundamentally erroneous ideas. 


Ludendorff, who was then a colonel on the General Staff, led a desperate 
struggle against the criminal vacillations with which the Reichstag treated the 
most vital problems of the nation, and in most cases voted against them. 


If the fight which this officer then waged remained unsuccessful, this 
must be ascribed to the parliament and partly also to the wretched and weak 
attitude of the Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg. 


Yet those who are responsible for Germany’s collapse do not hesitate 
now to lay the blame on the shoulders of the one man who took a firm stand 
against the neglectful manner in which the interests of the nation were 
managed, but one falsehood more or less makes no difference to these born 
tricksters. Anybody who thinks of all the sacrifices which this nation has had to 
bear, as a result of the criminal neglect of those irresponsible individuals; 
anybody who thinks of the number of those who died or were maimed 
unnecessarily; anybody who thinks of the deplorable shame and dishonour 
which has been heaped upon us and of the illimitable distress into which our 
people are now plunged—anybody who realises that all this had to happen in 
order to prepare the way to a seat in parliament for some unscrupulous 
placehunters and “pushers’, will understand that such hirelings can be called 
by no other name than that of rascal and criminal, for otherwise those words 
would have no meaning. 


In comparison with traitors who betrayed the nation’s trust, every other 
kind of twister may be looked upon as an honourable man. 


It was a peculiar feature of the situation that all the real faults of the old 
Germany were exposed to the public gaze only when the inner solidarity of the 
nation could be injured by doing so. Then indeed unpleasant truths were openly 
proclaimed in the ears of the broad masses, while many other things were at 
other times shamefully hushed up or their existence simply denied, especially 
at times when an open discussion of such problems might have led to an 
improvement. 


The higher government authorities knew little or nothing of the nature and 


303 


use of propaganda in such matters. Only the Jew knew that by an able and 
persistent use of propaganda, heaven itself can be presented to the people as if 
it were hell and, vice versa, the most miserable kind of life can be presented 
as if it were paradise. 


The Jew knew this and acted accordingly, but the German, or rather his 
government, did not have the slightest suspicion of it. 


During the war, the heaviest of penalties had to be paid for that 
ignorance. Over against the innumerable drawbacks which I have mentioned 
here and which affected German life before the war there were many 
outstanding features on the positive side. 


If we take an impartial survey, we must admit that most of our drawbacks 
were in great measure prevalent also in other countries and among the other 
nations, and very often in a worse form than with us, whereas among us there 
were many real advantages which the others did not have. 


Chief among Germany’s advantages was the fact that, of all the European 
nations, the German nation was almost the only one which had made a great 
effort to preserve the national character of its economic structure and for this 
reason was less subject than other countries to the power of international 
finance, though indeed there were many untoward symptoms in this regard 
also, and yet this advantage was a perilous one and turned out later to be one 
of the chief causes of the World War. Even if we disregard this advantage of 
national independence in economic matters, there were certain other positive 
features of our social and political life which were of outstanding excellence. 


These features were represented by three institutions which were 
constant sources of regeneration. In their respective spheres they were models 
of perfection and efficiency. 


The first of these was the constitution as such and the manner in which it 
had been developed in Germany in modern times. Of course we must except 
those monarchs who, as human beings, were subject to the failings which 
afflict this world and its children. 


If we were not so tolerant in these matters, then the case of the present 
generation would be hopeless, nor if we take into consideration the personal 
capabilities and character of the representative figures in our present regime, it 
would be difficult to imagine a more modest level of intelligence and moral 


304 


character. 


If we measure the ‘valise’ of the German Revolution by the personal 
worth and calibre of the individuals whom this revolution has presented to the 
German people since November 1918, then we may feel ashamed indeed in 
thinking of the judgment which posterity will pass on these individuals, when 
the Law for the Protection of the Republic can no longer silence public 
opinion. 


Coming generations will surely decide that the intelligence and integrity 
of our new German leaders were in inverse ratio to their boasting and their 
vices. 


It must be admitted that the monarchy had become alien in spirit to many 
citizens and especially to the broad masses. This resulted from the fact that the 
monarchs were not always surrounded by, let us say, the highest intellect and 
certainly not always by persons of the most upright character. 


Unfortunately, many of them preferred flatterers to honest-spoken men 
and hence received their ‘information’ from the former. This was a source of 
grave danger at a time when the world was passing through a period in which 
many of the old conditions were changing and when this change was affecting 
even the traditions of the Court. 


The average man or woman could not have felt any particular enthusiasm 
when, for example, at the close of the century, a princess in uniform and on 
horseback had the soldiers file past her on parade. 


Those high circles had apparently no idea of the impression which such 
a parade made on the minds of ordinary people, else such unfortunate 
occurrences would not have taken place. 


The sentimental humanitarianism—not always very sincere—which was 
professed in those high circles was often more repulsive than attractive. 


When, for instance, the Princess X condescended to taste the products of 
a soup-kitchen and found them excellent, as usual, such a gesture might have 
made an excellent impression in times long past, but on this occasion it had the 
opposite effect to that which was intended, for, even if we take it for granted 
that Her Highness did not have the slightest idea that, on the day she sampled 
it, the food was not quite the same as on other days, it sufficed that the people 
knew it. 


305 


Even the best of intentions thus became an object of ridicule or a cause 
of exasperation. 


Descriptions of the proverbial frugality practised by the monarch, his 
much too early rise in the morning and the drudgery he had to go through all 
day long until late at night, and especially the constantly expressed fears lest he 
might become undernourished—all this gave rise to ominous remarks on the 
part of the people. 


Nobody was keen to know what and how much the monarch ate or drank. 
Nobody grudged him a full meal, or the necessary amount of sleep. 


Everybody was pleased when the monarch, as a man and a personality, 
brought honour on his family and his country and fulfilled his duties as a 
sovereign. All the legends which were circulated about him helped little and 
did much damage. 


These and such things, however, are mere bagatelles: What was much 
worse was the feeling, which spread throughout large sections of the nation, 
that the affairs of the individual were being taken care of from above and that 
he did not need to bother himself with them. 


As long as the government was really good, or at least moved by 
goodwill, no serious objections could be raised, but the country was destined 
to disaster when the old government, which had at least striven for the best, 
was replaced by a new regime which was not of the same quality. 


Then the docile obedience and infantile credulity which formerly offered 
no resistance was bound to be one of the most fatal evils that can be imagined. 


In contrast to these and other defects there were, however, certain 
qualities which undoubtedly had a positive effect. 


First of all, the monarchical form of government guarantees stability in 
the direction of public affairs and safeguards public offices from the 
speculative turmoil of ambitious politicians. 


Furthermore, the venerable tradition which this institution possesses, 
arouses a feeling which gives it weight and authority. 


Beyond this there is the fact that the whole corps of officials, and the 
Army in particular, are raised above the level of political party obligations, 


306 


and still another positive feature was that the supreme rulership of the State 
was embodied in the monarch, as an individual person, who could serve as the 
symbol of responsibility which a monarch has to bear more seriously than any 
anonymous parliamentary majority. Indeed, the proverbial honesty and integrity 
of the German administration must be attributed chiefly to this fact. Finally, the 
monarchy fulfilled a high cultural function among the German people, which 
made amends for many of its defects. 


The German residential cities have remained, given in our time, centres 
of that artistic spirit which now threatens to disappear and is becoming more 
and more materialistic. 


The German princes gave a great deal of excellent and practical 
encouragement to art and science, especially during the nineteenth century. Our 
present age certainly has nothing of equal worth. 


During that process of disintegration which was slowly extending 
throughout the social order, the most positive factor was the Army. This was 
the strongest source of education which the German people possessed. 


For that reason all the hatred of our enemies was directed against this 
defender of our national self-preservation and our liberty. The strongest 
testimony in favour of this unique institution is the fact that it was derided, 
hated and fought against, but also feared, by worthless elements all round. 


The fact that the international profiteers who gathered at Versailles, 
further to exploit and plunder the nations, directed their enmity specially 
against the old German Army, proved once again that it deserved to be 
regarded as the institution which protected the liberties of our people against 
the forces of the International Stock Exchange. 


If the Army had not been there to sound—the alarm and stand on guard, 
the aims of the Versailles representatives would have been carried out much 
sooner. 


There is only one word to express what the German people owes to this 
Army—everything! 


It was the Army that still kept a sense of responsibility alive among the 
people when this quality had become very rare and when the, habit of shirking 
every kind of responsibility was steadily spreading. 


307 


This habit had grown up under the evil influences of parliament, which 
was itself the very model of irresponsibility. 


The Army trained the people to personal courage at a time when the 
virtue of timidity threatened to become an epidemic and when the spirit of 
sacrificing one’s personal interests for the good of the community was 
considered as something that amounted almost to weak-mindedness. 


At a time when only those were estimated as intelligent who knew how 
to safeguard and promote their own egotistic interests, the Army was the 
school through which individual Germans were taught not to seek the salvation 
of their nation in the false ideology of international fraternisation between 
Negroes, Germans, Chinese, French and English, etc., but in the strength and 
unity of their own national being. 


The Army developed the individual’s powers of resolute decision, and 
this at a time when a spirit of indecision and scepticism governed human 
conduct. At a time when the wiseacres were everywhere setting the fashion, it 
needed courage to uphold the principle that any command is better than none. 


This one principle represents a robust and sound style of thought, of 
which not a trace would have been left in the other branches of life if the Army 
had not furnished a constant source of this fundamental strength. 


A sufficient proof of this may be found in the appalling lack of decision 
which our present government authorities display. They cannot shake off their 
mental and moral lethargy and decide on some definite line of action, except 
when they are forced to sign some new dictate for the exploitation of the 
German people. 


In that case they decline all responsibility, while at the same time they 
sign everything which the other side places before them, and they sign with the 
readiness of an official stenographer. 


Their conduct is here explicable, on the ground, that, in this case, they 
are not under the necessity of coming to a decision, for the decision is dictated 
to them. 


The Army imbued its members with a spirit of idealism and developed 
their readiness to sacrifice themselves for their country and its honour, while 
greed and materialism dominated in all the other branches of life. 


308 


The Army united a people which was split up into classes, and in this 
respect had only one defect, which was the one-year term of voluntary military 
service, a privilege granted to those who had passed through the higher grade 
schools. 


It was a defect, because the principle of absolute equality was thereby 
violated, and those who had a better education were thus placed outside the 
cadres to which the rest of their comrades belonged. The reverse would have 
been better. 


Since our upper classes were really ignorant of what was going on in the 
body corporate of the nation and were becoming more and more estranged 
from the life of the people, the Army would have accomplished a very 
beneficial mission if it had refused to discriminate in favour of the so-called 
intellectuals, especially within its own ranks. 


It was a mistake that this was not done, but can we in this world of ours 
find any institution that has nit at least one defect? And in the Army, the good 
features were so absolutely predominant that the few defects it had, were far 
below the average that generally arises from human weakness. 


The greatest merit of the Army of the old Reich was that, at a time when 
the person of the individual counted for nothing and the majority was 
everything, it placed individual personal values above majority values. 


By insisting on its faith in personality, the Army opposed that typically 
Jewish and democratic apotheosis of the power of numbers. 


The Army trained what at that time was most sorely needed, namely, real 
men. During a period when men were falling prey to effeminacy and laxity, 
three hundred and fifty thousand vigorously trained young men went forth from 
the ranks of the Army each year. 


In the course of their two years training they had lost the softness of their 
young days and had developed bodies as tough as steel. The young man who 
had been taught obedience for two years was now fitted to command. The 
trained soldier could be recognised even by his walk. 


This was the great school of the German nation, and it was not without 
reason that it drew upon its head all the bitter hatred of those who wanted the 
Reich to be weak and defenceless, because they were jealous of its greatness 
and were themselves possessed by a spirit of rapacity and greed. 


309 


The rest of the world recognised a fact which many Germans did not 
wish to see, either because they were blind to facts or because, out of malice, 
they did not wish to see it. 


This fact was that the German Army was the most powerful weapon for 
the defence and freedom of the German nation and the best guarantee for the 
livelihood of its citizens. 


There was a third institution of positive worth, which has to be 
considered apart from the monarchy and the Army. This was the unrivalled 
civil service in the old Germany. 


German administration was better organised and better carried out than 
the administration of other countries. There may have been objections to the 
bureaucratic routine of the officials, but from this point of view, the state of 
affairs was similar, if not worse, 1n the other countries. 


The other States did not have the wonderful solidarity which this 
organisation possessed in Germany, nor were their civil servants of that same 
high level of scrupulous honesty. 


It is certainly better to be a trifle over-bureaucratic, honest and loyal 
than to be over-sophisticated, modem and of an inferior type of character and, 
as often happens today, ignorant and inefficient. 


If it be insinuated to-day that the German administration of the pre-war 
period may have been excellent so far as bureaucratic technique went, but that 
from the practical business point of view it was incompetent, I can only give 
the following reply: What other country in the world possessed a better- 
organised and administered business enterprise than the German State 
Railways, for instance? 


It was left to the Revolution to destroy this model organisation, until the 
time was ripe for it to be taken out of the hands of the nation and 
‘nationalised,’ in the sense which the founders of the Republic had given to 
that word, namely, making it subservient to the International Stock Exchange 
capitalists, who were the wire-pullers of the German Revolution. 


The most outstanding trait in the civil service and the whole body of the 
civil administration was its independence of the vicissitudes of government, 
the political mentality of which could exercise no influence on the attitude of 
the German State officials. 


310 


Since the Revolution, this situation has been completely changed. 
Efficiency and capability have been replaced by the test of party adherence; 
and independence of character and initiative are no longer appreciated as 
positive qualities in a public official. They rather tell against him. 


The wonderful might and power of the old Reich was based on the 
monarchical form of government, the Army and the civil service, of these three 
foundations rested that great strength which is now entirely lacking, namely, the 
authority of the State, for the authority of the State cannot be based on the 
babbling that goes on in parliament or in the provincial diets, upon laws made 
to protect the State, or upon sentences passed by the law courts to frighten 
those who have had the hardihood to deny the authority of the State, but only on 
the general confidence which the management and administration of the 
community establishes among the people. 


This confidence is, in its turn, nothing else than the result of an 
unshakable inner conviction that the government and administration of a 
country is inspired by disinterested and honest goodwill and of the feeling that 
the Spirit of the law is in complete harmony with the moral convictions of the 
people. 


In the long run, systems of government are not maintained by terrorism 
but by the belief of the people in the merits and sincerity of those who are there 
to administer and promote public interests. 


Though it is true that in the period preceding the war certain grave evils 
tended to infect and corrode the inner strength of the nation, it must be 
remembered that the other States suffered even more than Germany from these 
drawbacks, and yet those other States did not fail and break down when the 
time of crisis came. 


If we remember further that those defects in pre-war Germany were 
outweighed by great positive qualities, we shall have to look elsewhere for the 
real cause of the collapse, and it did lie elsewhere. 


The ultimate and most profound reason of the German downfall is to be 
found in the fact that the racial problem was ignored and that its importance in 
the historical development of nations was not grasped, for the events that take 
place in the life of nations are not due to chance but are the natural results of 
the effort to conserve and multiply, the species and the race, even though men 
may not be able consciously to picture in their minds the profound motives of 


311 


their conduct.

CHAPTER XI: NATION AND RACE 


There are certain truths which are so obvious that the general run of 
people disregard them. People are so blind to some of the simplest facts in 
everyday life that they are highly surprised when somebody calls attention to 
what everybody ought to know. 


Examples of the Columbus egg are around us in hundreds of thousands, 
but Columbuses are rare. 


Walking about in the garden of Nature, most men have the self-conceit to 
think that they know everything, yet almost all are blind to one of the 
outstanding principles that Nature employs in her work. 


This principle may be called the inner isolation which characterises 
each and every living species on this earth. 


Even a superficial glance is sufficient to show that all the innumerable 
forms in which the life-urge of Nature manifests itself are subject to a 
fundamental law—one may call it an iron law of Nature—which compels the 
various species to keep within the definite limits of their own life-forms when 
propagating and multiplying their kind. 


Each animal mates only with one of its own species. The titmouse 
cohabits only with the titmouse, the finch with the finch, the stork with the 
stork, the field-mouse with the field-mouse, the house-mouse with the house- 
mouse, the wolf with the she-wolf, etc. 


Deviations from this law take place only in exceptional circumstances. 
This happens especially under the compulsion of captivity, or when some other 
obstacle makes procreative intercourse impossible between individuals of the 
same species. 


Nature abhors such irregular intercourse with all her might and her 
protest is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the hybrid is either sterile, 
or the fecundity of its descendants is limited. 


In most cases hybrids and their progeny are denied the ordinary powers 
of resistance to disease or the natural means of defence against attack. 


Such a dispensation of Nature is quite logical. Every crossing of two 


316 


breeds which are not, of equal standing results in a product which holds an 
intermediate place between the levels of the two parents. 


This means that the offspring will indeed be superior to that parent 
which belongs to a biologically lower order of beings, but not so high as the 
superior parent. 


For this reason, it must eventually succumb in any struggle against the 
higher species. Such mating contradicts the will of Nature towards the 
selective improvement of life in general. 


The favourable preliminary to this improvement is not to mate 
individuals of higher and lower orders of being, but rather to allow the 
complete triumph of the higher order. 


The stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would 
signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. 


Only the born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel, and if he 
does so, it is merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind, for if 
such a law did not direct the process of evolution then the higher development 
of organic life would not be conceivable at all. 


This urge for the maintenance of the unmixed breed which is a 
phenomenon that prevails throughout the whole of the natural world, results not 
only in the sharply defined outward distinction between one species and 
another, but also in the internal similarity of characteristic qualities which are 
peculiar to each breed or species. 


The fox remains always a fox, the goose remains a goose, and the tiger 
will retain the character of a tiger. The only difference that can exist within the 
species is in the various degrees of structural strength and active power, in the 
intelligence, efficiency, endurance, etc., with which the individual specimens 
are endowed. 


It would be impossible to find a fox which has a kindly and protective 
disposition towards geese, just as no cat exists which has a friendly 
disposition towards mice. 


That is why the struggle between the various species does not arise from 
a feeling of mutual antipathy, but rather from hunger and love. 


S17 


In both cases Nature looks on calmly and is even pleased with what 
happens. The struggle for daily livelihood leaves behind in the ruck everything 
that is weak, diseased or wavering; while the fight of the male to possess the 
female gives to the strongest the right, or at least the possibility, to propagate 
its kind. 


This struggle is a means of furthering the health and powers of resistance 
of the species, thus it is one of the causes underlying the process of 
development towards a higher grade of being. If this were otherwise the 
progressive process would cease, and even retrogression might set in. 


Since the inferior always outnumber the superior, the former would 
always increase more rapidly if they possessed the same capacity for survival 
and for the procreation of their kind, and the final consequence would be that 
the best in quality would be forced to recede into the background. 


Therefore, a corrective measure must intervene in favour of the better 
quality. Nature supplies this by establishing rigorous conditions of life, to 
which the weaker will have to submit and will thereby be numerically 
restricted, but even that portion which survives cannot multiply 
indiscriminately, for here a new and rigorous selection takes place, according 
to strength and health. 


If Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with 
stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle with an 
inferior one, because in such a case all her efforts, throughout hundreds of 
thousands of years, to establish an evolutionary higher stage of being, may be 
rendered futile. 


History furnishes us with innumerable instances that prove this law. 


It shows, with startling clarity, that whenever Aryans have mingled their 
blood with that of an inferior race, the result has been the downfall of the 
people who were the champions of a higher culture. 


In North America, where the population is prevalently Teutonic, and 
where those elements intermingled with the inferior race only to a very small 
degree, we have a quality of mankind and a civilisation which are different 
from those of Central and South America. 


In these latter countries the immigrants—who belonged mainly to the 
Latin races—mated with the aborigines, sometimes to a very large extent 


318 


indeed. 


In this case, we have a clear and decisive example of the effect produced 
by the mixture of races. 


In North America the Teutonic element, which has kept its racial stock 
pure and did not mix it with any other racial stock, has come to dominate the 
American Continent and will remain master of it as long as that element does 
not fall a victim to the habit of adulterating its blood. 


In short, the results of miscegenation are always the following: 
(a) The level of the superior race becomes lowered. 


(b) Physical and mental degeneration sets in, thus leading slowly but 
steadily towards a progressive drying up of the vital, sap. 


The act which brings about such a development is a sin against the will 
of the Eternal Creator, and as a sin this act will be avenged. 


Man’s effort to build up something that contradicts the iron logic of 
Nature brings him into conflict with those principles to which he himself 
exclusively, owes his own existence. 


By acting against the laws of Nature he prepares the way that leads to his 
ruin. 


Here we meet with the insolent objection, which is Jewish in its 
inspiration and is typical of the modem pacifist, that “Man can overcome 
Nature.” 


There are millions who repeat by rote that piece of Jewish babble and 
end up by imagining that somehow they themselves are the conquerors of 
Nature. 


Yet their only weapon is a mere idea, and a very preposterous idea into 
the bargain, because if one accepted it, then it would be impossible to forma 
conception of the world. 


The real truth is, that not only has man failed to overcome Nature in any 
sphere whatsoever, but that at best he has merely succeeded in getting hold of 
and lifting a tiny corner of the enormous veil which she has spread over her 
eternal mysteries and secrets. 


319 


He never invents anything; all he can do is to discover something. He 
does not master Nature, but has only come to be master of those living beings 
who have not gained the knowledge he has arrived at by penetrating into some 
of Nature’s laws and mysteries. 


Apart from all this, an idea can never subject to its own sway those 
condition; which are necessary for the existence and development of mankind, 
for the idea itself has come only from man. 


Without man there would be no human idea in this world. The idea as 
such is, therefore, always dependent on the existence of man and is 
consequently dependent on those laws which furnish the conditions of his 
existence. 


Not only that. Certain ideas are even confined to certain people. This 
holds true with regard to those ideas, in particular, which have not their roots 
in objective scientific truth, but in the world of feeling. 


In other words, to use a phrase which is current to-day and which well 
and clearly expresses this truth: They reflect an inner experience. 


All such ideas, which have nothing to do with cold logic as such, but 
represent mere manifestations of feeling, such as ethical and moral 
conceptions, etc., are inextricably bound up with man’s existence. 


It is to the creative powers of man’s imagination that such ideas owe 
their existence. 


For this very reason, a necessary condition for the preservation of such 
ideas is the existence of certain races and certain types of men. 


For example, anyone who sincerely wishes the pacifist idea to prevail in 
this world ought to do all he 1s capable of doing to help the Germans conquer 
the world, for in case the reverse should happen, it may easily be that the last 
pacifist would disappear with the last German. 


I say this because, unfortunately, scarcely any other people in the world 
has ever fallen a prey to this nonsensical and illogical idea to the same degree 
as our own. Whether of the effect that outer circumstances have upon it. 


Then, if you are serious, whether you like it or not, you must make up 
your mind to wage wars in order to pave the way for pacifism. This was in fact 


320 


the plan of Woodrow Wilson, the American world-redeemer (at least so our 
visionaries believed) and that was all that was required. 


The pacifist-humanitarian idea may indeed become an excellent one 
when the most superior type of manhood will have succeeded in subjugating 
the world to such an extent that this type 1s then sole master of the earth. This 
idea could have an injurious effect only in the measure in which its application 
became difficult and finally impossible. 


So, first of all, the fight, and then pacifism. If it were otherwise, it would 
mean that mankind has already passed the zenith of its development, and 
accordingly, the end would not be the supremacy of some moral ideal, but 
degeneration into barbarism and consequent chaos. 


People may laugh at this statement, but our planet moved through space 
for millions of years, uninhabited by men, and at some future date may easily 
begin to do so again, if men should forget that wherever they have reached a 
superior level of existence, it was not as a result of following the ideas of 
crazy visionaries but by acknowledging and rigorously observing the iron laws 
of Nature. 


What reduces one race to starvation stimulates another to harder work. 


All the great civilisations of the past became decadent because the 
originally creative race died out, as a result of contamination of the blood. 


The most profound cause of such a decline is to be found in the fact that 
the people ignored the principle that all culture depends on men, and not the 
reverse. 


In other words, in order to preserve a certain culture, the type of 
manhood that creates such a culture must be preserved, but such a preservation 
goes hand in hand with the inexorable law that it is the strongest and the best 
who must triumph and that they have the right to endure. 


He who would live must fight. He who does not wish to fight in this 
world, where permanent struggle is the law of life, has not the right to exist. 


Such a saying may sound hard, but, after all, that is how the matter really 
stands. Yet far harder is the lot of him who believes that he can overcome 
Nature, and thus in reality insults her. Distress, misery, and disease, are her 
rejoinders. 


321 


Whoever ignores or despises the laws of race really deprives himself of 
the happiness to which he believes he can attain, for he places an obstacle in 
the victorious path of the superior race and, by so doing, he interferes with a 
prerequisite condition of, all human progress. 


Loaded with the burden of human sentiment, he falls back to the level of 
a helpless animal. 


It would be futile to attempt to discuss the question as to what race or 
races were the original champions of human culture and were thereby the real 
founders of all that we understand by the word ‘humanity.’ 


It is much simpler to deal with this question in so far as it relates to the 
present time. Here the answer is simple and clear. 


Every manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and 
technical skill, which we see before our eyes to-day, is almost, exclusively the 
product of the Aryan creative power. All that we admire in the world to-day, 
its science and its art, its technical developments and discoveries, are the 
products of the creative activities of a few peoples, and it may be true that 
their first beginnings must be attributed to one race. 


The existence of civilisation is wholly dependent on such peoples. 
Should they perish, all that makes this earth beautiful will descend with them 
into the grave. 


However great, for example, be the influence which the soil exerts on 
men, this influence will always vary according to the race on which it 
produces its effect. Dearth of soil may stimulate one race to the most strenuous 
efforts and highest achievements; while, for another race, the poverty of the 
soil may be the cause of misery, and finally of undernourishment, with all its 
consequence. 


This very fact fully justifies the conclusion that it was the Aryan alone 
who founded a superior type of humanity; therefore he represents the archetype 
of what, we understand by the term: MAN. 


He is the Prometheus of mankind, from whose shining brow the divine 
spark of genius has at all times flashed forth, always kindling anew that fire 
which, in the form of knowledge, illuminated the dark night by drawing aside 
the veil of mystery and thus showing man how to rise and become master over 
all the other beings on the earth. 


322 


Should he be forced to disappear, a profound darkness will descend on 
the earth; within a few thousand years human culture will vanish and the world 
will become a desert. 


If we divide mankind into three categories—founders of culture, 
champions of culture, and destroyers of culture—the Aryan alone can be 
considered as representing the first category. 


It was he who laid the groundwork and erected the walls of every great 
structure in human culture. Only the shape and colour of such structures are to 
be attributed to the individual characteristics of the various nations. 


It is the Aryan who has furnished the great building-stones and plans for 
the edifices of all human progress; only the way in which these plans have 
been executed 1s to be attributed to the traits of each individual race. 


Within a few decades the whole of Eastern Asia, for instance, 
appropriated a culture and called this culture its own, whereas the basis of that 
culture was the Greek mind and Teutonic technical skill as we know it. 


Only the external form—at least to a certain degree—shows the traits of 
an Asiatic inspiration. 


It is not true, as some believe, that Japan adds European technology to a 
culture of her own. The truth rather is that European science and technology are 
just decked out with the peculiar characteristics of Japanese civilisation. The 
foundations of actual life in Japan to-day are not those of the native Japanese 
culture, although this characterises the external features of the country, which 
features strike the eye of European observers on account of their fundamental 
difference from our own; but the real foundations of contemporary Japanese 
life are the enormous scientific and technical achievements of Europe and 
America, that is to say, of Aryan peoples. 


Only by adopting these achievements as the foundations of their own 
progress can the various nations of the Orient take a place in contemporary 
world progress. 


The scientific and technical achievements of Europe and America 
provide the basis on which the struggle for daily livelihood is carried on in the 
Orient. 


They provide the necessary arms and instruments for this struggle, and 


323 


only the outer forms of these instruments have become gradually adapted to 
Japanese ways of life. 


If, from to-day onwards, the Aryan influence on Japan were to cease, and 
if we suppose that Europe and America were to collapse, then the present 
progress of Japan in science and technique might still last for a short duration; 
but within a few decades the inspiration would dry up, and native Japanese 
character would triumph, while the present civilisation would become 
fossilised and fall back into the sleep from which it was aroused about seventy 
years ago, by the impact of Aryan culture. 


We may, therefore, draw the conclusion that, just as the present Japanese 
development has been due to Aryan influence, so in the immemorial past an 
outside influence and an outside culture brought into existence the Japanese 
culture of that day. 


This opinion is very strongly supported by the fact that the ancient 
civilisation of Japan actually became fossilised and petrified. 


Such a process can take place only if a people loses the racial cell 
which had originally been creative, or if the outside influence should be 
withdrawn after having awakened and maintained the first cultural 
developments in that region. 


If it be shown that a people owes the fundamental elements of its culture 
to foreign races, assimilating and elaborating such elements, and if 
subsequently that culture becomes fossilised whenever the external influence 
ceases, then such a race may be called the champion, but never the creator, of a 
culture. 


If we subject the different peoples to a strict test from this standpoint, we 
shall find that scarcely any one of them has originally created a culture, but 
almost all have been merely the recipients of a culture created elsewhere. 


This development may be depicted as always happening somewhat in the 
following way. Aryan tribes, often almost ridiculously small in number, 
subjugated foreign peoples and, stimulated by the conditions of life which their 
new country offered them (fertility, the nature of the climate, etc.), and profiting 
also by the abundance of manual labour furnished them by the inferior race, 
they developed intellectual and organising faculties which had hitherto been 
dormant in themselves. 


324 


Within the course of a few thousand years, or even centuries, they gave 
life to cultures whose characteristics completely corresponded to the character 
of the founders, though modified by adaptation to the peculiarities of the soil 
and the characteristics of the subjugated people. 


But finally the conquering race offended against the principles which 
they had first observed, namely, the preservation of their racial stock unmixed, 
and began to intermingle with the subjugated people. 


Thus they put an end to their own separate existence, for the original sin 
committed in Paradise has always been followed by the expulsion of the guilty 
parties. 


After a thousand years or more the last visible traces of those former 
masters may then be found in a lighter tint of the skin which the Aryan blood 
had bequeathed to the subjugated race, and in a fossilised culture of which 
those Aryans had been the original creators; for, just as the blood of the 
conqueror, who was a conqueror not only in body but also in spirit, became 
submerged in the blood of the subject race, so the substance disappeared from 
which the torch of human culture and progress was kindled. 


In so far as the blood of the former ruling race has left a light nuance of 
colour in the blood of its descendants, as a token and a memory, the night of 
cultural life is rendered less dim and dark by a mild light radiated from the 
products of those who were the bearers of the original fire. 


Their radiance shines across the barbarism to which the subjected race 
has reverted and might often lead the superficial observer to believe that he 
sees before him an image of the present race, when he is really looking into a 
mirror, wherein only the past is reflected. 


It may happen that in the course of their history such a people will come 
into contact a second time, and even oftener, with the original founders of their 
culture and may not even remember that distant association. 


Instinctively, the remnants of blood, left from that old ruling race will be 
drawn towards this new phenomenon, and what had formerly been possible 
only under compulsion, can now be successfully achieved in a voluntary way. 


A new cultural wave flows in and lasts until the blood of those who 
brought it becomes once again adulterated by intermixture with the originally 
conquered race. 


325 


It will be the task of those who set themselves to write a universal 
history of civilisation, to investigate history from this point of view instead of 
allowing themselves to be smothered under the mass of external data, as is 
only too often the case with our present historical science. 


This short sketch of the changes that take place among those races that 
are only the depositories of a culture, also furnishes a picture of the 
development, the activity and the disappearance of those who are the true 
founders of culture on this earth, namely the Aryans themselves. 


Just as in our daily life the so-called man of genius needs a particular 
occasion, and sometimes needs a special stimulus to bring his genius to light, 
so too, in the life of the peoples the race that has genius in it needs the occasion 
and stimulus to give that genius expression. 


In the monotony and routine of everyday life even persons of significance 
seem just like the others and do not rise beyond the average level of their 
fellow-men, but as soon as such men find themselves in a special situation 
which disconcerts and unbalances the others, the humble person of apparently 
common qualities reveals traits of genius often to the amazement of those who 
have hitherto known him in the petty round of everyday life. 


That is the reason why a prophet is seldom honoured in his own country. 


War offers an excellent occasion for observing this phenomenon. In times 
of distress, when the others despair, apparently harmless, boys suddenly spring 
up and become heroes, full of determination, undaunted in the presence of 
Death and manifesting wonderful powers of calm reflection in such 
circumstances. 


If such an hour of trial did not come, nobody would have thought that the 
soul of a hero lurked in the body of that beardless youth. A special impulse is, 
almost always necessary to bring a man of genius into the foreground. 


The sledge-hammer of Fate, which strikes down the one so easily, 
suddenly finds the counter-impact of steel when it strikes at the other, and, after 
the common shell of everyday life is broken, the core that lay hidden is 
displayed to the eyes of an astonished world. 


This surrounding world then grows perverse and will not believe that 
what had seemed so like itself is really of that different quality so suddenly 
displayed. 


326 


This is a process which is repeated probably every time a man of 
outstanding significance appears. 


Though an inventor, for example, does not establish his fame until the 
very day on which he completes his invention, it would be a mistake to believe 
that the creative genius did not become alive in him until that moment. 


From the very hour of his birth the spark of genius is alive within the 
man who has been endowed with the real creative faculty. 


True genius is an innate quality. It can never be the result of education or 
training. As I have stated already, this holds good not merely of the individual, 
but also of the race. 


Those peoples who manifest creative ability in certain periods of their 
history have always been fundamentally creative. It belongs to their very 
nature, even though this fact may escape the eyes of the superficial observer. 
Here also, recognition from outside is only the consequence of practical 
achievement. 


Since the rest of the world is incapable of recognising genius as such, it 
can only see the visible manifestations of genius in the form of inventions, 
discoveries, buildings, painting, etc., but even here a long time passes before 
recognition is given. 


Just as the individual person who has been endowed with the gift of 
genius, or at least talent of a very high order, cannot develop that gift to the 
full, until he comes under the urge of special circumstances, so in the life of the 
nations their creative capacities and powers frequently have to wait until 
certain conditions stimulate them to action. 


The most obvious example of this truth is furnished by that race which 
has been, and still is, the champion of human progress; I mMean the Aryan 
race. 


As soon as Fate brings them face to face with special circumstances their 
powers begin to develop progressively and to be manifested in tangible form. 


The characteristic cultures which they create in such circumstances are 
almost always conditioned by the soil, the climate and the people they 
subjugate. 


327 


The last factor—that of the character of the people—is the most decisive 
one. The more primitive the technical condition under which the civilizing 
process takes place, the more necessary the existence of manual labour which 
can be organised and employed so as to take the place of mechanical power. 


Had it not been possible for them to employ members of the inferior race 
which they conquered, the Aryans would never have been in a position to take 
the first steps on the road which led them to their culture of a later era; just as, 
without the help of certain suitable animals, which they were able to tame, they 
would never have come to the invention of mechanical power, which has 
subsequently enabled them to do without these animals. 


The remark that the Moor, having lone his duty, could now go, can, 
unfortunately, be applied more or less universally. 


For thousands of years the horse has been the faithful servant of man and 
has helped him to lay the foundations of human progress; but now, motor power 
has rendered the horse superfluous. 


In a few years’ time the use of the horse will cease entirely; and yet 
without its collaboration man could scarcely have reached the stage of 
development at which he now is. 


For the establishment of superior types of civilisation the members of 
inferior races formed one of the most essential prerequisites. They alone could 
supply the lack of mechanical means, without which no progress is possible. 


It is certain that the first stages of human civilisation were not based so 
much on the use of tame animals as on the employment of human beings who 
were members of an inferior race. 


Only after subjugated races were employed as slaves was a similar fate 
allotted to animals, and not vice versa, as some people would have us believe. 


At first it was the conquered enemy who had to draw the plough and only 
afterwards did the ox and horse take his place. Nobody but puling pacifists can 
consider this fact a sign of human degradation. 


Such people fail to recognise that this evolution had to take place in 
order that man might reach that degree of civilisation which these apostles now 
exploit in an attempt to make the world pay attention to their rigmarole. 


328 


The progress of mankind may be compared to the process of ascending 
an infinite ladder. One does not reach the higher level without first having 
climbed the lower rungs. 


The Aryan, therefore, had to take that road which his sense of reality 
pointed out to him, and not that of which the modern pacifist dreams. 


The path of reality is, however, difficult and hard to tread; yet it is the 
only one which finally leads to the goal where the others envisage mankind in 
their dreams. 


The real truth is that those dreamers help to lead man away from his goal 
rather than towards it. 


It was not by mere chance that the first forms of civilisation arose where 
the Aryan came into contact with inferior races, subjugated them and forced 
them to obey his command. 


The members of the inferior race became the first mechanical tools in the 
service of a growing civilisation. Thereby the way was clearly indicated 
which the Aryan had to follow. 


As a conqueror, he subjugated inferior races and turned their physical 
powers into organised channels under his own leadership, forcing them to 
follow his will and purpose. 


By imposing on them a useful, though hard, manner of employing their 
powers, he not only spared the lives of those whom he had conquered, but 
probably made their lives easier than they had been in the former state of so- 
called ‘freedom.’ 


While he ruthlessly maintained his, position as their master, he not only 
remained master, but he also preserved and advanced civilisation, for this 
depended exclusively on his inborn abilities and, therefore, on the preservation 
of the Aryan race as such. 


As soon, however, as his subjects began to rise and approach the level 
of their conqueror, a phase of which ascension was probably the use of his 
language, the barriers that had distinguished master from servant broke down. 


The Aryan neglected to maintain his own racial stock unmixed and 
thereby lost the right to live in the paradise which he himself had created. He 


329 


became submerged in the racial mixture and gradually lost his cultural 
creativeness, until he finally grew, not only mentally but also physically, more 
like the aborigines whom he had subjected, rather than his own ancestors. 


For some time he could continue to live on the capital of that culture 
which still remained; but a condition of fossilisation soon set in and he sank 
into oblivion. 


That is how cultures and empires decline and yield their places to new 
structures. 


The adulteration of the blood and racial deterioration conditioned 
thereby are the only causes that account for the decline of ancient civilisations, 
for it is never by war that nations are ruined, but by the loss of their powers of 
resistance, which are exclusively a characteristic of pure racial blood. 


In this world everything that is not of sound racial stock is like chaff. 
Every historical event in the world is nothing more nor less than a 
manifestation of the instinct of racial self-preservation, whether for weal or 
woe. 


The question as to the basic reasons for the predominant importance of 
Aryanism can be answered by pointing out that it is not so much that the Aryans 
are endowed with a stronger instinct for self-preservation, but rather that this 
manifests itself in a way which is peculiar to themselves. 


Considered from the subjective standpoint, the will to live is, of course, 
equally strong all round and only the forms in which it is expressed are 
different. 


Among the most primitive organisms the instinct for self-preservation 
does not extend beyond the care of the individual ego. 


Egotism, as we call this passion, is so predominant that it includes even 
the time element, which means that the present moment is deemed the most 
important and that nothing is left to the future. 


The animal lives only for itself, searching for food only when it feels 
hunger, and fighting only for the preservation of its own life. 


As long as the instinct for self-preservation manifests itself exclusively 
in such a way, there is no basis for the establishment of a community, not even 


330 


the most primitive form of all, that is to say, the family. 


The community formed by the male with the female, where it goes 
beyond the mere conditions of mating, calls for the extension of the instinct of 
self-preservation, since the readiness to fight for one’s own ego has to be 
extended also to the mate. 


The male sometimes provides food for the female, but in most cases both 
parents provide food for the offspring. Almost always they are ready to protect 
and defend each other, so that here we find the first, though infinitely simple, 
manifestation of the spirit of sacrifice. 


As soon as this spirit extends beyond the narrow limits of the family, we 
have the conditions under which a larger community and finally even States 
can be formed. 


The lowest species of human beings give evidence of this quality only to 
a very small degree, so that often they do not go beyond the foundation of the 
family. 


With an increasing readiness to place their immediate personal interests 
in the background, the capacity for organising more extensive communities 
develops. 


The readiness to sacrifice one’s personal work and, if necessary, even 
one’s life, for others shows its most highly developed form in the Aryan race. 


The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual powers, but 
rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the service of the 
community. 


Here the instinct for self-preservation has reached its noblest form, for 
the Aryan willingly subordinates his own ego to the common weal and, when 
necessity calls, he will even sacrifice his own life for the community. 


The constructive powers of the Aryan and that peculiar ability he has for 
the building up of a culture are not grounded in his intellectual gifts alone. 


If that were so, he might only be destructive and could never have the 
ability to organise; for the essence of organising activity consists in the 
readiness of the individual to renounce his own personal opinions and interests 
and to lay both at the service of the human group. 


331 


By serving the common weal he receives his reward in return; he does 
not, for example, work directly for himself but makes his productive work a 
part of the activity of the group to which he belongs, not only for his own 
benefit but for the general welfare. 


The spirit underlying this attitude is expressed by the word, WORK 
which to him does not at all signify a means of earning one’s daily livelihood 
but rather a productive activity which cannot clash with the interests of the 
community. 


Whenever human activity, is directed exclusively to the service of the 
instinct for self-preservation, regardless of the general weal, it is called theft, 
usury, robbery, burglary, and so on. 


This mental attitude, which forces self-interest to recede into the 
background in favour of the common weal, is the first prerequisite for any kind 
of really human civilisation. 


It is out of this spirit alone that great human achievements have sprung, 
for which the original doers have scarcely ever received any recompense, but 
which turn out to be the source of abundant benefit for their descendants. It is 
this spirit alone which can explain why it so often happens that people can 
endure a harsh but honest existence which offers them no return for their toil 
except a poor and modest livelihood, but such a livelihood helps to 
consolidate the foundations on which the community exists. 


Every worker, every peasant, every inventor, every government official, 
etc., who works without ever achieving fortune or prosperity for himself, is a 
representative of this sublime ideal, even though he may never become 
conscious of the profound meaning of his own activity. 


Everything that may be said of that kind of work which is the 
fundamental condition for providing food and the basic means of human 
progress is true even in a higher sense of work that is done for the protection of 
man and his civilisation. 


The renunciation of one’s own life for the sake of the community is the 
crowning significance of the idea of all sacrifice. In this way only 1s it 
possible to protect what has been built up by man and to ensure that this will 
not be destroyed by the hand of man or of Nature. 


In the German language we have a word which admirably expresses the 


332 


significance underlying all work. It is Pflichterfullung (fulfilment of duty), 
which means the service of the common weal before the consideration of one’s 
own interests. 


The fundamental spirit out of which this kind of activity springs is the 
reverse of ‘egotism,’ and we call it ‘idealism.’ By this we mean to signify the 
willingness of the individual to, make sacrifices for the community and his 
fellow-men. 


It is of the utmost importance to insist again and again, that idealism is 
not merely a superfluous manifestation of sentiment, but rather something 
which has been, is and always will be, a necessary precondition of human 
civilisation; it is to this that the very conception ‘human’ owes its origin. 


To this kind of mentality the Aryan owes his position in the world, and, 
the world is indebted to the Aryan mind for having developed the concept of 
‘mankind,’ for it was out of this spirit alone that the creative force grew, which 
in a unique way, combined robust muscular power with a first-class intellect, 
and thus created the monuments of human civilisation. 


Were it not for idealism, all the faculties of the intellect, even the most 
brilliant, would be nothing but intellect itself, a mere external phenomenon 
without inner value, and never a creative force. 


Since true idealism, however, is essentially the subordination of the 
interests and life of the individual to the interests and life of the community, 
and since this subordination in turn represents the prerequisite condition for 
every form of organisation, this idealism accords in its innermost essence with 
the final purpose of Nature. 


This idealism alone makes men voluntarily acknowledge, that strength 
and power are entitled to take the lead and makes them a constituent particle of 
that order out of which the whole universe is shaped and formed. 


Without being conscious of it, the purest idealism is always associated 
with the most profound knowledge. How True this is and how little genuine 
idealism has to do with fantastic self-dramatization will become clear the 
moment we ask an unspoilt child, a healthy boy, for example, to give his 
opinion. 


The very same boy who listens to the rantings of an ‘idealistic’ pacifist 
without understanding them, and even rejects them, would readily sacrifice his 


333 


young life for the ideal of his people. 


Unconsciously, his instinct will submit to the knowledge that the 
preservation of the species, even at the cost of the individual life, is a primal 
necessity and he will protest against the fantasies of pacifist ranters, who are 
in reality nothing better than cowardly, though camouflaged, egotists, who 
contradict the laws of human development. 


It is an essential aspect of human evolution that the individual should be 
imbued with the spirit of sacrifice in favour of the common weal that he: 
should not be influenced by the morbid notions of those who pretend to know 
better than Nature and who have the impudence to criticise her decrees. 


It is just at those junctures when the idealistic attitude threatens to 
disappear that we notice a weakening of this force which is a necessary 
constituent in the founding and maintenance of the community and 1s therefore a 
necessary condition of civilisation. 


As soon as the spirit of egotism begins to prevail among a people, then 
the bonds of the social order break, and man, by seeking his own personal 
happiness, tumbles out of heaven and falls into hell. 


Posterity will not remember those who pursued only their own 
individual interests, but it will praise those heroes who renounced their own 
happiness. 


The Jew offers the most striking contrast to the Aryan. There is probably 
no other people in the world which has so developed the instinct of self- 
preservation as the so-called ‘chosen’ race. 


The best proof of this statement is to be found in the simple fact that this 
race still exists. Where is another people to be found that in the course of the 
last two thousand years has undergone so few changes in mental, outlook and 
character as the ‘Jewish people? 


And yet what other people has played such a constant part in the great 
revolutions? Even after having passed through the most gigantic catastrophes 
that have overwhelmed mankind, the Jews remain the same as ever. 


What an infinitely tenacious will to live, to preserve one’s kind, is 
demonstrated by that fact! 


334 


The intellectual faculties of the Jew have been trained throughout 
thousands of years. To-day the Jew is looked upon as especially ‘clever’ and 
in a certain sense, he has been so throughout the ages. 


His intellectual powers, however, are not the result of an inner evolution 
but have rather been shaped by the object lessons which he has received from 
others. 


The human spirit cannot climb upwards without taking successive steps. 
For every step upwards it needs the foundation of what has been constructed 
before, namely, the past, which, in the comprehensive sense here employed, 
can have been laid only by a general civilisation. 


All thinking originates only to a very small degree in personal 
experience. The largest part is based on the accumulated experiences of the 
past. 


The general level of civilisation provides the individual, who, in most 
cases, is not consciously aware of the fact, with such an abundance of 
preliminary knowledge, that with this equipment he can more easily take 
further steps on the road of progress. 


The boy of to-day, for example, grows up among such an overwhelming 
mass of technical achievement, which has accumulated during the last century, 
that he takes for granted many things which, a hundred years ago, were still 
mysteries even to the greatest minds of those times. 


Yet these things that are now so much a matter of course are of enormous 
importance to those who would understand the progress we have made in 
certain spheres and would carry that progress a step farther. 


If a man of genius belonging to the twenties of the last century were to 
rise from his grave to-day, he would find it more difficult to understand our 
present age than the contemporary boy of fifteen years of age who may even 
have only an average intelligence. 


The man of genius, thus come back from the past, would need to provide 
himself with an extraordinary, amount of preliminary information which our 
contemporary youth receives automatically, so to speak, during the time it is 
growing up among the products of our modern civilisation. 


Since the Jew—for reasons that I shall deal with immediately—never 


=) 


had a civilisation of his own, he has always been furnished by others with a 
basis for his intellectual work. 


His intellect has always been developed by the use of those cultural 
achievements which he has found ready to hand around him. The process has 
never been the reverse. 


Although among the Jews the instinct of self-preservation has not been 
weaker, but much stronger than among other peoples, and although the 
impression may easily be created that the intellectual powers of the Jew are at 
least equal to those of other races, the Jews completely lack the most essential 
prerequisite of a cultural people, namely, the idealistic spirit. 


With the Jewish people the spirit of self-sacrifice does not extend 
beyond the simple instinct of individual preservation. 


In their case, the feeling of racial solidarity which they apparently 
manifest, is nothing but a very primitive gregarious instinct, similar to that 
which may be found among other organisms in this world. 


It is a remarkable fact that this herd instinct brings individuals together 
for mutual protection, only as long as there is a common danger which makes 
mutual assistance expedient or inevitable. 


The same pack of wolves which, a moment ago, joined together in a 
common attack on their victim will dissolve into individual wolves as soon as 
their hunger has been satisfied. 


This is also true of horses, which unite to defend themselves against any 
aggressor, but separate the moment the danger is over. 


It is much the same with the Jew. His spirit of sacrifice is only apparent. 
It manifests itself only as long as the existence of the individual makes this a 
matter of absolute necessity, but as soon as the common foe is conquered, the 
danger which threatened the individual Jew overcome and the prey secured, 
then the apparent harmony disappears and the original conditions obtain again. 


Jews act in concord only when a common danger threatens them or a 
common prey attracts them. Where these two motives no longer exist, then the 
most brutal egotism appears and these people, who had previously lived 
together in unity, will turn into a swarm of rats that fight bitterly against each 
other. 


336 


If the Jews were the only people in the world, they would be wallowing 
in filth and mire and would exploit one another and try to exterminate one 
another in a bitter struggle, except in so far as their utter lack of the ideal of 
sacrifice, which shows itself in their cowardly spirit, would prevent this 
struggle from developing. 


It would, therefore, be a complete mistake to interpret the mutual help, 
which the Jews render one another when they have to fight or, to put it more 
accurately, to exploit their fellow-beings, as the expression of a certain 
idealistic spirit of sacrifice. 


Here again, the Jew merely follows the call of his individual egotism. 
That is why the Jewish State, which ought to be a vital organisation to serve 
the purpose of preserving or increasing the race, has absolutely no territorial 
boundaries, for the territorial delimitation of a State always demands a certain 
idealism of spirit on the part of the race which forms that State, and especially 
a proper acceptance of the idea of work. 


A State which 1s territorially delimited cannot be established or 
maintained, unless the general attitude towards work is a positive one. If this 
attitude 1s lacking, then the necessary basis of a civilisation is also lacking. 
That is why the Jewish people, despite the intellectual powers with which they 
are apparently endowed, have not a culture, certainly not a culture of their 
own. 


The culture which the Jew enjoys to-day is the product of the work of 
others and this product is debased in the hands of the Jew. 


In order to form a correct judgment of the place which the Jew holds in 
relation to the whole problem of human civilisation, we must bear in mind the 
essential fact that there never has been any Jewish art, and consequently that 
nothing of this kind exists to-day. 


We must realise that, especially in the two royal domains of art, namely, 
architecture and music, the Jew has done no original creative work. 


When the Jew comes to producing something in the field of art he merely 
‘borrows’ from something already in existence, or simply steals the intellectual 
work of others. 


The Jew essentially lacks the qualities which are characteristic of those 
creative races that are the founders of civilisation. 


337 


To what extent the Jew appropriates the civilisation built up by others— 
or to speak more accurately, corrupts it,—is indicated by the fact that he 
cultivates chiefly the art which calls for the smallest amount of original 
invention, namely the dramatic arts, and even here, he 1s nothing better than a 
kind of juggler or, perhaps more correctly, a kind of monkey imitator, for in this 
domain also he lacks the creative élan which is necessary for the production of 
all really great work. 


Even here, therefore, he is not a creative genius, but rather a superficial 
imitator who, in spite of all his retouching and tricks, cannot disguise the fact 
that there is no inner vitality in the shape he gives his products. 


At this juncture, the Jewish press comes in and renders friendly 
assistance by shouting hosannas over the head of even the most ordinary 
bungler of a Jew, until the rest of the world is persuaded into thinking that the 
object of so much praise must really be an artist, whereas in reality, he may be 
nothing more than a low-class mimic. 


The Jews have not the creative ability which is necessary for the 
founding of a civilisation, for in them there 1s not, and never hits been, that 
spirit of idealism which is an absolutely necessary element in the higher 
development of mankind. 


Therefore, the Jewish intellect will never be constructive, but always 
destructive. At best, it may serve as a stimulus in rare cases, but only 1n the 
limited meaning of the poet’s lines, “The Power which always wills the bad, 
and always works the good” (Die stets Bose will und stets das Gute schafft.). 


It is not through him, but in spite of him, that mankind makes progress. 


Since the Jew has never had a State which was based on territorial 
delimitations, and therefore never a civilisation of his own, the idea arose that 
here we were dealing with a people who had to be considered as nomads. 


That is a great and mischievous mistake. The true nomad does actually 
possess a definite delimited territory where he lives. It is merely that he does 
not cultivate it, as the settled farmer does, but that he lives on the products of 
his herds with which he wanders over his domain. 


The natural reason for this mode of existence is to be found in the fact 
that the soil is not fertile and that it does not give the steady produce which 
makes a fixed abode possible. 


338 


Outside of this natural cause, however, there is a more profound cause, 
namely, that no mechanical civilisation is at hand to make up for the natural 
poverty of the region in question. 


There are territories where the Aryan can establish fixed settlements by 
means of the technical skill which he has developed in the course of more than 
a thousand years, even though these territories would otherwise have to be 
abandoned, unless the Aryan were willing to wander about them in nomadic 
fashion, but age-long tradition of settled residence have made the nomadic life 
unbearable for him. 


We ought to remember that during the first period of American 
colonisation, numerous Aryans earned their daily livelihood as trappers, 
hunters, etc., frequently wandering about in large groups with their women and 
children, their mode of existence very much resembling that of ordinary 
nomads. 


The moment, however, that they grew more numerous and were able to 
accumulate larger resources, they cleared the land and drove out the 
aborigines, at the same time establishing settlements which rapidly increased 
all over the country. 


The Aryan himself was probably at first, a nomad and became a settler 
in the course of the ages, but yet he was never of the Jewish kind. 


The Jew is not a nomad, for the nomad has already a definite attitude 
towards the concept of ‘work,’ and this attitude served as the basis of a later 
cultural development when the necessary intellectual conditions existed. 


There is a certain amount of idealism in the general attitude of the 
nomad, even though it is rather primitive. His whole character may, therefore, 
be foreign to Aryan feeling, but it will never be repulsive. 


Not even the slightest trace of idealism exists, however, in the Jewish 
character. The Jew has never been a nomad, but always a parasite, battening on 
the substance of others. 


If he occasionally abandoned regions where he had hitherto lived, he did 
not do it voluntarily. He did it because, from time to time, he was driven out by 
people who were tired of having their hospitality, abused by such guests. 


Jewish self-expansion is a parasitic phenomenon, since the Jew is 


339 


always looking for ‘pastures new’ for his race. But this has nothing to do with 
nomadic life as such, because the Jew does not ever think of leaving a territory 
which he has once occupied. He sticks where he is with such tenacity that he 
can hardly be driven out even by superior physical force. 


He expands into new territories only when certain conditions for his 
existence are provided therein; but even then—unlike the nomad—he will not 
change his former abode. He is, and remains, a parasite, a sponger who, like a 
pernicious bacillus, spreads over wider and wider areas according as some 
favourable area attracts him. 


The effect produced by his presence is also like that of the vampire, for 
wherever he establishes himself the people who grant him hospitality are 
bound to be bled to death sooner or later. 


Thus the Jew has at all times lived in States that have belonged to other 
rags, and within the organisation of those States, he has formed a State of his 
own, which is, however, hidden behind the mask of a ‘religious community,’ as 
long as external circumstances do not make it advisable for this community to 
declare its true nature. 


As soon as the Jew feels himself sufficiently established in his position 
to be able to hold it without a disguise, he lifts the mask and suddenly appears 
in the character which so many did not formerly believe or wish to see, 
namely, that of the Jew. 


The life which the Jew lives as a parasite thriving on the substance of 
other nations and States has resulted in developing that specific character 
which Schopenhauer once described when he spoke of the Jew as ‘the great 
master of lies.’ 


The kind of existence which he leads, forces the Jew to the systematic 
use of falsehood, just as naturally as the inhabitants of northern climates are 
forced to wear warm clothes. 


He can live among other nations and States only as long as he succeeds 
in persuading them that the Jews are not a distinct people, but the 
representatives of a religious faith who thus constitute a ‘religious community,’ 
though this is of a peculiar character. 


As a matter of fact, however, this is the first of his great falsehoods. He 
is obliged to conceal his own particular character and mode of life, in order 


340 


that he may be allowed to continue his existence as a parasite among the 
nations. 


The greater the intelligence of the individual Jew, the better will he 
succeed in deceiving others. His success in this line may even go so far that the 
people who grant him hospitality are led to believe that the Jew among them is 
a genuine Frenchman, for instance, or Englishman or German or Italian, who 
just happens to belong to a religious denomination which is different from that 
prevailing in these countries. 


Especially in circles concerned with the executive administration of the 
State, where the officials generally have only a minimum of historical sense, 
the Jew is able to impose his infamous deception with comparative ease. In 
these circles, independent thinking is considered a sin against the sacred rules 
according to which official promotion takes place. 


It is, therefore, not surprising that even to-day in the Bavarian 
government offices, for example, there is not the slightest suspicion that the 
Jews form a distinct nation in themselves and are not merely the adherents of a 
‘confession,’ though one glance at the press which belongs to the Jews ought to 
furnish sufficient evidence to the contrary even for those who possess only the 
smallest degree of intelligence. 


The Jewish Echo, however, is not an official gazette and therefore not 
authoritative in the eyes of these government potentates. 


The Jews have always been a people of a definite racial character and 
never merely the adherents of a religion. 


At a very early date, urged on by the desire to make their way in the 
world, they began to cast about for a means whereby they might distract such 
attention as might prove inconvenient for them. 


What could be more effective, and at the same time above suspicion, 
than to borrow and utilise the idea of the religious community? 


Here also everything is copied, or rather stolen, for the Jew could not 
possess any religious institution which had developed out of his own 
consciousness, seeing that he lacks every kind of idealism, which means that 
belief ina life beyond this terrestrial existence is foreign to him. 


In the Aryan mind no religion can ever be imagined unless 1t embodies 


341 


the conviction that life in some form of other will continue after death. 


As a matter of fact, the Talmud is not a book that lays down principles 
according to which the individual should prepare for the life to come. It only 
furnishes rules for a practical and convenient life in this world. 


The religious teaching of the Jews is principally a collection of 
instructions for maintaining the Jewish blood pure and for regulating 
intercourse between Jew and Jew and between Jews and the rest of the world, 
that is to say non-Jews. 


The Jewish religious teaching is not concerned with moral problems. It 
is concerned rather with economic problems, and very petty ones at that. 


In regard to the moral value of the religious teaching of the Jews there 
exist, and always have existed, exhaustive studies (not from the Jewish side, 
for whatever the Jews have written on this question has naturally always been 
of a tendentious character), which show up the kind of religion that the Jews 
have ina light which makes it look very uncanny to the Aryan mind. 


The Jew himself is the best example of the kind of product which this 
religious training evolves. His life is of this world only and his mentality is as 
foreign to the true spirit of Christianity, as his character was foreign to the 
great Founder of the new creed two thousand years ago. 


The Founder of Christianity made no secret of His estimation of the 
Jewish people; when He found it necessary, He drove those enemies of the 
human race out of the Temple of God, because then, as always, they used 
religion as a means of advancing their commercial interests. 


At that time Christ was nailed to the Cross for his attitude towards the 
Jews, whereas our modern Christians enter into party politics, and when 
elections are being held they debase themselves to beg for Jewish votes. 


They even enter into political intrigues with the atheistic Jewish parties 
against the interests of their own Christian nation. 


On this first and fundamental lie, the purpose of which is to make people 
believe that Jewry is not a people, but a religion, other lies are subsequently 
based. 


One of these further lies concerns, for example, the language spoken by 


342 


the Jew. For him language is not an instrument for the expression of his inner 
thoughts, but rather a means of cloaking them. 


When talking French his thoughts are Jewish, and when writing German 
rhymes he only gives expression to the character of his own race. 


As long as the Jew has not succeeded in mastering other peoples, he is 
forced to speak their language whether he likes it or not, but the moment that 
the world became the slave of the Jew, it would have to learn some universal 
language (Esperanto, for example), so that by this means the Jew could 
dominate it the more easily. 


How much the whole existence of this people is based on a permanent 
falsehood is proved in a unique way by ‘The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,’ 
which are so violently repudiated by the Jews. 


With groans and moans, the Frankfurter Zeitung repeats again and again 
that these are forgeries. This alone is evidence in favour of their authenticity. 


What many Jews unconsciously wish to do is here clearly set forth. It is 
not necessary to ask out of what Jewish brain these revelations sprang, but 
what is of vital interest is that they disclose, with an almost terrifying 
precision, the mentality and methods of action characteristic of the Jewish 
people and these writings expound, in all their various aspects, the final aims 
towards which the Jews are striving. 


The study of real happenings, however, 1s the best way of judging the 
authenticity of these documents. If the historical developments, which have 
taken place within the last century, be studied in the light of this book, we shall 
understand why the Jewish press incessantly repudiates and denounces it, for 
the Jewish peril will be stamped out the moment the general public comes into 
possession of that book and understands it. 


In order to get to know the Jew properly, it is necessary to study the road 
which he has been following among the other peoples during the last few 
centuries. 


One example will suffice to make this clear. Since his career has been 
the same throughout the ages—yust as the people at whose expense he has 
lives, have remained the same—1it will be best for the purpose of making the 
requisite analysis, to mark his progress by stages. For the sake of simplicity, 
we Shall indicate these stages by letters of the alphabet. 


343 


The first Jews came into what was then called Germanic during the 
period of the Roman invasion, and, as usual, they came as merchants. 


During the turmoil caused by the great migrations of the German tribes 
the Jews seem to have disappeared. We may, therefore, consider the period 
when the Germans formed the first political communities as the beginning of 
that process whereby Central and Northern Europe were again, and this time 
permanently, Judaised. 


A development then began which has always been the same or similar, 
wherever and whenever Jews came into contact with Aryan peoples. 


(a) As soon as the first permanent settlements had been established, the 
Jew was suddenly ‘there.’ He arrived as a merchant and, in the beginning, did 
not trouble to disguise his nationality. 


He still remained openly a Jew, partly it may be, because his appearance 
betrayed the racial difference between him and the people of the country in 
which he dwelt, or because he knew too little of the language. 


It may also be that people of other races refused to mix with him, so that 
he could not very well adopt any other pose than that of a foreign merchant. 
Because of his subtlety and cunning and the lack of experience on the part of 
the people whose guest he became, it was not to his disadvantage openly to 
retain his Jewish character. 


This may even have been advantageous to him, for the foreigner was 
received kindly. 


(b) Slowly but steadily, he began to take part in the economic life around 
him, not as a producer, however, but only as a middleman. 


His commercial cunning, acquired through thousands of years of 
negotiation as an intermediary, made him superior in this field to the Aryans, 
who were still quite ingenuous and indeed clumsy, and whose honesty was 
unlimited, so that after a short time commerce seemed destined to become, a 
Jewish monopoly. 


The Jew began by lending out money and, as usual, at a usurious rate of 
interest. It was he who first introduced the payment of interest on borrowed 
money. 


344 


The danger which this innovation involved was not at first recognised; 
indeed, the innovation was welcomed, because it offered momentary 
advantages. 


(c) At this stage the Jew had become firmly settled; that is to say, he 
inhabited special sections of the cities and towns and had his own quarter in 
the market-towns. Thus he gradually came to forma State within the State. 


He came to look upon the commercial domain and all monetary 
transactions, as a privilege belonging exclusively to himself, and exploited it 
ruthlessly. 


(d) At this stage finance and trade had become his complete monopoly. 
Finally, his usurious rate of interest aroused opposition, and the increasing 
impudence which the Jew began to manifest all round stirred up popular 
indignation, while his display of wealth gave rise to popular envy. 


The cup of his iniquity became full to the brim, when he included landed 
property among his commercial wares and degraded the land to the level ofa 
market commodity. 


Since he himself never cultivated the soil, but considered it as an object 
to be exploited, allowing the peasant to remain on the land, but only on 
condition that he submitted to the most heartless exactions of his new master, 
public antipathy against the Jew steadily increased and finally turned into open 
animosity. 


His extortionate tyranny became so unbearable that people rebelled 
against his control and used physical violence against him. They began to 
scrutinise this foreigner somewhat more closely and then began to discover the 
repulsive traits aid characteristics inherent in him, until finally the gulf 
between the Jews and their hosts could no longer be bridged. 


In times of distress a wave of public anger has usually arisen against the 
Jew; the masses have taken the law into their own hands; they have seized 
Jewish property and ruined the Jew in their urge to protect themselves against 
what they consider to be a scourge of God. 


Having come to know the Jew intimately in the course of centuries, they 
looked upon his presence among them as a public danger comparable only to 
the plague. 


345 


(ce) Then the Jew began to reveal his true character. He paid court to 
governments, with servile flattery, used his money to ingratiate himself further 
and thus regularly secured for himself once again the privilege of exploiting his 
victims. 

Although public wrath flared up against this eternal profiteer and drove 
him out, after a few years he reappeared in those same place, and carried on as 
before. 


No persecution could force him to give up his trade of exploiting other 
people and no amount of harrying succeeded in driving him out permanently. 
He always returned after a short time and it was always the old story with him. 
In an effort to prevent at least the worst from happening, laws were passed 
which debarred the Jew from obtaining possession of land. 


(f) In proportion as the powers of kings and princes increased, the Jew 
sidled up to them. He begged for ‘charters’ and ‘privileges’ which those 
gentlemen, who were generally in financial straits, gladly granted if they 
received adequate payment in return. 


However high the price he has to pay, the Jew will succeed in getting it 
back within a few years with interest and even with compound interest thanks 
to the privilege he has acquired. He is a real leech who clings to the body of 
his unfortunate victims and cannot be removed, so that when the princes found 
themselves in need once again they took the blood from his swollen veins with 
their own hands. 


This game was repeated unendingly. In the case of those who were 
called the ‘German princes,’ the part they played was quite as contemptible as 
that played by the Jew. They were a real scourge to their people. 


Their compeers may be found in some of the government ministers of our 
time. It was due to the German princes that the German nation could not 
succeed in definitely freeing itself from the Jewish peril. 


Unfortunately, the situation did not change at a later period. The princes 
finally received the reward which they had a thousand-fold deserved for all the 
crimes committed by them against their own people. They had allied 
themselves with Satan and later on they discovered that they were in Satan’s 
power. 


(g) By permitting themselves to be entangled in the toils of the Jew, the 


346 


princes prepared their own downfall. The position which they held among 
their people was slowly but steadily undermined, not only by their continued 
failure to guard the interests of their subjects, but by their positive exploitation 
of them. 


The Jew calculated exactly the time when the downfall of the princes 
was approaching and did his best to hasten it. He intensified their financial 
difficulties by hindering them in the exercise of their duty towards their people, 
by encouraging them, through the most servile flattery, to indulge in vicious 
habits, whereby he made himself more and more indispensable to them. 


His astuteness, or rather, his utter unscrupulousness in money affairs 
enabled him to exact fresh payments from the princes subjects, to squeeze the 
money out of them and then have it spent as quickly as possible. 


Every Court had its ‘Court Jew,’ as this plague was called, who tortured 
the innocent victims until they were driven to despair, while at the same time 
he provided the means which the princes squandered on their own pleasures. 


It is not to be wondered at that these ornaments of the human race 
became the recipients of official honours and were even admitted to the ranks 
of the hereditary nobility, thus contributing not only to expose that social 
institution to ridicule, but also to contaminate it from the inside. 


Naturally, the Jew could now exploit the position which he had attained 
and advance even more rapidly than before. 


Finally, he only needed to be baptised in order to become entitled to all 
the rights and privileges which belonged to the children of the nation on which 
he preyed. 


This was an excellent stroke of business for him, and he often availed 
himself of it, to the great joy of the Church, which was proud of having gained 
a new child in the Faith, and also to the joy of Israel, which was happy at 
seeing the trick pulled off successfully. 


(h) At this stage a transformation began to take place in the world of 
Jewry. Up to now they had been Jews, that is to say, they had not hitherto set 
any great value on pretending to be something else, and anyhow, the distinctive 
characteristics which separated them from other races could not be easily 
overcome. 


347 


Even as late as the time of Frederick the Great nobody looked upon the 
Jews as other than a ‘foreign’ people, and Goethe rose up in revolt against the 
failure legally to prohibit marriage between Christians and Jews. 


Goethe was certainly no reactionary and no timeserver; through him 
there spoke the voice of the blood and the voice of reason. 


Notwithstanding the disgraceful happenings taking place in Court circles, 
the people recognised instinctively that the Jew was the foreign body in their 
own flesh and their attitude towards him was dictated by recognition of that 
fact. 


But a change was now destined to take place. In the course of more than 
a thousand years the Jew had learned to master the language of his hosts so 
thoroughly that he considered he might now lay less stress on his Jewish 
character and emphasise his ‘Germanism’ more. 


Though it must have appeared ridiculous and absurd at first sight, he was 
impudent enough to call himself a ‘Teuton,’ which in this case, meant a 
German. 


In that way began one of the most infamous impositions that can be 
imagined. The Jew did not possess the slightest traces of the German character. 


He had only acquired the art of twisting the German language to his own 
uses, and that in a disgusting way, without having assimilated any other feature 
of the German character. Therefore, his command of the language was the sole 
ground on which he could pretend to be a German. 


It is not, however, by the tie of language, but exclusively by the tie of 
blood that the members of a race are bound together, and the Jew himself 
knows this better than any other, seeing that he attaches so little importance to 
the preservation of his own language while at the same time he strives his 
utmost to keep his blood free from intermixture with that of other races. 


A man may acquire and use a new language without much trouble, but it 
is only his old ideas that he expresses through the new language; his inner 
nature is not modified thereby. The best proof of this is furnished by the Jew 
himself. He may speak a thousand tongues and yet his Jewish nature will 
always remain one and the same. 


His distinguishing characteristics were the same when, as a grain- 


348 


merchant, he spoke the Latin language at Ostia two thousand years ago, as they 
are to-day when he tries to sell adulterated flour with the aid of his German 
gibberish. He is always the same Jew. 


That so simple a fact is not recognised by the average head-clerk ina 
German government department, or by an officer in the police force, is also 
self-evident and obvious, since it would be difficult to find another class of 
people who are so lacking in instinct and intelligence as the civil servants 
employed by our modern German state authorities. 


The reason why, at the stage I am dealing with, the Jew so suddenly 
decided to transform himself into a German is not difficult to discover. 


He felt the power of the princes slowly crumbling and therefore looked 
about to find a new social plank on which he might stand. 


Furthermore, his financial domination in all the spheres of economic life 
had become so great that he felt he could no longer sustain that enormous 
structure, or extend his influence, unless he were admitted to the full enjoyment 
of the ‘rights of citizenship.’ 


He aimed at both, preservation and expansion; for the higher he could 
climb, the more alluring became the prospect of reaching the old goal, which 
was promised to him in ancient times, namely world domination to which he 
now looked forward with feverish eyes, as he thought he saw it within his 


grasp. 


Therefore, all his efforts were now directed to becoming a fully-fledged 
citizen, endowed with all civil and political rights. That was the reason for his 
emancipation from the ghetto. 


(1) Thus the Court Jew slowly developed into the democratic Jew, but 
naturally, he still remained associated with persons in higher quarters, and he 
even attempted to push his way further into the inner circles of the ruling set. 


At the same time some other representatives of his race were currying 
favour with the people. 


If we remember the crimes the Jew had committed against the masses of 
the people in the course of so many centuries, how repeatedly and ruthlessly he 
had exploited them and how he had sucked the very marrow of their substance, 
and when we further remember how they gradually came to hate him and 


349 


finally considered him as public scourge then we can well understand how 
difficult the Jew must have found this final transformation; indeed, it must have 
taxed all his powers to be able to present himself as ‘the friend of humanity’ to 
the poor victims whom he had bled white. 


Therefore, the Jew began by making public amends for the crimes which 
he had committed against the people in the past. 


He started his metamorphosis by first appearing as the ‘benefactor’ of 
humanity. 


Since his new philanthropic policy had a very concrete aim in view, he 
could not very well apply to himself the biblical counsel, not to allow his left 
hand to know what his right hand was doing. 


He felt obliged to let as many people as possible know how deeply the 
sufferings of the masses grieved him and to what excesses of personal sacrifice 
he was ready to-go in order to help them. 


With this manifestation of innate modesty, so typical of the Jew, he 
trumpeted his virtues to the world until finally the world actually began to 
believe him. Those who refused to share this belief were considered to be 
doing him an injustice. 


Thus, after a little while he began to twist things round, so as to make it 
appear that it was he who had always been wronged, and not vice versa. There 
were actually some particularly foolish people who could not help pitying this 
poor unfortunate creature of a Jew. 


Attention may be called to the fact that, in spite of his proclaimed 
readiness to make personal sacrifices, the Jew never becomes poor thereby. 
He has a happy knack of always making both ends meet. 


Occasionally, his benevolence might be compared to the manure which 
is not spread over the field merely out of kindness, but rather with a view to 
future produce. 


Anyhow, after a comparatively short period of time, the world was given 
to know that the Jew had become a general benefactor and philanthropist. What 
a unique transformation! 


What is looked upon as more or less natural when done by other people, 


350 


here became an object of astonishment, and even sometimes of admiration, 
because it was considered so unusual in a Jew. 


That is why he has received more credit for his acts of benevolence than 
ordinary mortals. And something more! The Jew became liberal all ofa 
sudden and began to talk enthusiastically of how human progress must be 
encouraged. 


Gradually he assumed the air of being the herald of a new age. Yet, at the 
same time, he continued to undermine the groundwork of that economic system 
which is of most benefit to the people. 


He bought up stock in the various national undertakings and thus pushed 
his influence into the circle of national production, making this latter an object 
of buying and selling on the Stock Exchange, or rather what might be called a 
pawn in a financial game of chess, thus ruining the only basis on which 
personal proprietorship is possible. 


Only with the entrance of the Jew did that feeling of estrangement 
between employers and employees begin which led at a later date to the 
political class-struggle. 


Finally, the Jew gained an increasing influence in all economic 
undertakings by means of his predominance on the Stock Exchange. He 
secured, if not the ownership, at least the control of the working capacity of the 
nation. 


In order to strengthen his political position, he directed his efforts 
towards removing the barrier of racial and civic discrimination which had 
hitherto hindered his advance at every turn. 


With characteristic tenacity he championed the cause of religious 
tolerance for this purpose, and in the Freemason organisation, which had fallen 
completely into his hands, he found a magnificent weapon which helped him to 
achieve his ends. 


Government circles, as well as the higher sections of the political and 
commercial bourgeoisie, fell prey to his plans through his manipulation of the 
masonic net, though they themselves did not even suspect what was happening. 


Only the people as such, or rather the masses which were just becoming 
conscious of their own power and were beginning to use it in the fight for their 


351 


rights and liberties, had hitherto escaped the grip of the Jew. 


At least, his influence had not yet penetrated to the deeper and wider 
sections of the people, This was unsatisfactory to him. 


The most important phase of his policy was therefore to secure control 
over the people. 


The Jew realised that in his efforts to reach the position of public despot 
he would need a ‘pacemaker,’ and he thought he could find a pace-maker if he 
could whip-in sufficiently large sections of the bourgeoisie, but the 
Freemasons failed to catch the glove-manufacturers and the linen-weavers in 
the frail meshes of their net, and so it became necessary to find a grosser and 
withal a more effective means. 


Thus another weapon beside that of freemasonry had to be secured. This 
was the press. The Jew exercised all his skill and tenacity in getting hold of it. 


By means of the press he began gradually to control public life in its 
entirety. He began to drive it along the road which he had chosen for the 
purpose of reaching his own ends, for he was now ina position to create and 
direct that force which, under the name of “public opinion’ is better known to- 
day than it was some decades ago. 


Simultaneously, the Jew gave himself the air of thirsting after knowledge. 
He lauded every phase of progress, particularly those phases which led to the 
ruin of others, for he judges all progress and development from the standpoint 
of the advantages which these bring to his own people. When it brings him no 
such advantages, he is the deadly enemy of enlightenment and hates all culture 
which is real culture as such. All the knowledge which he acquires in the 
schools of others is exploited by him exclusively in the service of his own 
race. 


He now guarded his Jewish ‘nationality’ more jealously than ever 
before. Though bubbling over with talk of ‘enlightenment,’ ‘progress,’ ‘liberty,’ 
‘humanity,’ etc., his first care was to preserve the racial integrity of his own 
people. 


He occasionally bestowed one of his female offspring on an influential 
Christian, but the racial stock of his male descendants was always preserved 
unmixed on principle. He poisoned the blood of others, but preserved his own 
blood unadulterated. 


352 


The Jew scarcely ever married a Christian girl, but the Christian took a 
Jewess to wife. The mongrels that were the issue of this latter union always 
took after the Jewish side. Thus a part of the higher nobility in particular 
became completely degenerate. 


The Jew was well aware of this fact and systematically used this means 
of disarming the intellectual leaders of the opposite race. 


To mask his tactics and fool his victims, he talked of the equality of all 
men, no matter what their race or colour, and the simpletons began to believe 
him. 


Since his whole nature still retained too much that was alien for the 
broad masses of the people to allow themselves to be caught in his snare, he 
used the press to put before the public a picture of himself which was entirely 
untrue to life, but well designed to serve his purpose. 


In the comic papers special efforts were made to represent the Jews as 
an inoffensive little race which, like all others, had its peculiarities. 


The comic papers presented the Jews as fundamentally goodhearted and 
honourable in spite of their manners, which might seem a bit strange. An 
attempt was generally made to make them appear insignificant, rather than 
dangerous. 


During this phase of his progress the chief goal of the Jew was the 
victory of democracy, or rather the supreme hegemony of the parliamentary 
system, which embodied his concept of democracy. 


This institution harmonised best with his purpose, for thus the personal 
element was eliminated and in its place we had the dunder-headed majority, 
inefficiency and, last but by no means least, cowardice. 


The final result must necessarily have been the overthrow of the 
monarchy, which had to come sooner or later. 


(j) A tremendous economic development transformed the social structure 
of the nation. As the small handicrafts gradually disappeared, the manual 
worker was robbed of the chance of earning his bread independently, and sank 
to the level of the proletariat. 


In his stead came the factory worker, whose essential characteristic is 


353 


that he is seldom in a position to support himself independently in later life. In 
the true sense of the word, he is ‘disinherited.’ His old age is a misery to hint 
and can hardly be called a life at all. 


In earlier times ,a similar situation had been created, which had 
imperatively demanded a solution and for which a solution was found. 


Side by side with the peasant and the artisan, a new class had gradually 
developed, namely, that of officials and employees, especially those employed 
in the various’ services of the State. 


They also were a ‘disinherited’ class, in the true sense of the word, but 
the State found a remedy for this unhealthy situation by taking upon itself the 
duty of providing for the State official who was not in a position to make 
provision for his old age. 


Thus the system of pensions and retiring allowances was introduced. 
Private enterprises slowly followed this example in increasing numbers, so 
that to-day every permanent non-manual worker receives a pension in his later 
years, if the firm which he has ,served is one that has reached or exceeded a 
certain limit of size. 


It was only by virtue of the assurance given to State officials, that they 
would be cared for in their old age, that such a high degree of unselfish 
devotion to duty was developed, which in pre-war times was one of the 
distinguishing characteristics of German officials. 


Thus a whole class which had no personal property was saved from 
destitution by an intelligent system of provision, and found a place in the social 
structure of the national community. 


The problem has once again arisen for the State and the nation, but this 
time it is more comprehensive. When the new industries sprang up and 
developed, millions of people left the countryside and the villages to take up 
employment in the big factories. 


The conditions under which this new class found itself forced to live 
were worse than miserable. The more or less mechanical transformation of the 
methods of work hitherto in vogue among the artisans and peasants did not fit 
in well with the habits or mentality of this new working-class. 


The way in which the peasants and artisans had formerly worked had 


354 


nothing comparable to the intensive labour of the new factory-worker. 


In the old trades, time did not play a highly important role, but it became 
an essential element in the new industrial system. 


The formal taking over of the old working hours by the mammoth 
industrial enterprises had fatal results. The actual amount of work hitherto 
accomplished within a certain time was comparatively small, because the 
modern methods of intensive production were then unknown. Therefore, 
although under the older system a working day of fourteen or even fifteen hours 
was not unendurable, now it was beyond the limits of human endurance, 
because under the new system every minute was utilised to the extreme. 


This absurd transference of the old working hours to the new industrial 
system proved fatal in two directions. 


Firstly, 1t ruined the health of the workers; secondly, it destroyed their 
faith in a superior law of justice. 


Finally, on the one hand, a miserable wage was received and, on the 
other, the employer held a much more lucrative position than before. 


In the open country there could be no social problem, because the master 
and the farm-hand were doing the same kind of work and doing it together. 
They ate their food in common, and sometimes even out of the same dish. 


But this, too, was altered. The division created between employer and 
employee seems now to have extended to all branches of life. 


How far this Judaising process has been allowed to take effect among 
our people is illustrated by the fact that manual labour not only receives 
practically no recognition, but is even considered degrading. 


That is not a natural German attitude. It is due to the introduction of a 
foreign element into our lives, and that foreign element is the Jewish spirit, one 
of the effects of which has been to transform the high esteem in which our 
handicrafts were once held into a certain contempt for all manual labour. 


Thus a new social class has grown up which stands in low esteem, and 
the day must come when we shall have to face the question of whether the 
nation will be able to make this class an integral part of the social community, 
or whether the difference of status now existing will become a permanent gulf 


355 


separating this class from the others. 


One thing, however, is certain, namely, that this class does not include 
the worst elements of the community in its ranks, on the contrary, it includes the 
most energetic elements of the nation. 


The sophistication which is the result of a so-called civilisation has not 
yet exercised its disintegrating and degenerating influence on this class. The 
broad masses of this new lower class, consisting of the manual labourers, have 
not yet fallen prey to the morbid weakness of pacifism. They are still robust 
and, if necessary, they can be brutal. 


While our bourgeois middle class paid no attention at all to this 
momentous problem and indifferently allowed events to take their course, the 
Jew realised the manifold possibilities which the situation offered him for the 
future. 


While, on the one hand, he organised capitalistic methods of exploitation 
to the highest possible degree, he curried favour with the victims of his policy 
and his power and ina short while became the leader of their struggle against 
himself. 


‘Against himself? is here only a figurative way of speaking; for this 
‘great master of lies’ knows how to appear in the guise of the innocent and 
throw the guilt on others. 


Since he had the impudence to take a personal lead among the masses, 
they never for a moment suspected that they were falling a prey to one of the 
most infamous deceptions ever practised. 


Yet that is what it actually was. The moment this new class had arisen 
out of the general economic situation and taken shape as, a definite body in the 
social order, the Jew clearly saw where he would find the necessary pace- 
maker for his own progressive march. 


At first he had used the bourgeois class as a battering-ram against the 
feudal order, and now he used the worker against the bourgeois world. 


Just as he succeeded in obtaining civic rights by intrigues carried on 
under the protection of the bourgeois class, he now hoped that by joining in the 
struggle which the workers were waging for their own existence, he would be 
able to obtain the mastery he desired. 


356 


When that moment arrives, the only objective the workers will have to 
fight for will be the future of the Jewish people. 


Without knowing it, the worker is placing himself at the service of the 
very power against which he believes he is fighting. Apparently he is being 
made to fight against capital and thus he is all the more easily brought to fight 
for capitalistic interests. 


Outcries are systematically raised against international capital, but in 
reality it is against the national economic structure that these slogans are 
directed. The idea is to demolish this structure and on its ruins triumphantly 
erect the structure of the International Stock Exchange. 


The method of procedure of the Jew was as follows: He kowtowed to 
the worker, hypocritically pretended to feel pity for him and his lot, and even 
to be indignant at the misery and poverty which he had to endure. 


That is the way in which the Jew endeavoured to gain the confidence of 
the working class. He showed himself eager to study their various hardships, 
whether real or imaginary, and strove to awaken a yearning on the part of the 
workers to change the conditions under which they lived. 


The Jew artfully enkindled that innate yearning for social justice which 
is a typical Aryan characteristic. Once that yearning became alive, it was 
transformed into hatred against those in more fortunate circumstances of life. 


The next stage was to give a precise ideological aspect to the struggle 
for the elimination of social wrongs, and thus the Marxist doctrine was 
invented. By presenting this doctrine as part and parcel of a just vindication of 
social rights, the Jew propagated it all the more effectively, but at the same 
time he provoked the opposition of decent people who refused to admit these 
demands which, because of the form and pseudo-philosophical trimmings in 
which they were presented, seemed fundamentally unjust and unrealisable, for, 
under the cloak of purely social concepts there were hidden aims which were 
of a Satanic character. 


These aims are even openly expounded wish the clarity of unlimited 
impudence. This Marxist doctrine 1s an indivisible mixture of human reason 
and human absurdity, but the combination is arranged in such a way that only 
the absurd part of it could ever be put into practice, never the reasonable part. 


By categorically repudiating the personal worth of the individual and 


357 


also of the nation and its racial constitution, this doctrine destroys the 
fundamental basis of all civilisation, for civilisation depends essentially on 
these very factors. 


Such is the true essence of the Marxist Weltanschauung, in so far as the 
word Weltanschauung can be applied at all to these phantoms arising froma 
criminal brain. 


The destruction of the concept of personality and of race removes the 
chief obstacle which barred the way to domination of the social body by its 
inferior elements, which are the Jews. 


The very absurdity of the economic and political theories of Marxism 
gives the doctrine its peculiar significance. 


Because of, its pseudo-logic, intelligent people refuse to support it, 
while all those who are less accustomed to use their intellectual faculties, or 
who have only a rudimentary notion of economic principles, join the Marxist 
cause wholeheartedly. 


The intelligence behind the movement—for even this movement needs 
intelligence if it is to subsist—is supplied by the Jews themselves, as a 
‘sacrifice’ on their part. 


Thus arose a movement which was composed exclusively of manual 
workers under the leadership of Jews. To all external appearances, this 
movement strives to ameliorate the conditions under which the workers live, 
but in reality its aimis to enslave and thereby annihilate the non-Jewish 
peoples. 


The propaganda which the Freemasons had carried on among the so- 
called intelligentsia, whereby their pacifist teaching paralysed the instinct for 
national self-preservation, was now extended to the broad masses of the 
workers and the bourgeoisie by means of the press, which was almost 
everywhere in Jewish hands. 


To those two instruments of disintegration, a third and still more ruthless 
one was added, namely, the organisation of brute force. Massed columns of 
Marxist attackers were intended to complete the work of attrition which the 
two weapons formerly employed had brought to the verge of fulfilment. 


The combined activity of all these forces has been marvellously 


358 


managed, and it will not be surprising if it turns out that those institutions 
which have always appeared as the organs of the more or less traditional 
authority of the State should now fall before the Marxist attack. 


With very few exceptions, the Jew has found the most complacent 
promoters of his work of destruction among the higher, and even the highest, 
government officials. 


An attitude of sneaking servility towards ‘superiors’ and supercilious 
arrogance towards ‘inferiors’ are the characteristics of this class of people, as 
well as an appalling stupidity which is exceeded only by its amazing self- 
conceit. 


These qualities are of the greatest utility to the Jew in his dealings with 
our authorities and consequently he appreciates them. 


If I were to sketch roughly the actual struggle which is now beginning I 
should describe it somewhat thus: 


Not satisfied with the economic conquest of the world, but demanding 
that it must also come under his political control, the Jew subdivides the 
organised Marxist power into two parts, which correspond to the ultimate 
objectives that are to be fought for in this struggle which is carried on under 
his direction. 


To outward appearance, these seem to be two independent movements, 
but in reality they constitute an indivisible unity. 


The two divisions are the political movement and the trade-union 
movement. 


The trade-union movement has to gather in the recruits. It offers 
assistance and protection to the workers in the hard struggle which they have to 
wage for the bare means of existence, a struggle which has been occasioned by 
the greediness and narrow-mindedness of many of the industrialists. 


Unless the workers are ready to surrender all claims to an existence 
which the mere dignity of human nature itself demands, and unless they are 
ready to submit their fate to the will of employers who, in many cases, have no, 
sense of human responsibility and are utterly callous to human wants, then the 
worker must necessarily take matters into his own hands, seeing that the 
organised social community—that is to say, the State—pays no attention to his 


359 


needs. 


The so-called national-minded bourgeoisie, blinded by its own material 
interests, opposes this life-and-death struggle of the workers and places the 
most difficult obstacles in their way. 


Not only does this bourgeoisie hinder all efforts to bring in legislation 
which would shorten the inhumanly long hours of work, prohibit child-labour, 
grant security and protection to women and improve the hygienic conditions in 
the workshops and the dwellings of the working class, but while it is engaged 
in so doing, the shrewd Jew takes the cause of the oppressed into his own 
hands. 


He gradually becomes the leader of the trade-union movement, which is 
an easy task for him, because he does not genuinely intend to find remedies for 
the social wrong; he pursues only one objective, namely, to gather and 
consolidate a body of followers who will act under his command as an armed 
weapon in the economic war for the destruction of national economic 
independence. 


For, while a sound social policy has to aim at a double objective, that of 
securing a decent standard of public health and welfare on the one hand, and 
that of safeguarding the independence of the economic life of the nation, on the 
other, the Jew does not take these two aims into account at all. 


The destruction of both is one of his main objects. He would ruin, rather 
than safeguard, the independence of the national economic system. 


Therefore, as the leader of the trade-union movement, he has no scruples 
about putting forward demands which not only go beyond the declared purpose 
of the movement, but could not be carried into effect without ruining the 
national economic structure. 


On the other hand, he has no interest in seeing a healthy and sturdy 
population develop; he would be more content to see the people degenerate 
into an unthinking herd which could be reduced to total subjection. 


Because these are his final objectives, he can afford to put forward the 
most absurd claims. 


He knows very well that these claims can never be realised and that, 
therefore, nothing in the actual state of affairs can be altered by them, but that 


360 


the most they can do is to arouse the spirit of unrest among the masses. 


That is exactly the purpose which he wishes such propaganda to serve 
and not a real and honest improvement of the social status of the worker. 


The Jews will, therefore, remain the unquestioned leaders of the trade- 
union movement as long as no far-reaching campaign 1s undertaken for the 
enlightenment of the masses, in order that they may be better enabled to 
understand the causes of their misery. 


The same end might be achieved if the government authorities were to 
get rid of the Jew and his work, for as long as the masses remain as ill- 
informed as they actually are to-day, and as long as the State remains as 
indifferent to their lot as it now is, the masses will follow whatever leaders 
make them the most extravagant promises in regard to economic matters. 


The Jew is a past-master in this art and his activities are not hampered 
by moral considerations of any kind. Naturally, it takes him only a short time to 
defeat all his competitors in this field and drive them from the scene of action. 
In accordance with the general brutality and rapacity of his nature, he turns the 
trade-union movement into an organisation for the exercise of physical 
violence. The resistance and antipathy of those whose insight has hitherto 
saved them from swallowing the Jewish bait, have been broken down by 
terrorism. 


The success of that kind of activity is enormous. Actually, the Jew is 
using the trade-union, which could be a blessing to the nation, as a weapon 
with which to destroy the foundations of the national economic structure. 


Side by side with this, the political organisation advances. It operates 
hand-in-hand with the trade-union movement, inasmuch as the latter prepares 
the masses for the political organisation and even forces them into it. 


This is also the source that provides the money which the political 
organisation needs to keep its enormous apparatus in action. 


The trade-union organisation is the organ of control for the political 
activity of its members and whips in the masses for all great political 
demonstrations. 


In the end, it ceases to struggle for economic interests, but places its 
chief weapon, refusal to continue work (which takes the form of a general 


361 


strike) at the disposal of the political movement. 


In a press, the reading matter of which is adapted to the level of the most 
ignorant readers, the political and trade-union organisations are provided with 
an instrument which prepares the lowest stratum of the nation for a campaign of 
ruthless destruction. 


It is not considered part of the purpose of this press to inspire its readers 
with ideals which might help them to lift their minds above the sordid 
conditions of their daily lives, but, on the contrary, it panders to their lowest 
instincts. 


Among the lazy-minded and self-seeking sections of the masses this kind 
of speculation turns out lucrative. 


It is this press, above all, which carries on a fanatical campaign of 
calumny, strives to tear down everything that might be considered mainstay of 
national independence, cultural standing and economic self-sufficiency. 


It aims its attacks especially against all men of character who refuse to 
fall into line with the Jewish efforts to obtain control over the State, or who 
appear dangerous to the Jews merely because of their superior intelligence. 


In order to incur the enmity of the Jew it is not necessary to show any 
open hostility towards him; it is sufficient if a man is considered capable of 
opposing the Jew at some time in the future, or of using his abilities and 
character to enhance the power and position of a nation which the Jew 
considers hostile to himself. 


The Jew’s instinct, which never fails where these problems have to be 
dealt with, readily discerns the true mentality of those whom he meets in 
everyday life and those who are not of a kindred spirit may be sure of being 
listed among his enemies. 


Since the Jew is not the object of aggression, but himself the aggressor, 
he considers as his enemies not only those who attack him, but also those who 
may be capable of resisting him. 


The means which he employs to break people of this kind who show 
themselves decent and upright, 1s no honourable conflict, but falsehood and 
calumny. He will stop at nothing. His utterly lowdown conduct is so appalling 
that one really cannot be surprised if, in the imagination of our people, Satan, 


362 


as the incarnation of all evil, assumes the form and features of the Jew. 


The ignorance of the broad masses as regards the inner character of the 
Jew, and the lack of instinct and insight displayed by our upper classes, are 
among the reasons which explain how it is that so many people fall an easy 
prey to the systematic campaign of falsehood which the Jew carries on. 


While the upper classes, with their innate cowardliness, turn away from 
anyone whom the Jew thus attacks with lies and calumny, the common people 
are credulous of everything, whether because of their ignorance or their 
simple-mindedness. 


Government authorities wrap themselves ina cloak of silence, but more 
frequently they persecute the victims of Jewish attacks in order to stop the 
campaign in the Jewish press. 


To the fatuous mind of the government official, such a line of conduct 
appears to be in line with the policy of upholding the authority of the State and 
preserving public order. 


Gradually, the Marxist weapon in the hands of the Jew becomes a 
constant bogey to decent people and weighs upon them like a kind of 
nightmare. People begin to quail before this fearful foe and thereby become his 
victims. 

(k) The domination of the Jew in the State seems now so fully assured 
that not only can he afford to call himself a Jew once again, but he even 
acknowledges freely and openly his ideas on racial and political questions. 


A section of the Jews avows itself quite openly as an alien people, but 
even here there is another falsehood. 


When the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the new 
national consciousness of the Jews will be satisfied by the establishment of a 
Jewish State in Palestine, the Jews thereby adopt another means to dupe the 
simple-minded Aryan. 


They have not the slightest intention of building up a Jewish State in 
Palestine so as to live init. What they are really aiming at is to establisha 
central organisation for their international swindling and cheating. 


AS a sovereign State, this cannot, be controlled by any of the other 


363 


States. Therefore, it can serve as a refuge for swindlers who have been found 
out, and at the same time, a high school for the training of other swindlers. As a 
sign of their growing confidence and sense of security, a certain section of 
them openly and impudently proclaims its Jewish nationality, while another 
section hypocritically pretend to be German, French or English, as the case 
may be. 


Their blatant behaviour in their relations with other people shows how 
clearly they envisage their day of triumph in the near future. 


The black-haired Jewish youth lies in wait for hours on end, Satanically 
glaring at and spying on the unsuspecting girl whom he plans to seduce, 
adulterating her blood and removing her from the bosom of her own people. 


The Jew uses every possible means to undermine the racial foundations 
of a people to be subjugated. 


In his systematic efforts to ruin girls and women, he strives to break 
down the last barriers of racial discrimination. 


The Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, 
with the ultimate idea of bastardizing the white race which they hate, and thus 
lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate. 


As long as a people remains racially pure and race-conscious, it can 
never be overcome by the Jew. Never in this world can the Jew become master 
of any people except a bastardised people. 


That is why the Jew systematically endeavours to lower the racial 
quality of a people by permanently adulterating the blood of the individuals 
who make up that people. 


In the field of politics he now begins to replace the idea of democracy by 
that of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 


In the masses organised under the Marxist banners he has found a 
weapon which makes it possible for him to discard democracy, so as to 
subjugate and rule the nations in a dictatorial fashion by the aid of brute force. 


He works systematically in order to bring about this revolution by two 
methods, the economic and the political. 


Aided by international influences, he forms a ring of enemies around 


364 


those nations which have proved themselves too sturdy for him, in 
withstanding attacks from within. 


He tries to force them into war and then, if it should be necessary to his 
plans, he will unfurl the banners of revolt even while the troops are actually 
fighting at the front. 


Economically, he brings about the destruction of the State by a systematic 
method of sabotaging social enterprises until these become so costly that they 
are taken out of the hands of the State and submitted to the control of Jewish 
finance. 


Politically, he works to withdraw from the State its means of 
subsistence, inasmuch as he undermines the foundations of national resistance 
and defence, destroys the confidence which the people have in their 
government, reviles the past and its history and drags everything really great 
into the gutter. 


Culturally, his activity consists in poisoning art, literature and the 
theatre, holding the expression of natural sentiment up to scorn, overturning all 
concepts of the sublime and beautiful, the worthy and the good, finally dragging 
the people down to the level of his own low mentality. 


Of religion he makes a mockery. Morality and decency are described as 
antiquated prejudices and thus a systematic attack is made for the purpose of 
undermining those last foundations on which the national being must rest if the 
nation is to struggle for its existence in this world. 


(1) Now begins the great and final revolution. As soon as the Jew is in 
possession of political power he drops all pretence. Out of the democratic 
Jew, the Jew of the people, arises the Jew lusting for blood, the tyrant of the 
peoples. 


In the course of a few years he endeavours to exterminate all those who 
represent the national intelligentsia, and by thus depriving the peoples of their 
natural intellectual leaders, he orepares them for their fate as slaves under a 
lasting despotism. Russia furnishes the most terrible example of such slavery. 


In that country the Jew killed or starved thirty millions of the people ina 
bout of savage fanaticism and resorted to the employment of inhuman torture. 
He did this so that a gang of Jewish would-be literati and financial bandits 
should dominate over a great people. 


365 


The final consequence is not merely that the people lose all their 
freedom under the domination of the Jews, but that in the end, these parasites 
themselves disappear. The death of the victim is followed sooner or later by 
that of the vampire. 


If we review all the causes which contributed to bring about the 
downfall of the German people we shall find that the most profound acid 
decisive cause lies in lack of insight into the racial problem and especially in 
failure to recognise the Jewish menace. It would have been easy enough to 
endure the defeats suffered on the battlefields in August 1918. They were 
nothing as compares with the military victories which our nation had achieved. 


Our downfall was not the result of those defeats; we were overthrown by 
that force which had prepared those defeats by systematically operating for 
several decades to destroy those political instincts and that moral stamina 
which alone enable a people to struggle for its existence and thereby secure the 
right to exist. 


By neglecting the problem of preserving the racial foundations of our 
national life, the old Reich abrogated the sole right which entitles a people to 
live on this planet. 


Nations that make mongrels of their people or allow their people to be 
turned into mongrels, sin against the Will of Eternal Providence, and thus their 
overthrow at the hands of a stronger opponent cannot be looked upon as a 
wrong but, on the contrary, as a restoration of justice. 


If a people refuses to guard and uphold the qualities with which it has 
been endowed by Nature and which have their roots in the racial blood, then 
such a people has no right to complain over the loss of its earthly existence. 


Everything on this earth can be changed for the better. 
Every defeat may be made the foundation of a future victory. 
Every lost war may be the cause of a later resurgence. 


Every form of distress can give, a new impetus to human energy, and 
from oppression those forces can develop which bring about a re-birth of the 
national soul—provided always that the racial blood is kept pure. 


The loss of racial purity will wreck inner happiness for ever. 


366 


It degrades men for all time to come, and the physical and moral 
consequences can never be wiped out. 


If this unique problem be studied and compared with the other problems 
of life we shall easily recognise how small is their importance in comparison 
with this. 


They are all limited in time, but the problem of the maintenance or loss 
of the purity of the racial blood will last as long as man himself exists. 


All the symptoms of decline which manifested themselves in pre-war 
times can be traced back to the racial problem. 


Whether one is dealing with questions of general law, of monstrous 
wrongs in economic life, of phenomena which point to a cultural decline or 
political degeneration whether it be a question of defects in the school-system 
or of the evil influence which the press exerts over the adult population in 
every case there phenomena are caused by a lack of consideration for the 
interests of the race to which one’s own nation belongs, or by failure to 
recognise the danger that comes from allowing a foreign race to exist within 
the national body. 


That is why all attempts at reform, all institutions for social relief, all 
political striving, all economic progress and all apparent increase in the 
general stock of knowledge, were doomed to be unproductive of any 
significant results. 


The nation, as well as the organisation which enables it to exist, namely, 
the State, were not developing in inner strength and stability but were, on the 
contrary, visibly losing their vitality. 


The false brilliance of the Second Reich could not disguise its inner 
weakness, and every attempt to invigorate it anew failed, because the main and 
most important problem was left out of consideration. It would be a mistake to 
think that the followers of the various political parties which tried to doctor the 
condition of the German people, or even all their leaders, were bad in 
themselves or meant wrong. Their activity was doomed to fail, merely 
because, at best, they saw nothing but the symptoms of our general malady and 
they tried to doctor the symptoms while they overlooked the real cause of the 
disease. 


If one makes a methodical study of the lines along which the old Reich 


367 


developed, one cannot help seeing, after a careful political analysis, that a 
process of inner degeneration had already set in, even at the time when the 
united Reich was established and the German nation was enjoying prosperity. 


The general situation was declining, in spite of apparent political 
success and in spite of increasing economic wealth. At the Reichstag elections 
the growing number of Marxist votes indicated that the internal breakdown and 
the political collapse were rapidly approaching. 


All the victories of the so-called bourgeois parties were fruitless, not 
only because they could not prevent the numerical increase is the growing mass 
of Marxist votes, even when the bourgeois parties triumphed at the polls, but 
mainly because they themselves were already infected with the germs of decay. 
Though quite unaware of, it, the bourgeois world was infected from within 
with the deadly virus of Marxist ideas. The fact that they sometimes openly 
resisted was to be attributed to rivalry between ambitious political leaders, 
rather than to any opposition on principle between adversaries who were 
determined to fight one another to the bitter end. 


During all those years only one protagonist was fighting with steadfast 
perseverance. This was the Jew. The Star of David steadily ascended, as the 
will to national self-preservation declined. 


Therefore, it was not a nation filled with the determination to attack, 
which rushed to the battlefields in August 1914, but it was rather the 
manifestation of the last flickering instinct of national self-preservation in the 
face of the progress of the paralysis with which the pacifist and Marxist 
doctrine threatened our people. Even in those days when the fate of the nation 
hung in the balance, the internal enemy was not recognised and therefore all 
efforts to resist the external enemy were bound to be in vain. 


Providence did not grant the reward to the victorious sword, but 
followed the eternal law of retributive justice. A profound recognition of all 
this was the source of those principles and tendencies which inspire our new 
Movement. We were convinced that only by recognising such truths could we 
stop the national decline in Germany and lay a granite foundation on which the 
State could again be built up, a State which would not be a piece of mechanism 
alien to our people, constituted for economic needs and interests, but an 
organism created from the soul of the people themselves. 


A GERMANIC STATE OF THE GERMAN NATION.

CHAPTER XII: THE FIRST STAGE IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST 
GERMAN LABOUR PARTY 


Here at the close of this volume I shall describe the first stage in the 
progress of our Movement and shall give a brief account of the problems we 
had to deal with during that period. 


In doing this I have no intention of expounding the ideals which we have 
setup as the goal of our Movement, for these ideals are so momentous in their 
significance that an exposition of them will need a whole volume. 


Therefore, I shall devote the second volume of this book to a detailed 
survey of the principles which form the programme of our Movement and I 
shall attempt to draw a picture of what we mean by the word ‘State.’ 


When I say ‘we’, in this connection, I mean to include all those hundreds 
of thousands who have fundamentally the same longing, though in the 
individual cases they cannot find adequate words to describe the vision that 
hovers before their eyes. 


It is a characteristic feature of all great reforms that, in the beginning, 
there is only one single protagonist to come forward on behalf of several 
million people. 


The final goal of a great reformation has often been the object of 
profound longing on the part of hundreds of thousands for centuries past, until 
finally one among them comes forward as a herald to announce the will of that 
multitude and become the champion of the old desire, which he now sets about 
triumphantly realising in the form of a new ideal. 


The fact that millions of our people yearn for a radical change in our 
present conditions is proved by the profound discontent which exists among 
them. 


This feeling is manifested in a thousand ways. Some express it in their 
discouragement and despair; others show it in resentment, anger and 
indignation. 


In some this profound discontent calls forth an attitude of indifference, 


371 


while it urges others to violent manifestations of wrath. 


Another indication of this feeling may be seen, on the one hand, in the 
attitude of those who abstain from voting at elections and, on the other, in the 
large numbers of those who side with the fanatical extremists of the left wing. 


It was to the latter that our young Movement had to appeal first of all. It 
was not to be an organisation for contented and satisfied people, but was meant 
to gather in all those who were suffering from profound anxiety and could find 
no peace, those who were unhappy and discontented. It was not meant to float 
on the surface of national life, but rather to push its roots deep down among the 
people. 


Looked at from the purely political point of view, the situation in 1918 
was as follows: A nation had been torn asunder. One part, which was by far 
the smaller of the two, comprised the intellectual classes of the nation, from 
which all those employed in physical labour were excluded. 


On the surface, these intellectual classes appeared to be national- 
minded, but that word meant nothing to them except a very vague and feeble 
concept of the duty to defend what they called the interests of the State, which 
in turn seemed identical with those of the dynastic regime. 


This class tried to defend its ideas and realise its aims by carrying on the 
fight with the aid of intellectual weapons, which, insufficient and superficial 
enough in the face of the brutal methods adopted by the adversary, were, of 
their very nature, bound to fail. 


With one violent blow the class which had hitherto governed was now 
struck down; it trembled with fear and accepted every humiliation imposed on 
it by the merciless victor. 


Over against this class stood the broad masses of manual labourers who 
were organised in movements with a more or less radically Marxist tendency. 
These organised masses were firmly determined to break any kind of 
intellectual resistance by the use of brute force. 


They had no nationalist tendencies whatsoever and deliberately 
repudiated the idea of advancing the interests of the nation as such. 


On the contrary, they promoted the interests of the foreign oppression. 
Numerically, this class embraced the majority of the population and, what is 


372 


more important, included all those elements of the nation without whose 
collaboration a national resurgence was not only a practical impossibility, but 
was even inconceivable. 


Even in 1918 one thing had to be clearly recognised, namely, that no 
resurgence of the German nation could take place until we had first re- 
established our national strength in relation to the outside world. 


For this purpose arms were not the preliminary necessity, though our 
bourgeois ‘statesmen’ always blathered about it being so; what was wanted 
was will-power. 


At one time the German people had more than sufficient armaments, and 
yet that did not suffice for the defence of its liberty, because it lacked that 
energy which springs from the instinct of national self-preservation and the 
will to hold one’s own. 


The best armament is only dead and worthless material as long as the 
spirit is wanting which makes men willing and determined to avail themselves 
of such weapons. Germany was rendered defenceless, not because she lacked 
arms, but because she lacked the will to keep her arms for the further 
preservation of her people. 


To-day our left-wing politicians, in particular, are constantly insisting 
that their craven-hearted and obsequious, but in reality treacherous, foreign 
policy necessarily results from the disarmament of Germany. 


To all that kind of talk the answer ought to be, ‘No, the contrary is the 
truth. Your action in delivering up the arms was dictated by your anti-national 
and criminal policy of abandoning the interests of the nation. Now you try to 
make people believe that your miserable whining is fundamentally due to the 
fact that you have no arms. Just like everything else in your conduct, this is a 
lie and a falsification of the true facts.’ 


The politicians of the right deserve exactly the same reproach. It was 
through their miserable cowardice that those ruffians of Jews who came into 
power in 1918 were able to rob the nation of its arms. 


The conservative politicians have neither right nor reason on their side 
when they cite disarmament as the cause which compelled them to adopt a 
policy of prudence (that is to say, of cowardice). 


373 


The truth is that disarmament is the result of their pusillanimity. 


Therefore, the problem of restoring Germany’s power is not a question 
of how we can manufacture arms, but rather a question of how we can foster 
that spirit which enables a people to bear arms. 


Once this spirit prevails among a people, then it will find a thousand 
ways, each of which leads to the acquisition of arms. A coward will not fire 
even a single shot when attacked, though he may be armed with ten pistols; to 
him they are of less value than a blackthorn in the hands of a man of courage. 


The problem of re-establishing the political power of our nation 1s first 
of all a problem of restoring the instinct of national self-preservation, if for no 
other reason than that every preparatory step in foreign policy and every 
weighing up by foreign Powers of the military value of a State has been proved 
by experience to be grounded not on the total amount of armaments such a State 
may possess, but rather on the moral capacity for resistance which such a State 
has, or is believed to have. 


The question whether or not a nation be desirable as an ally is 
determined not so much by the inert mass of arms which it has at hand, but by 
the obvious presence of an enthusiastic will to national self-preservation and a 
heroic courage which will fight to the last breath, for an alliance is not made 
between arms but between men. 


The British nation will, therefore, be considered as the most valuable 
ally in the world as long as it can be counted upon to show that brutality and 
tenacity in its government, as well as in the spirit of the broad masses, which 
enables it to carry on till victory any struggle upon which it once enters, no 
matter how long such a struggle pray last, no matter how great the sacrifice that 
may be necessary and no matter what the means that have to be employed—and 
all this even though the actual military equipment at hand may be utterly 
inadequate as compared with that of other nations. 


Once it is understood that the restoration of Germany is a question of 
reawakening the will to political self-preservation we shall see quite clearly 
that 1t will not be enough to win over those elements that are already national- 
minded, but that the deliberately anti-national masses must be converted to 
believe in the national ideals. 


A young movement that aims at re-establishing a German State with full 


374 


sovereign powers will therefore have to make the task of winning over the 
broad masses a special objective of its plan of campaign. 


Our so-called ‘national bourgeoisie’ are so lamentably supine, generally 
speaking, and their national spirit appears so feckless, that we may feel sure 
they will offer no serious resistance against a vigorous national foreign or 
domestic policy. 


Even though the narrow-minded German bourgeoisie should keep up a 
passive resistance when the hour of deliverance is at hand, as they did in 
Bismarck’s time, we shall never have to fear any active resistance on their 
part, because of their acknowledged and proverbial cowardice. 


It is quite different with the masses of our population, who are imbued 
with ideas of internationalism. Through the primitive roughness of their 
natures, they are disposed to accept the idea of violence, while at the same 
time their Jewish leaders are more brutal and ruthless. 


They will crush any attempt at a German revival, just as they smashed 
the German Army by striking at it from the rear. 


Above all, these organised masses will use their numerical majority in 
this parliamentarian State, not only to hinder any national foreign policy, but 
also to prevent Germany from restoring her prestige abroad and so establishing 
her desirability as an ally. 


For it is not we ourselves alone who are aware of the handicap that 
results from the existence of fifteen million Marxists, democrats, pacifists and 
followers of the Centre in our midst; foreign nations also recognise this 
internal burden which we have to bear and take it into their calculations when 
estimating the value of a possible alliance with us. 


Nobody would wish to form an alliance with a State where the active 
portion of the population is at least passively opposed to any resolute foreign 
policy. 


The situation is made still worse by reason of the fact that the leaders of 
those parties which were responsible for the betrayal of the nation are ready to 
oppose any and every attempt at a revival, simply because they want to retain 
the positions they now hold. 


According to the laws that govern human history, it is inconceivable that 


375 


the German people could resume the place they formerly held without 
retaliating on those who were both cause and occasion of the collapse that 
involved the ruin of our State. 


Before the judgment seat of posterity November 1918 will not be 
regarded as a simple rebellion but as high treason against the country. 


Therefore, it is not possible to think of re-establishing German 
sovereignty and political independence without at the same time reconstructing 
a united front within the nation. 


Looked at from the standpoint of practical ways and means, it seems 
absurd to think of liberating Germany from foreign bondage as long as the 
masses of the people are not willing to support such an ideal of freedom. 


Considering this problem from the purely military point of view, 
everybody, and in particular every officer, will agree that a war cannot be 
waged against an outside enemy by battalions of students; but that, together 
with the brains of the nation, the physical strength of the nation is also 
necessary. 


Furthermore, it must be remembered that the nation would be robbed of 
irreplaceable assets, if the national defence were composed only of the 
intellectual circles, as they are called. 


The young German intellectuals who joined the volunteer regiments and 
fell on the, battlefields of Flanders in the autumn of 1914 were bitterly missed 
later on. 


They were the most valuable treasure which the nation possessed and 
their loss could not be made good in the course of the war. 


It is not only the struggle itself which could not be waged if the working 
classes of the nation did not join the storm battalions, but the necessary 
technical preparations could not be made without a united will and a common 
front within the nation itself: 


Our nation which has to exist disarmed under tie thousand eyes 
appointed by the Versailles Peace Treaty, cannot make any technical 
preparations for the recovery of its freedom and human independence, until the 
whole army of spies employed within the country is cut down to those few 
whose inborn baseness would lead them to betray anything and everything for 


376 


the proverbial thirty pieces of silver. 


We can deal with such people, but the millions, who are opposed to the 
national revival, simply because of their political opinions, constitute an 
insurmountable obstacle. 


At least, the obstacle will remain insurmountable, as long as the cause of 
their opposition, which is international Marxism, is not overcome and its 
teachings banished from both their hearts and minds. 


From whatever point of view we may examine the possibility of 
recovering our independence as a State and as a nation, whether we consider 
the problem from the standpoint of technical rearmament or from that of the 
actual struggle itself, the necessary prerequisite always remains the same. 


This prerequisite is that the broad masses of the people must first be won 
over to accept the principle of our national independence. 


If we do not regain our external freedom, every step forward in domestic 
reform will be at best an augmentation of our productive powers for the benefit 
of those nations that look upon us as a colony to be exploited. 


The surplus produced by any so-called economic revival would only go 
into the hands of our international supervisors, and any social betterment 
would at best increase our output, to the advantage of those persons. 


No cultural progress can be made by the German nation, because such 
progress is too much bound up with the political independence and dignity of a 
people. 


Since, therefore, we can find a satisfactory solution for the problem of 
Germany’s future only by winning over the broad masses of our people for the 
support of the national idea, this must be considered the highest and most 
important task to be accomplished by a movement which does not strive 
merely to satisfy the needs of the moment, but considers itself bound to 
examine in the light of future results everything it decides to do or to refrain 
from doing. 


As early as 1919 we were convinced that to make the masses national- 
minded would have to constitute the first and paramount aim of the new 
movement. From the tactical standpoint, this decision brought with it a certain 
number of obligations. 


17 


(1) No social sacrifice could be considered too great in this effort to win 
over the masses for the national revival. 


Whatever economic concessions are granted to-day to employees are 
negligible when compared with the benefit to be reaped by the whole nation if 
such concessions contribute to bring back the masses of the people once more 
to an appreciation of their own nationality. 


Nothing but meanness and short-sightedness, which are characteristics 
that are unfortunately only too prevalent among our employers, could prevent 
people from recognising that in the long run no economic improvement and 
therefore no rise, in profits are possible unless the internal volkisch solidarity 
of our nation be restored. 


If the German trade-unions had defended the interests of the working- 
classes uncompromisingly during the War; 


- if, even during the War, they had used the weapon of the strike to force 
the industrialists (who were greedy for higher dividends) to grant the demands 
of the workers for whom the unions acted; 


- if at the same time they had stood up as good Germans for the defence 
of the nation as stoutly as for their own claims; and 


- if they had given as unstintedly to their country that which was their 
country’s due—then the War would never have been lost. 


How ludicrously insignificant would all, and even the greatest, economic 
concessions have been as compared with the tremendous importance of such a 
victory! 


For a movement which would restore the German worker to the German 
people it is, therefore, absolutely necessary to understand clearly that 
economic sacrifices must be considered negligible in such cases, provided, of 
course, that they do not go the length of endangering the independence and 
stability of the national economic system. 


(2) The education of the masses along national lines can be carried out 
only indirectly, by improving social conditions, for only by sucha process can 
the economic conditions be created which enable everybody to share in the 
cultural life of the nation. 


378 


(3) The making of the broad masses national-minded can never be 
achieved by half-measures—that is to say, by feebly insisting on what is called 
the objective side of the question—but only by a ruthless and fanatically one- 
sided insistence on the aim which must be achieved. 


This means that a people cannot be made ‘national’ in the sense of that 
word as accepted by our bourgeois class to-day—that 1s to say, nationalism 
with many reservations—but ‘national’ in the vehement and extreme sense. 


Poison can be overcome only by a counter-poison and only the supine 
bourgeois mind could think that the Kingdom of Heaven can be attained by a 
compromise. 


The broad masses of a nation are not made up of professors and 
diplomats. Since these masses have but little acquaintance with abstract ideas, 
their reactions lie more in the domain of the feelings, which determine their 
positive or their negative attitude as the case may be. 


They are susceptible only to a manifestation of strength which comes 
definitely either from the positive or the negative side, but they are never 
susceptible to any half-hearted attitude that wavers between one pole and the 
other. 


The emotional grounds of their attitude furnish the reason for their 
extraordinary stability. It is always more difficult to fight successfully against 
faith than against knowledge. 


Love is less subject to change than respect. Hatred is more lasting than 
mere aversion. None of the tremendous revolutions which this world has 
witnessed, have been brought about by a scientific revelation, which has 
moved the masses, but always by an ardour which has inspired them, and often 
by a kind of hysteria which has urged them to action. 


Whoever wishes to win over the masses must find the key that will open 
the door to their hearts. It is not objectivity, which is weakness, but 
determination and strength. 


(4) The soul of the masses can be won only if those who lead the 
movement are determined not merely to carry through the positive struggle for 
their own aims, but are also determined to destroy the enemy that opposes 
them. 


379 


When they see an uncompromising onslaught against an adversary, the 
people have at all times taken this as a proof that right is on the side of the 
aggressor. 


But if the aggressor should go only half-way and fail to push home his 
success by driving his opponent entirely from the scene of action, the people 
will look upon this as a sign that the aggressor is uncertain of the justice of his 
own cause and, that his half-way policy may even be an acknowledgment that 
his cause is unjust. 


The masses are but a part of Nature herself. Their feeling is such that 
they cannot understand mutual handshakings between men who are declared 
enemies. 


Their wish is to see the stronger side win and the weaker wiped out, or 
subjected unconditionally to the will of the stronger. 


It is possible to succeed in making the masses national-minded, only if, 
positive though the struggle to win the soul of the people may be, those who 
spread the international poison among them are exterminated. 


(5) All the great problems of our time are problems of the moment and 
are only the results of certain definite causes, and among all these there is only 
one that has a profoundly causal significance. 


This is the problem of preserving the pure racial stock among the people. 
Human vigour or decline depends on the blood. 


Nations that are not aware of the importance of their racial stock, or 
which neglect to preserve it, are like men who would try to educate the pug- 
dog to do the work of the greyhound, not understanding that neither the speed of 
the greyhound nor the imitative faculties of the poodle are inborn qualities 
which cannot be drilled into the one or the other by any form of training. 


A people that fails to preserve the purity of its racial blood thereby 
destroys the unity of the soul of the nation in all its manifestations. 


A disintegrated national character is the inevitable consequence of a 
process of disintegration in the blood, and the change which takes place in the 
spiritual and creative faculties of a people is only an outcome of the change 
that has modified its racial substance. If we are to free the German people from 
all those non-characteristic failings and traits we must first get rid of alien 


380 


causes of these traits and failings. The German nation will never revive unless 
the racial problem, and with it, the Jewish question, is taken into account and 
dealt with. 


The racial problem furnishes the key, not only to the understanding of 
human history, but also to the understanding of every kind of human culture. 


(6) By incorporating in the national community the broad masses of our 
people (who are now in the international camp) we do not mean to renounce 
the principle that the interests of the various trades and professions must be 
safeguarded. 


Divergent interests in the various branches of labour and in the trades 
and professions are not the same as a division between the various classes, but 
rather a natural feature inherent in our economic life. 


Vocational grouping does not clash in the least with the idea of a national 
community, for it means national unity in regard to all those problems that 
affect the life of the nation as such. 


To incorporate in the national community, or in the State, a stratum of the 
people which has now formed a social class, the standing of the upper classes 
must not be lowered, but that of the lower classes must be raised. 


The class which carries through this process is never the upper class, but 
rather the lower one which is fighting for equality of rights. 


The bourgeoisie of to-day was not incorporated in the State through 
measures enacted by the feudal nobility, but only through its own energy and 
leaders who had sprung from its own ranks. 


The German worker cannot be raised from his present status and 
incorporated in the German folk-community by means of goody-goody 
meetings where people talk about the brotherhood of the people, but rather by a 
systematic improvement in the social and cultural life of the worker, until the 
yawning gulf between him and the other classes can be bridged. 


A movement which has this for its aim must try to recruit its followers 
mainly from the ranks of the working class. It must include members of the 
intellectual classes only in so far as such members have rightly understood, 
and accepted without reserve, the ideal towards which the movement is 
striving. This process of transformation and reunion cannot be completed 


381 


within ten or twenty years; it will take several generations, as the history of 
such movements has shown. 


The most difficult obstacle to the inclusion of our contemporary worker 
in the national folk-community does not consist so much in the fact that he 
fights for the interests of his fellow-workers, but rather in the influence of his 
international leaders and their anti-national and non-patriotic attitude which he 
has accepted. 


If they were inspired by the principle of devotion to the nation in all that 
concerns its political and social welfare, the trade-unions would make those 
millions of workers most valuable members of the national community, 
irrespective of their own individual struggle on behalf of economic interests. 


A movement which sincerely endeavours to bring the German worker 
back into his folk community, and rescue him from the folly of internationalism, 
must wage a vigorous campaign against certain notions that are prevalent 
among the industrialists. 


One of these notions is that according to the concept of the folk- 
community, the employee is obliged to surrender all his economic rights to the 
employer and, further, that the workers would come into conflict with the folk- 
community, if they should attempt to defend their own justified and vital 
interests. 


Those who try to propagate such a notion are deliberate liars. The folk- 
community imposes obligations not only on the one side, but also on the other. 


A worker certainly does something which is contrary to the spirit of the 
folk-community, if he acts entirely on his own initiative and puts forward 
exaggerated demands, without taking the common weal or the maintenance of 
the national economic structure into consideration. 


But an industrialist also acts against the spirit of the folk-community, if 
he adopts inhumane methods of exploitation and misuses the working capacity 
of the nation and, by sweating the workers, amasses million for himself. 


He has no right to call himself ‘national’ and no right to talk of a folk- 
community, for he is only an unscrupulous egotist who sows the seeds of social 
discontent and provokes future conflicts which are bound to prove injurious to 
the interests of the country. 


382 


The reservoir from which the young movement has to draw its members 
will be first of all the working classes. These classes must be delivered from 
the clutches of the international mania. 


Their social distress must be eliminated. They must be raised above 
their present cultural level, which is deplorable and transformed into a 
resolute and valuable factor in the folk-community, inspired by national ideas 
and national sentiment. 


If, among those intellectual circles that are nationalist in their outlook, 
men can be found who genuinely love their people and look forward eagerly to 
the future of Germany, and at the same time have a sound grasp of the 
importance of a struggle, whose aim is to win over the soul of the masses, such 
men will be cordially welcomed in the ranks of the movement. 


They can serve as a valuable intellectual support in the work that is to be 
done. But this movement can never aim at recruiting its membership from the 
unthinking herd of bourgeois voters. If it did so, the movement would be 
burdened with a mass of people whose whole mentality would only help to 
paralyse the efforts of the campaign to win over the broad masses. 


In theory it may be very fine to say that the broad masses ought to be 
influenced by a combined leadership of the upper and lower social strata 
within the framework of the one movement; but notwithstanding all this, the 
fact remains that, though it may be possible to exercise a psychological 
influence on the bourgeois classes and to arouse some enthusiasm or even 
awaken some understanding among them by public demonstrations, it is 
impossible to eliminate those characteristics, or rather faults, which have 
grown and developed in the course of centuries. 


The difference between the cultural levels of the two groups and 
between their respective attitudes towards economic questions is still so great 
that it would turn out a hindrance to the movement the moment the first 
enthusiasm aroused by demonstrations calmed down. 


Finally, it is not part of our programme to transform the nationalist camp 
itself, but, rather to win over those who are anti-national in their outlook. It is 
this point of view which must finally determine the tactics of the whole 
movement. 


(7) This one-sided, but, consequently, clear and definite attitude must be 


383 


manifested in the propaganda of the movement; and, on the other hand, this 
clarity is absolutely necessary in order to make the propaganda itself effective. 


If propaganda is to be of service to the movement it must be addressed to 
one side alone; for if it should vary the direction of its appeal it will not be 
understood in the one camp and may be rejected by the other as obvious and 
uninteresting, for the intellectual background of the two camps that come into 
question is very different. 


Even the manner in which something is presented and the tone in which 
particular details are emphasised cannot have the same effect on those two 
strata that belong respectively to the opposite extremes of the social structure. 


If the propaganda should refrain from using primitive forms of 
expression, it will not appeal to the sentiment of the masses. 


If, on the other hand, it conforms to the crude sentiments of the masses in 
its words and gestures, the intellectual circles will be averse to it because of 
its crudity and vulgarity. 


Among a hundred men who call themselves orators, there are scarcely 
ten who are capable of speaking with effect to an audience of street-sweepers, 
mechanics, navvies, etc., to-day and of expounding the same subject with equal 
effect to-morrow to an audience of university professors and students. 


Among a thousand public speakers there may be only one who can 
address a mixed audience of mechanics and professors in the same hall in such 
a way that his statements can be fully comprehended by each group while, at 
the same time, he effectively influences both to such an extent that they are 
carried away by a common enthusiasm. It must always be remembered that in 
most cases even the most beautiful idea embodied in a sublime theory can be 
brought home to the public only by men of middling ability. 


The thing that matters here 1s not the vision of the man of genius who 
created the great ideal, but rather what his apostles tell the broad masses, how 
they do this and with what degree of success. 


Social Democracy and the whole Marxist movement were particularly 
qualified to attract the great masses of the nation, because of the uniformity of 
the public to which they addressed their appeal. 


The more limited and narrow their ideas and arguments, the easier it was 


384 


for the masses to grasp and assimilate them, for those ideas and arguments 
were well adapted to a low level of intelligence. 


These considerations led the new movement to adopt the following clear 
and simple line of policy. In its message as well as in its forms of expression 
the propaganda had to be kept on a level with the intelligence of the masses, 
and its value had to be measured only by the actual success it achieved. 


At a public meeting where the great masses are gathered together the best 
speaker is not he whose way of approaching a subject is most akin to the spirit 
of those intellectuals who may happen to be present, but the speaker who 
knows how to win the hearts of the masses. 


An educated man who is present and who finds fault with an address 
because he considers it to be on an intellectual plane that is too low, though he 
himself has witnessed its effect on the lower intellectual groups whose 
adherence has to be won, only shows himself completely incapable of rightly 
judging the situation and thereby proves that he can be of no use in the new 
movement. 


Only those intellectuals can be of use to a movement who understand its 
mission and its aims so well that they have learned to judge the methods of 
propaganda exclusively by the success obtained and never by the impression 
which those methods, make on them personally. 


Propaganda is not meant to serve as an entertainment for those people 
who already have a nationalist outlook; its purpose is to win the adhesion of 
those who have hitherto been hostile to the nation, but who are, nevertheless, 
of our own blood and race. 


In general, those considerations of which I have given a brief summary in 
the chapter on ‘War Propaganda’ became the guiding rules and principles 
which determined the kind of propaganda we were to adopt in our campaign 
and the method by which we were to carry it out. 


The success that has been obtained proves that our decision was right. 


(8) The ends which any political reform movement sets out to attain can 
never be reached by trying to educate the public or influence those in power, 
but only by getting political power into its hands. 


It is not only the right, but the duty, of the protagonists of any world- 


385 


shattering ideal to secure control of such means as will enable them to realise 
that idea. 


In this world, success is the standard whereby we can decide whether 
such an undertaking was right or wrong, and by the word ‘success’ in this 
connection I do not mean such a success as the mere acquisition of power in 
1918, but the beneficial results of such an acquisition of power. 


A coup d’etat cannot, therefore, he considered successful if, as many 
empty-headed critics in Germany now, believe, the revolutionaries succeeded 
in seizing control of the State, but only 1f, in comparison with the state of 
affairs under the old regime, the lot of the nation has been improved when the 
aims and intentions on which the revolution was based have been put into 
practice. 


This certainly does not apply to the German Revolution, as the coup was 
called, which was effected by a gang of bandits in the autumn of 1918. 


But if the acquisition of political power be a requisite preliminary for 
the practical realisation of the ideals that inspire a reform movement, then any 
movement which aims at reform must, from the very first day of its activity, be 
considered by its leaders as a movement of the masses and not as a literary 
tea-club or an association of Philistines who meet to play ninepins. 


(9) The nature and internal organisation of the new movement make it 
anti-parliamentarian. 


That is to say, it rejects in general, and in its own structure, the principle 
according to which decisions are to be taken on the vote of the majority and 
according to which the leader is only the executor of the will and opinion of 
others. 


The movement lays down the principle that, in the smallest, as well as in 
the greatest, problems, one person must have absolute authority and bear all 
responsibility. 


In the movement the practical consequences of this principle are as 
follows: The president of a local group is appointed by the head of the group 
immediately above his in authority. He is then the responsible leader of his 


group. 


All the committees are subject to his authority and not he to theirs. There 


386 


is no such thing as committees that vote, but only committees that work. 


This work is allotted by the responsible leader, who is the president of 
the group. The same principle applies to the higher organisations—the Bezirk 
(district), the Kreis (urban circuit) and the Gau (the region). 


In each case the president is appointed from above and is invested with 
full authority and executive power. Only the leader of the whole party is 
elected, at the general meeting of the members, but he is the sole leader of the 
movement. 


All the committees are responsible to him, but he is not responsible to 
the committees. His decision is final, but he bears the whole responsibility for 
it. 

The members of the movement are entitled to call him to account by 


means of a new election, or to remove him from office, if he has violated the 
principles of the movement or has not served its interests adequately. 


He is then replaced by a more capable man, who is invested with the 
same authority and obliged to bear the same responsibility. 


One of the highest duties of the movement is to make this principle valid 
not only within its own ranks, but also for the whole State. 


The man who becomes leader is invested with supreme and unlimited 
authority, but he also has to bear the final and heaviest responsibility. 


The man who has not the courage to shoulder responsibility for his 
actions is not fitted to be a leader. Only a man of heroic mould can have the 
vocation for such a task. 


Human progress and human culture are not founded by the multitude. 
They are exclusively the work of personal genius and personal efficiency. 


To cultivate these and give them their due, is one of the conditions 
necessary for the regaining of the prestige and power of our nation. 


Because of this principle, the movement must necessarily be anti- 
parliamentarian: and if it takes part in a parliamentary institution 1t must be 
only for the purpose of destroying this institution from within; in other words, 
we wish to do away with an institution which we must look upon as one of the 
gravest symptoms of human decline. 


387 


(10) The movement steadfastly refuses to take up any stand in regard to 
problems which are either outside of its sphere of political work or seem to 
have no fundamental importance for it. 


It does not aim at bringing about a religious reformation, but rather a 
political re-organisation of our people. 


It looks upon the two religious denominations as equally valuable 
mainstays for the existence of our people, and therefore it makes war on all 
those parties which would degrade the foundation on which the religious and 
moral stability of our people is based, by exploiting it in the service of party 
interests. 


Finally, the movement does not aim at re-establishing any one form of 
State or trying to destroy another, but rather at making those fundamental 
principles prevail without which no republic and no monarchy can exist for 
any length of time. 


The movement does not consider its mission to be the establishment of a 
monarchy or the preservation of the Republic but rather the creation of a 
Germanic State. 


The problem of the external form of this State, that is to say, its final 
shape, is not of fundamental importance. It is a problem which must be solved 
in the light of what seems practical and opportune. Once a nation has 
understood and appreciated the great problems that affect its inner existence, 
the question of formalities will never lead to internal conflict. 


(11) The problem of the inner organisation of the movement 1s not one of 
principle, but of expediency. 


The best kind of organisation is not that which places a large 
intermediary apparatus between the leadership of the movement and the 
individual followers, but rather that which functions with the smallest possible 
intermediary apparatus. 


For it is the task of such an organisation to transmit a certain idea, which 
originated in the brain of one individual, to a multitude of people and to 
supervise the manner in which this idea is being put into practice. 


From any and every point of view, therefore, the organisation is only a 
necessary evil. At best it is only a means to an end, at the worst, an end in 


388 


itself. 


Since the world produces more mechanically-minded beings than 
idealists, it will always be easier to develop the form of an organisation than 
its substance, that is to say, the ideals which it is meant to serve. 


The march of any ideal which strives towards practical fulfilment, and in 
particular those ideals which are of a reformatory character, may be roughly 
sketched as follows: 


A creative idea takes shape in the mind of somebody who thereupon 
feels himself called upon to transmit this idea to the world. He propounds his 
faith to others and thereby gradually gains a certain number of followers. 


This direct and personal way of promulgating one’s ideas among one’s 
contemporaries is the most natural and the best, but as the movement develops 
and secures a large number of followers it gradually becomes impossible for 
the original founder of the doctrine on which the movement is based, to carry 
on his propaganda personally among his many followers and at the same time 
to guide the course of the movement. 


According as the community of followers increases, direct 
communication between the head and the individual followers becomes 
impossible. 


This intercourse must then take place through an intermediary apparatus 
introduced into the framework of the movement. Thus ideal conditions of 
intercommunication cease, and organisation has to be introduced as a 
necessary evil. 


Small subsidiary groups come into existence, as in the political 
movement, for example, where the local groups represent the germ-cells out of 
which the organisation develops later. 


But such subdivisions must not be introduced into the movement until the 
authority of the spiritual founder, and of the school he has created, are accepted 
without reservation. 


Otherwise the movement would run the risk of becoming split up by 
divergent doctrines. In this connection too much emphasis cannot be laid on the 
importance of having one geographic centre as the chief seat of the movement. 


389 


Only the existence of such a seat, or centre, around which a magic spell 
such as that of Mecca or Rome is woven, can supply a movement, with that 
permanent driving force which has its source in the internal unity of the 
movement, and the recognition of one head as representing this unity. 


When the first germ-cells of the organisation are being formed, care must 
always be taken not only to insist on the importance of the place where the idea 
originated, but to invest it with a sublime significance. 


The creative, moral and practical significance of the place whence the 
movement went forth and from which it is governed must be stressed in the 
same measure in which the original cells of the movement become so numerous 
that they have to be regrouped into larger units in the structure of the 
organisation. 


When, the number of individual followers becomes so large that direct 
personal, contact with the head of the movement is out of the question, we have 
to form those first local groups. 


As these groups multiply it becomes necessary to establish higher cadres 
in which the local groups are organised. Examples of such cadres in the 
political organisation are those of the region (Gau) and the district (Bezirk). 


Though it may be easy enough to maintain the original central authority 
over the lowest groups, it is much more difficult to do so in relation to the 
higher units of organisation which have now developed. 


Yet we must succeed in doing so, for this is an indispensable condition if 
the unity of the movement is to be guaranteed and its ideal realised. 


Finally, when those larger intermediary organisations have to be 
combined in new and still higher units, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
maintain the absolute supremacy of the original seat of the movement and its 
school of thought. 


Consequently, the mechanical forms of an organisation must only be 
introduced if, and in so far as, the spiritual authority and the ideas of the 
central seat of the organisation are shown to be firmly established. 


In the case of a political structure, this authority can frequently be 
guaranteed only by the exercise of power. 


390 


Having taken all these considerations into account, the following 
principles were laid down for the inner structure of the movement: 


(a) That at the beginning all activity should be concentrated in one town: 
namely, Munich. That a group of absolutely reliable followers should be 
trained and a school founded which would subsequently help to propagate the 
ideal of the Movement. 


That the necessary authority for later should be established by gaining 
many and visible successes in this particular place. 


To secure name and fame for the Movement and its leader it was 
necessary, not only to give, in this one town, a striking example to shatter the 
belief that the Marxist doctrine was invincible, but also to show that a counter- 
doctrine was possible. 


(b) That local groups should not be established before the supremacy of 
the central authority in Munich was definitely established and acknowledged. 


(c) That District, Regional, and Provincial groups should be formed not 
only after the need for them had become evident, but after the supremacy of the 
central authority has been satisfactorily guaranteed. 


Further, that the creation of subordinate units should depend on whether 
or not persons could be found who were qualified to undertake the leadership 
thereof. 


Here there are two alternatives: 


(a) That the movement should have the necessary funds to attract and 
train intelligent people who would be capable of becoming leaders. 


The personnel thus obtained could then be systematically employed 
according as the tactical situation and the necessity for efficiency demanded. 


This solution is the easier and the more expeditious, but it necessitates 
large financial resources, for this group of leaders can work for the Movement 
only if they are paid a salary. 


(b) Because the Movement, owing to lack of funds, is not in a position to 
employ paid officials it must begin by depending on voluntary helpers. 
Naturally this solution is slower and more difficult. 


391 


It means that the leaders of the Movement have to allow large districts to 
remain uncanvassed, unless in these respective districts a member comes 
forward who is capable and willing to place himself at the service of the 
central authority for the purpose of organising and directing the Movement in 
the region concerned. 


It may happen that in extensive regions no such leader can be found, but 
that at the same time in other regions two or three or even more persons appear 
whose capabilities are almost on a level. 


The difficulty which this situation involves is very great and can be 
overcome only with the passage of time. 


The necessary condition for the establishment of any branch of the 
organisation must always be that a person can be found who 1s capable of 
fulfilling the functions of a leader. 


Just as the army and all its various units of organisation are useless if 
there are no officers, so any political organisation is worthless, if it has not the 
right kind of leaders. If an inspiring personality who has the gift of leadership 
cannot be mound for the organisation and direction of a local group it 1s better 
for the Movement to refrain from establishing such a group, than to run the risk 
of failure after the group has been founded. 


A necessary qualification for leadership is the possession, not only of 
will-power, but of efficiency, and will-power and energy must be considered 
as more important than the intellect of a genius. 


The most valuable association of qualities is a combination of talent, 
determination and perseverance. 


(12) The future of a movement is determined by the devotion, and even 
intolerance, with which its members fight for their cause. 


They must feel convinced that their cause alone is just, and they must 
carry it through to success, as against other similar organisations in the same 
field. 


It is quite erroneous to believe that the strength of a movement must 
increase if it is to be combined with other movements of a similar kind. 


Any expansion resulting from such a combination will of course mean an 


392 


increase in external development, which superficial, observers might consider 
to be also an increase of power; but in reality the movement thus admits 
outside elements which will subsequently weaken its constitutional vigour. 
Though it may be said that one movement is identical in character with another, 
in reality no such identity exists. 


If it did exist, then in practice there would not be two movements, but 
only one. No matter what the difference may be, even if it consists only in the 
measure in which the capabilities of the one set of leaders differ from those of 
the other, it is still there. 


It is against the natural law of all development to couple dissimilar 
organisms; for the law is that the stronger must overcome the weaker and, 
through the struggle necessary for such a conquest, increase the constitutional 
vigour and effective strength of the victor. 


By amalgamating political organisations that are approximately alike, 
certain immediate advantages may be gained, but advantages thus gained are 
bound in the long run to become the cause of internal weaknesses which will 
make their appearance later on. 


A movement can become great only if the unhampered development of its 
internal strength be safeguarded and steadfastly augmented, until victory over 
all rivals is secured. 


One may safely say that the strength of a movement and its right to 
existence can be developed only as long as it remains true to the principle that 
struggle is a necessary condition of its progress and that it has exceeded the 
maximum limit of its strength at that moment in which complete victory, 1s 
within its grasp. 


Therefore, a movement must not strive to obtain successes that will be 
only immediate and transitory, but it must show a spirit of uncompromising 
perseverance in carrying on a long struggle which will secure for it a long 
period of inner growth. 


All those movements which owe their expansion to a so-called 
combination of similar organisms, which means that their external strength is 
due to a policy of compromise, are like plants whose growth is forced ina 
hothouse. 


They shoot up rapidly, but they lack that inner strength which enables the 


393 


natural plant to grow into a tree that will withstand the storms of centuries. 


The greatness of every powerful organisation which embodies a creative 
ideal lies in the spirit of religious devotion and intolerance with which it 
stands out against all others, because it has an ardent faith in its own cause. 


If an ideal is right in itself and, furnished with the fighting weapons I 
have mentioned, wages war on this earth, then it is invincible and persecution 
will only add to its internal strength. 


The greatness of Christianity did not arise from attempts to make 
compromises with those philosophical opinions of the ancient world which 
had some resemblance to its own doctrine, but in the unrelenting and fanatical 
proclamation and defence of its own teaching. 


The apparent advance that a movement makes by associating itself with 
other movements will be easily reached and surpassed by the steady increase 
of strength which a doctrine and its organisation acquires if 1t remains 
independent and fights its own cause alone. 


(13) The movement ought to educate its adherents on the principle that 
struggle must not be considered a necessary evil, but as something desirable in 
itself. 


Therefore, they must not be afraid of the hostility which their adversaries 
manifest towards them, but they must take it as a necessary condition on which 
their own right to existence is based. 


They must not try to avoid being hated by those who are the enemies of 
our people and our Weltanschauung, but must welcome such hatred. 


Lies and calumnies are part of the method which the enemy employs to 
express his hatred. The man who is not opposed, vilified and slandered in the 
Jewish press is not a staunch German and not a true National Socialist. 


The best standard whereby the sincerity of his convictions, his character 
and strength of will can be measured is the hostility which his name arouses 
among the mortal enemies of our people. 


The followers of the Movement, and indeed the whole nation, must be 
reminded again and again of the fact that, through the medium of his 
newspapers, the Jew is always spreading falsehood. If he tells the truth on 


394 


certain occasions, it is only for the purpose of masking some greater deception, 
which turns the apparent truth into a deliberate falsehood. 


The Jew is past master in the art of lying. Falsehood and duplicity are 
the weapons with which he fights. Every calumny and falsehood published by 
the Jews are honourable scars borne by our comrades. He whom they decry 
most is nearest to our hearts and he whom they mortally hate is our best friend. 


If a comrade of ours opens a Jewish newspaper in the morning and does 
not find himself vilified there, then he has wasted the previous day, for, if he 
had achieved something, he would be persecuted, slandered, derided, and 
abused. 


Those who effectively combat this mortal enemy of our people, who is at 
the same time the enemy of an Aryan peoples and all culture, can only expect to 
arouse: opposition on the part of this race and become the object of its 
slanderous attacks. 


When these truths become part of the flesh and blood, as it were, of our 
members, then the Movement will be unshakable and invincible. 


(14) The Movement must use every possible means to cultivate respect 
for the individual personality. It must never forget that all human values are 
based on personal values, and that every idea and achievement is the fruit of 
the creative power of one man. 


We must never forget that admiration for everything that is great, 1s not 
only a tribute to one creative personality, but that all those who feel such 
admiration become thereby united under one covenant. 


Nothing can take the place of the individual, especially if the individual 
embodies in himself not the mechanical element, but the element of cultural 
creative ability. 


No pupil can take the place of the master in completing a great picture 
which he has left unfinished; and just in the same way no substitute can take the 
place of the great poet or thinker, the great statesman or the great general, for 
their activity lies in the realm of artistic creative ability which can never be 
mechanically acquired, because it is an innate and divine gift. 


The greatest revolutions and the greatest achievements of this world, its 
greatest cultural works and the immortal creations of great statesmen, are 


395 


inseparably bound up with one name which stands as a symbol for them in each 
respective case. 


Failure to pay tribute to one of those great spirits signifies a neglect of 
that enormous source, of power which lies in the remembrance of all great men 
and women. The Jew is well aware of this. He, whose great men have always 
been great only in their efforts to destroy mankind and its civilisation, takes 
good care that they are worshipped as idols. 


The Jew tries to belittle the respect in which nations hold their own great 
men and women. He stigmatises this respect as ‘the cult of personality.’ 


As soon as a nation has so far lost its courage as to submit to this 
impudent defamation on the part of the Jew, it renounces the most important 
source of its own inner strength. 


This inner force cannot arise from a policy of pandering to the masses, 
but only from the worship of men of genius, with its uplifting and ennobling 
influence, to any of our speakers. 


Consider that only six or seven poor devils who were entirely unknown 
came together to found a movement which should succeed in doing what the 
great mass-parties had failed to do, namely, to reconstruct a German Reich, 
having even greater power and glory than before. 


We should have been very pleased if we had been attacked or even 
ridiculed, but the most depressing fact was that nobody paid any attention to us 
whatsoever. This utter lack of interest in us caused me great mental distress at 
that time. 


When I entered the circle of these men there was not yet any question of 
a party or a movement. I have already described the impression which was 
made on me when I first came into contact with that small organisation. 


Subsequently, I had time and opportunity, to study the impossible form of 
this so-called party. The picture was indeed depressing and discouraging. It 
was a party only in name and absolutely devoid of significance. 


The committee consisted of all the party members. Somehow or other, it 
seemed just the kind of thing we were about to fight against—a miniature 
parliament. 


396 


The voting system was employed. When the members of the great 
parliaments cried until they were hoarse, at least they shouted over problems 
of importance, but here this small circle engaged in interminable discussions 
as to the form in which they might answer the letters which they were delighted 
to have received. 


Needless to say, the public knew nothing of all this. In Munich nobody 
knew of the existence of such a party, not even by name, except our own few 
members and their small circle of acquaintances. 


Every Wednesday, what was called a committee meeting was held in one 
of the cafés, and a debate was arranged for one evening each week. 


In the beginning, all the members, of the ‘movement’ were also members 
of the committee; therefore the same persons always turned up at both 
meetings. 


The first step that had to be taken was to extend the narrow limits of this 
small circle and get new members, but, above all, it was necessary to utilise 
all the means at our command for the purpose of making the movement known. 


We chose the following methods. We attempted to hold a ‘meeting’ every 
month, and later, every fortnight. 


Some of the invitations were typewritten, and some were written by 
hand. For the first few meetings we distributed them in the streets and 
delivered them personally at certain houses. 


Each one canvassed among his own acquaintances and tried to persuade 
some of them to attend our meetings. The result was lamentable. 


I still remember how I personally once delivered eighty of these 
invitations and how we waited in the evening for the crowds to come. 


After waiting in vain for a whole hour the ‘chairman’ finally had to open 
the ‘meeting.’ Again there were only seven persons present, the old familiar 
seven. 


We then changed our methods. We had the invitations typewritten and 
multi-graphed at a Munich stationer’s shop. The result was that a few more 
people attended our next meeting. 


The number increased, gradually from eleven to, thirteen, to seventeen, 


397 


to twenty-three and finally to thirty-four. We collected some money within our 
own circle, each poor soul giving a small contribution, and in that way we 
raised sufficient funds to be able to advertise one of our meetings in the 
Muinchener Beobachter, which was then an independent paper. 


This time we had an astonishing success. We had chosen the Munich 
Hofbrauhaus Keller (which must not be confounded with the Munich 
Hofbrauhaus-Festsaal) as our meeting-place. 


It was a small hall and would accommodate scarcely more than one 
hundred and thirty persons. To me, however, the hall seemed enormous, and we 
were all trembling lest this tremendous edifice would remain partly empty on 
the night of the meeting. 


At seven o’clock one hundred and eleven persons were present, and the 
meeting was opened. A Munich professor delivered the principal address, and 
I spoke after him. 


That was my first appearance in the role of public orator. The whole 
thing seemed a very daring adventure to Herr Harrer, who was then chairman 
of the Party. He was a very decent fellow, but he had an a priori conviction 
that, though I might have, quite a number of good qualities, I certainly did not 
have a talent for public speaking. 


Even later he could not be persuaded to change his opinion. Things 
turned out differently. Twenty minutes had been allotted to me for my speech on 
this occasion, which might be looked upon as our first public meeting. 


I spoke for thirty minutes, and what I always had felt deep down in my 
heart, without being able to put it to the test, was here proved to be true; I 
could make a good speech. 


At the end of the thirty minutes, it, was quite clear that all the people in 
the little hall had been profoundly impressed. The enthusiasm aroused among 
them found its first expression in the fact that my appeal to those present 
brought us donations which amounted to three hundred marks. That was a great 
relief to us. Our finances were at that time so meagre that we could not afford 
to have our party programme, or even leaflets, printed. Now we possessed at 
least the nucleus of a fund from which we could meet the most urgent and 
necessary expenses. 


The success of this first larger meeting was also important from another 


398 


point of view. I had already begun to introduce some young and fresh members 
into the committee. 


During the long period of my military service I had come to know a large 
number of good comrades whom I was now able to persuade to join our Party. 


All of them were energetic and disciplined young men who, through their 
years of military service, had been imbued with the conviction that nothing is 
impossible and that where there’s a will there’s a way. 


The need for this fresh blood became evident to me after a few weeks of 
collaboration with the new members. Herr Harrer, who was then chairman of 
the Party, was a journalist by profession, and as such, he was a well-educated 
man, but as leader of the Party he had one very serious handicap—he could not 
speak to the crowd. 


Though he did his work conscientiously, it lacked the necessary driving 
force, probably for the reason that he had no oratorical gifts whatsoever. 


Herr Drexler, at that time chairman of the Munich local group, was a 
simple working man. He, too, was not of any great importance as a speaker. 
Moreover, he was not a soldier. He had never done military service, even 
during the War, so that he, who was feeble and diffident by nature, had missed 
the only school which can transform diffident and weakly natures into real 
men. 


Therefore neither of those two men were of the stuff that would have 
enabled them to have an ardent and indomitable faith in the ultimate triumph of 
the Movement and to brush aside, with obstinate force and, if necessary, with 
brutal ruthlessness, all obstacles that stood in the path of the new ideal. 


Such a task could be carried out only by men who had been trained, body 
and soul, in those military virtues which make a man, so to speak, agile as a 
greyhound, tough as leather, and hard as Krupp steel. 


At that time I was still a soldier. Physically and mentally I had the polish 
of six years of service, so that in the beginning this circle must have looked on 
me as quite a stranger. 


In common with my army comrades, I had forgotten such phrases as, 
“That can’t be done,” or “That 1s not possible,” or “We ought not to take such a 
risk; it is too dangerous.” 


399 


The whole undertaking was, of its very nature, dangerous. At that time 
there were many parts of Germany where it would have been absolutely 
impossible to invite people openly to a national meeting that dared to make a 
direct appeal to the masses. Those who attended such meetings were usually 
dispersed and driven away with broken heads. It certainly did not call for any 
great qualities to be able to do things in that way. The largest so-called 
bourgeois mass meetings were accustomed to dissolve, and those in attendance 
would scuttle away like rabbits frightened by a dog, as soon as a dozen 
communists appeared on the scene. 


The Reds used to pay little attention to those bourgeois organisations 
where only babblers talked. They recognised the inner triviality of such 
associations much better than the members themselves and therefore felt that 
they need not be afraid of them. 


On the other hand, however, they were all the more determined to use 
every possible means of annihilating, once and for all, any movement that 
appeared to them to be dangerous. 


The most effective means which they always employed in such cases 
were terrorism and brute force. 


The Marxist leaders, whose business consisted in deceiving and 
misleading the public, naturally hated most of all a movement whose declared 
aim was to win over those masses which had hitherto been exclusively at the 
service of international Marxism in the Jewish and Stock Exchange parties. 


The mere title, ‘German Labour Party,’ irritated them. It could easily be 
foreseen that at the first opportune moment we should have to face the 
opposition of the Marxist despots who were still intoxicated with their triumph 
in 1918. 


People in the small circle of our own Movement at that time showed a 
certain amount of anxiety at the prospect of such a conflict. 


They wanted to refrain as much as possible from coming out into the 
open, because they feared that they might be attacked and beaten. 


In their minds they saw our first public meetings broken up and feared 
that the Movement might thus be ruined for ever. 


I found it difficult to defend my own opinion, which was, that the conflict 


400 


should not be evaded, but that it should be faced openly and that we should be 
armed with those weapons which are the only protection against brute force. 


Terrorism cannot be overcome by the weapons of the mind, but only by 
counter-terror. The success of our first public meeting strengthened my own 
position. The members felt encouraged to arrange for a second meeting on a 
somewhat larger scale. 


Some time in October 1919 the second larger meeting took place in the 
Eberlbraukeller. The theme of our speeches was ‘Brest-Litovsk and 
Versailles.’ There were four speakers. 


I spoke for almost an hour, and my success was even more striking than 
at our first meeting. The number of people who attended had increased to over 
one hundred and thirty. An attempt to disturb the proceedings was immediately 
frustrated by my comrades. The would-be disturbers were thrown down the 
stairs, with bruised heads. A fortnight later, another meeting took place in the 
same hall. The number in attendance had now increased to more than one 
hundred and seventy, which meant that the room was fairly well filled. I spoke 
again, and once more the success obtained was greater than at the previous 
meeting. 


Then I proposed that a larger hall should be found. After looking around 
for some time we discovered one at the other end of the town, in the Deutsches 
Reich in the Dachauer Strasse. 


The first meeting at this new rendezvous had a smaller attendance than 
the previous meeting. There were just about one hundred and forty present. The 
members of the committee began to be discouraged, and those who had always 
been sceptical were now convinced that this falling-off in the attendance was 
due to the fact that we were holding the meetings at too short intervals. 


There were lively, discussions, in which I upheld my own opinion that a 
city of seven hundred thousand inhabitants ought to be able not only to stand 
one meeting every fortnight, but ten meetings every week. 


I held that we should not be discouraged by one set-back, that the tactics 
we had chosen were correct, and that sooner or later success would be ours if 
we only continued with determined perseverance to push forward on our road. 


This whole winter of 1919-20 was one continual struggle to strengthen 
confidence in our ability to carry the Movement on to success, and, to intensify 


401 


this confidence, until it became a burning faith that could move mountains. 


Our next meeting in the same hall proved the truth of my contention. Our 
audience had increased to more than two hundred. The publicity effect and the 
financial success were splendid. 


I immediately urged that a further meeting should be held. It took pace in 
less than a fortnight, and there were more than two hundred and seventy people 
present. 


Two weeks later, we invited our followers and their friends, for the 
seventh time to attend our meeting. The same hall was scarcely large enough 
for the number that came. They amounted to more than four hundred. 


During this phase the young Movement developed its inner form. Some 
times we had more or less heated discussions within our small circle. 


On various sides—it was then just the same as it 1s to-day—objections 
were made against the idea of calling the young Movement a party. 


I have always considered such criticism as a demonstration of practical 
incapability and narrow-mindedness on the part of the critic. 


Such objections have always been raised by men who cannot 
differentiate between external appearances and inner strength, but try to judge a 
movement by the high-sounding character of the name attached to it and to this 
end they ransack the vocabulary of our ancestors, with unfortunate results. 


At that time it was very difficult to make the people understand that 
every movement is a party as long as it has not realised its ideas and thus 
achieved its purpose. It is a party no matter by what name it chooses to call 
itself. 


Any person who tries to carry into practice an original idea whose 
realisation would be for the benefit of his fellow men will first have to look 
for disciples who are ready to fight for the ends he has in view. 


Even if these aims were merely to destroy the existing party system, and 
thereby to put a stop to the process of disintegration, then all those who come 
forward as protagonists and apostles of such an ideal are a party in themselves 
as long as their final goal is not reached. 


It is only hair-splitting and playing with words if these antiquated 


402 


volkisch theorists, whose practical success is in inverse ratio to their wisdom, 
presume to think they can change the character of a movement, which 1s at the 
same time a party, by merely changing its name. 


If there 1s anything which is non-vo/kisch it is this messing about with 
old Germanic expressions, in particular, which neither suit the present time nor 
conjure up a definite picture. 


This habit of borrowing words from the dead past tends to mislead the 
people into thinking that the external trappings of its vocabulary are the 
important feature of a movement. 


It is a mischievous habit; but it is very prevalent nowadays. At that time, 
and subsequently, I had to warn followers repeatedly against these wandering 
volkisch scholars who never accomplished anything positive or practical, 
except to cultivate their own superabundant self-conceit. 


The new Movement must guard against an influx of people whose only 
recommendation is their own statement that they have been fighting for these 
same ideals for the last thirty or forty years. 


Now, if somebody has fought for forty years to carry into effect what he 
calls an ideal, and if these alleged efforts not only show no positive results, but 
have not even been able to hinder the success of the opposing party, then the 
story of those forty years of futile effort furnishes sufficient proof for the 
incompetence of such a protagonist. 


People of that kind are especially dangerous because they do not want to 
participate in the movement as ordinary members. They talk rather of the 
leading positions which, in view of their past work and also of their intended 
activities in the future, are the only positions they are fitted to fill, but woe to a 
young movement if the conduct of it should fall into the hands of such people. 


A business man who has been in charge of a great firm for forty years 
and who has completely ruined it through mismanagement 1s not the kind of 
person one would recommend as the founder of a new firm, nor would a 
volkisch-minded Methuselah who, for the space of forty years, has been 
preaching a great ideal, until it has lost all meaning and vitality, be a suitable 
leader of a fresh young movement. 


Furthermore, only a very small percentage of such people join a new 
movement with the intention of serving its ends unselfishly and helping in the 


403 


spread of its principles. 


In most cases they come because they think that, under the aegis of the 
movement, it will be possible for them to promulgate their old ideas, to the 
misfortune of their new listeners. 


Anyhow, nobody ever seems able to make out what exactly these ideas 
are. It is typical of such persons that they rant about ancient Teutonic heroes of 
the dim and distant ages, stone axes, battle-spears and shields, whereas in 
reality they themselves are the woefullest poltroons imaginable. 


For they are the very same people who brandish Teutonic tin swords that 
have been fashioned carefully according to ancient models and wear padded 
bear-skins, with the horns of oxen mounted over their bearded faces, proclaim 
that all contemporary conflicts must be decided by the weapons of the mind 
alone, and skedaddle at the very sight of a communist cudgel. Posterity will 
have little occasion to write a new epic on these heroic gladiators. 


I have seen too much of that kind of person not to feel a profound 
contempt for their miserable play-acting. To the masses of the nation they are 
just an object of ridicule; but the Jew finds it to his own interest to treat these 
volkisch comedians with respect and to prefer them to real men who are 
fighting to establish a German State. 


Yet such people are extremely proud of themselves. Notwithstanding 
their complete fecklessness, which is an established fact, they pretend to know 
everything better than other people; so much so, that they make themselves a 
veritable nuisance to all sincere and honest patriots, to whom not only the 
heroism of the past is worthy of honour, but who also feel bound to leave 
examples of their own work for the inspiration of the coming generation. 


Among these people there are some whose conduct can be explained by 
their innate stupidity and incompetence; but there are others who have a 
definite ulterior purpose in view. Often it is difficult to distinguish between the 
two classes. 


The impression which I often get, especially of those so-called religious 
reformers whose creed is grounded on ancient Germanic customs, is that they 
are the missionaries and protégés of those forces which do not wish to see a 
national revival taking place in Germany. 


All their activities tend to turn the attention of, the people away from the 


404 


necessity of fighting together for a common cause against the common enemy, 
namely, the Jew. 


More ever, that kind of preaching induces the people to use up their 
energies, not in fighting for the common cause, but in absurd and ruinous 
religious controversies within their own ranks. 


These are definite grounds that make it absolutely necessary for the 
movement to be dominated by a strong central force which 1s embodied in the 
authoritative leadership. 


In this way alone is it possible to counteract the activity of such fatal 
elements, and that is just the reason why these volkisch Ahasueruses are 
vigorously hostile to any movement whose members are firmly united under 
one leader and one discipline. 


Those people of whom I have, spoken hate such a movement because it 
is capable of putting a stop to their mischief. 


It was not without good reason that when we laid down a clearly defined 
programme for the new movement we excluded the word volkisch from it. 


The concept underlying the term volkisch cannot serve as the basis of a 
movement, because it is too indefinite and general in its application. 
Therefore, if somebody calls himself vé/kisch this cannot be taken as a sign of 
party membership. 


Because this concept is practically indefinable it gives rise to various 
interpretations and thus people can use it all the more easily as a sort of 
personal recommendation. 


Whenever such a vague concept, which 1s subject to so many 
interpretations, is admitted into a political movement it tends to break up the 
disciplined solidarity of the fighting forces. 


No such solidarity can be maintained if each individual member is 
allowed to define for himself what he believes and what he is willing to do. 


One feels it a disgrace when one notices the kind of people who trot 
about nowadays with the vélkisch symbol stuck in their buttonholes, and at the 
same time realises how many people have various ideas of their own as to the 
significance of that symbol. 


405 


A well-known professor in Bavaria, a famous combatant who fights only 
with the weapons of the mind and who boasts of having laid siege to Berlin 
(with the weapons of the mind, of course), believes that the word voélkisch is 
synonymous with ‘monarchical.’ 


But this learned authority has hitherto neglected to explain how our 
German monarchs of the past can be identified with what we generally mean 
by the word volkisch to-day. 


I am afraid he will find himself at a loss, if he is asked to give a precise 
answer, for it would be very difficult indeed to imagine anything less volkisch 
than were most of those German monarchical states. 


Had they been otherwise they would not have disappeared; or if they 
were volkisch, then the fact of their downfall world have to be taken as 
evidence that the volkisch Weltanschauung 1s false. Everybody interprets this 
concept in his own way, but such multifarious opinions cannot be adopted as 
the basis of a militant political movement. 


I need not call attention to the absolute lack of worldly wisdom, and 
especially failure to understand the soul of the nation, which is displayed by 
these volkisch John-the-Baptists of the twentieth century. 


Sufficient attention has been called to these people by the ridicule which 
the left-wing parties have heaped on them. They allow them to babble on and 
sneer at them. 


I do not set much value on the friendship of people who do not succeed 
in getting themselves disliked by their enemies. 


Therefore, we considered the friendship of such people as not only 
worthless, but even dangerous to our young Movement. 


That was the principal reason why we first called ourselves a Party. We 
hoped that by giving ourselves such a name we might scare away a whole host 
of volkisch dreamers, and that was also the reason why we named our Party, 
The National Socialist German Labour Party. 


The first term, Party, kept away all those dreamers who live in the past 
and all lovers of bombastic nomenclature, as well as those who went around 
beating the big drum for the volkisch idea. 


406 


The full name of the Party kept away all those heroes whose weapon is 
the sword of the spirit and all those whining poltroons who take refuge behind 
their so-called ‘intelligence’, as if it were a kind of shield. 


It was only to be expected that this latter class would launch a massed 
attack against us after our Movement had started; but, of course, it was only a 
pen-and-ink attack, for the goose-quill is the only weapon which these vélkisch 
heroes wield. 


We had declared one of our principles thus, “We shall meet violence 
with violence in our own defence.” 


Naturally, that principle disturbed the equanimity of the knights of the 
pen. They reproached us bitterly not only for what they called our crude 
worship of the cudgel, but also because, according to them, we had no 
intellectual forces on our side. 


These charlatans did not think for a moment that a Demosthenes could be 
reduced to silence at a mass meeting by fifty idiots who had come there to 
shout him down and use their fists against his supporters. 


The innate cowardice of the pen-and-ink charlatan prevents him from 
exposing himself to such a danger, for he always works in ‘peace and quiet’ 
and never dares to make a noise or come forward in public. 


Even to-day I must warn the members of our young Movement in the 
strongest possible terms to guard against the danger of falling into the snare of 
those who claim to work in ‘peace and quiet,’ for they are not only a white- 
livered lot, but are also and always will be ignorant do-nothings. A man who 
is aware of certain happenings and knows that a certain danger threatens, and 
at the same time sees a certain remedy which can be employed against it, is in 
duty bound not to work in “peace and quiet,’ but to come into the open and 
publicly fight for the destruction of the evil and the acceptance of his own 
remedy. 


If he does not do so, then he is neglecting his duty and shows that he is 
weak in character and that he fails to act either because of his timidity, his 
indolence or his incompetence. 


Most of those who work in ‘peace and quiet,’ generally pretend to know 
God knows what. Not one of them is capable of any real achievement, but they 
keep on trying to fool the world with their antics. 


407 


Though quite indolent, they try to create the impression that their 
peaceful, quiet work keeps them very busy. To put it briefly, they are sheer 
swindlers, political jobbers who feel chagrined by the honest work which 
others are doing. 


When you find one of these vo/kisch moths talking of the value of “peace 
and quiet,’ you may be sure that you are dealing with a fellow who does no 
productive work at all, but steals from others the fruits of their honest labour. 


In addition to all this one ought to note the arrogance and conceited 
impudence with which these obscurantist idlers try to tear to pieces the work 
of other people, criticising it with an air of superiority, and thus playing into 
the hands of the mortal enemy of our people. 


Even the simplest follower who has the courage to stand on the table in 
some beer-hall where his enemies are gathered, and manfully and openly 
defend his position against them, achieves a thousand times more than these 
slinking hypocrites. 


He will convert at least one or two people to believe in the movement. 
We can examine his work and test its effectiveness by its actual results, but 
those cowardly swindlers, who praise their own work done in “peace and 
quiet’ and shelter under the cloak of anonymity, are just worth less drones, in 
the truest sense of the term, and are utterly useless for the purpose of our 
national reconstruction. 


At the beginning of 1920 I put forward the idea of holding our first mass 
meeting. On this proposal there were differences of opinion amongst us. Some 
leading members of our Party thought that the time was not ripe for such a 
meeting and that the result might be detrimental. 


The press of the Left had begun to take notice of us and we were lucky 
enough to be able gradually to arouse their wrath. We had begun to appear at 
other meetings and to ask questions or contradict the speakers, with the natural 
result, that we were shouted down forthwith, but still we thereby gained 
something. 


People began to know of our existence and the better they understood us, 
the stronger became their aversion and their enmity. 


Therefore we might expect that a large contingent of our ‘friends’ from 
the Red camp would attend our first mass meeting. 


408 


I fully realised that there was a great probability that our meeting would 
be broken up, but we had to face the fight, if not now, then some months later. 


It was up to us from the very first to immortalise the Movement by 
defending it in a spirit of blind faith and ruthless determination. 


I was well acquainted with the mentality of all those who belonged to the 
Red camp and I knew quite well that if we opposed them tooth and nail not 
only would we make an impression on, them, but we might even win new 
followers for ourselves. Therefore, I felt that we must be prepared to offer 
such resistance. 


Herr Harrer was then chairman of our Party. He did not see eye to eye 
with me as to the opportune time for our first mass meeting. Accordingly, he 
felt himself obliged as an upright and honest man to resign from the leadership 
of the Movement. 


Herr Anton Drexler took his place. I kept the work of organising the 
propaganda in my own hands and carried it out uncompromisingly. 


We decided on February 24th, 1920, as the date for the first great 
popular meeting to be held under the auspices of this Movement which was 
hitherto unknown. 


I made all the preparatory arrangements personally. They did not take 
very long. The whole apparatus of our organisation was such that we were 
able to make rapid decisions. 


Within the space of twenty-four hours, we had to be able to arrange mass 
meetings at which our attitude on current problems was made known. 


The holding of these meetings was announced by means of posters and 
leaflets, the contents of which was in accordance with the principles which I 
have already laid down in dealing with propaganda in general. 


They were produced in a form which would appeal to the crowd. They 
concentrated on a few points which were repeated again and again. 


The text was concise and definite, an absolutely dogmatic form of 
expression being used. We distributed these posters and leaflets with a dogged 
energy and then we patiently waited for the effect they would produce. 


For our principal colour we chose red, as it has an exciting effect on the 


409 


eye and was calculated to arouse the attention of our opponents and irritate 
them. 


Thus they would have to take notice of us whether they liked it or not and 
would not forget us. 


During the period which followed, the close bond of union between the 
Marxists and the Centre party (in Bavaria as elsewhere) was clearly revealed 
by the strenuous efforts made by the Bavarian People’s Party, which was 
omnipotent here to counteract the effect which our placards were having on the 
‘Red’ masses. 


If the police could find no other grounds for prohibiting the display of 
our placards, then they might claim that we were disturbing the traffic in the 
streets. Thus the so-called German National People’s Party calmed the 
anxieties of their ‘Red’ allies by completely prohibiting those placards which 
proclaimed a message that was bringing back hundreds of thousands of 
workers who had been misled by international agitators and worked up against 
their own nation to the bosom of their own people. 


These placards bear witness to the bitterness of the struggle in which the 
young Movement was then engaged. 


Future generations will find in these placards documentary evidence of 
our determination and the justice of our own cause. They will also prove how 
the so-called national officials took arbitrary action to strangle a movement 
that did not please them, because it was making the broad masses of the people 
national-minded and winning them back to their own racial stock. 


These placards will also help to refute the theory that there was then a 
national, government in Bavaria and they will afford documentary confirmation 
of the fact that if Bavaria remained national-minded during the years 1919, 
1920, 1921, 1922 and 1923, this was not due to a national government, but was 
because the national spirit gradually gained a deeper hold on the people and 
the government was forced to follow public feeling. 


The government authorities themselves did everything in their power to 
hamper this process of recovery and make it impossible, but in this connection 
two officials must be mentioned as outstanding exceptions. 


Ernst Pohner was Chief of Police at the time. He had a loyal counsellor 
in Dr. Frick, who was his chief executive officer. These were the only men 


410 


among the higher officials who had the courage to place the interests of their 
country before their own interests in holding on to their jobs. 


Of those in responsible positions, Ernst Pohner was the only one who 
did not pay court to the mob, but felt that his duty was towards the nation as 
such and was ready to risk and sacrifice everything, even his personal 
livelihood, to help in the restoration of the German people, whom he dearly 
loved. 


For that reason he was a bitter thorn in the side of the venal group of 
government officials. It was not the interests of the nation or the necessity of a 
national revival that inspired or directed their conduct. They simply truckled to 
the wishes of the government, as their employer, but they had no thought 
whatsoever for the national welfare for which they were responsible. 


Above all, Pohner was one of those people who, in contradiction to the 
majority of our so-called defenders of the authority of the State, did not fear to 
incur the enmity of the traitors to the country and the nation, but rather courted 
it as mark of honour. 


For such men the hatred of the Jews and Marxists, and the lies and 
calumnies they spread concerning them, was their only source of happiness in 
the midst of the national misery. POhner was a man of absolute honesty, classic 
simplicity and German straightforwardness for whom the saying “Better dead 
than a slave” is not an empty phrase, but the essence of his being. 


In my opinion, he and his collaborator, Dr. Frick, were the only men then 
holding positions in Bavaria who have the right to be considered as having 
taken an active part in the creation of a national Bavaria. 


Before holding our first great mass meeting it was necessary not only to 
have our propaganda material ready, but also to have the main items of our 
programme printed. 


In the second volume of this book I shall give a detailed account of, the 
guiding principles which we then followed in drawing up our programme. 


Here I will only say that, the programme was arranged not merely to set 
forth the form and scope of the young Movement, but also with an eye to 
making it understood by the broad masses. 


The so-called intellectual circles made jokes and sneered at it and then 


411 


tried to criticise it, but the effect of our programme proved that the ideas which 
we then held were right. 


During those years I saw dozens of new movements arise and disappear 
without leaving a trace behind. Only one movement had survived; it is the 
National Socialist German Labour Party. 


To-day Iam more convinced than ever before that, though they may 
combat us and try to paralyse our Movement, and though pettifogging party 
ministers may forbid us the right of free speech, they cannot prevent the 
triumph of our ideals. 


When the present system of state administration and even the names of 
the political parties that represent it will be forgotten, the programmatic basis 
of the National Socialist Movement will supply the groundwork on which the 
future State will be built. 


The meetings which we held before January 1920 had enabled us to 
collect the financial means that were necessary to have, our first pamphlets and 
posters and our programme printed. 


I shall bring the first part of this book to a close by referring to our first 
great mass meeting, because that meeting marked the occasion on which the 
Party shed its fetters as a small association and exercised for the first time a 
definite influence on public opinion which is the most powerful factor of our 
age. At that time my chief anxiety was that we might not fill the hall and that we 
might have to face empty benches. I myself was firmly convinced that if only 
the people would come, this day would turn out a great success for the young 
movement so that it was with a feeling of tense excitement that I waited 
impatiently for the evening to come. 


It had been announced that the meeting would begin at 7.30 p.m. A 
quarter of an hour before the opening time I entered the Festsaal of the 
Hofbrauhaus in the Platz in Munich and my heart nearly burst with joy. 


The great hall—for at that time it seemed very big to me—was filled to 
overflowing. Nearly two thousand persons were present, and, above all, those 
people had come whom we had always wished to reach. 


More than half the audience consisted of persons who seemed to be 
communists or independents. Our first great demonstration was destined, in 
their view, to come to an abrupt end. 


412 


But they were mistaken. When the first speaker had finished I got up to 
speak. After a few minutes I was met with a hailstorm of interruptions, and 
violent encounters broke out in the body of the hall. 


A handful of my loyal war-comrades and some other followers grappled 
with the disturbers and gradually restored a semblance of order. I was able to 
continue my speech. 


After half an hour the applause began to drown the interruptions and the 
cat-calls. Then I turned to the question of our programme, which I proceeded to 
elucidate for the first time. 


Then interruptions gradually ceased and applause took their place. 


When I finally came to explain the twenty-five points and laid them, 
point by point, before the masses gathered there and asked them to pass their 
own judgment on each point, one after another was accepted with increasing 
enthusiasm. 


When the last point was reached I had before me a hall full of people 
united by a new conviction, a new faith and a new resolve. 


Nearly four hours had passed, when the hall began to clear. As the 
masses streamed towards the exits, crammed shoulder to shoulder, shoving and 
pushing, I knew that a Movement was now set afoot among the German people 
which would never fade into oblivion. 


A fire had been kindled from whose glowing heat the sword would be 
fashioned which would restore freedom to the German Siegfried and bring 
back life to the German nation. 


Beside the revival which I then foresaw, I also felt that the Goddess of 
Vengeance was now getting ready to redress the wrongs of November 9th 
1918. 


The hall was emptied. The Movement was on the march.

VOLUME TWO THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST 
MOVEMENT 


415 


416 


CHAPTER |: WELTANSCHAUUNG AND PARTY 


On February 24th 1920, the first great mass meeting under the auspices 
of, the new movement took place. In the Hofbrauhaus-Festsaal in Munich the 
twenty-five theses which constituted the programme of our new Party were 
expounded to an audience of nearly two thousand people and each thesis was 
enthusiastically received. 


Thus we brought to the knowledge of the public the first principles and 
lines of action along which was to be conducted the new struggle for the 
abolition of a confused mass of obsolete ideas and opinions which had obscure 
and often pernicious tendencies. 


A new force was to make its appearance among the timid and cowardly 
bourgeoisie. This force was destined to impede the triumphant advance of the 
Marxists and bring the chariot of Fate to a standstill just as it seemed about to 
reach its goal. 


It was evident that this new movement could gain the public significance 
and support which are necessary prerequisites in such a gigantic struggle only 
if it succeeded from the very outset in awakening a sacred conviction in the 
hearts of its followers. 


It was not a case of introducing a new electoral-slogan into the political 
field, but that an entirely new Weltanschauung of radical significance had to 
be established. One must try to recall from what a feeble jumble of opinions 
the so-called party programmes are usually ‘cooked’ and brushed up or 
remodelled from time to time. 


If we want to gain an insight into these programmatic monstrosities we 
must carefully investigate the motives which inspire the average bourgeois 
‘programme committee.’ 


They are always influenced by one and the same preoccupation when 
they introduce something new into their programme or modify something 
already contained in it, namely, the results of the next election. 


The moment these artists in parliamentary government have the first 
glimmering of a suspicion that their beloved public may be ready to kick up its 


417 


heels and escape from the harness of the old party wagon they begin to paint 
the shafts in new colours. 


On such occasions the party astrologists and horoscope readers, the so- 
called ‘shrewd and experienced men,’ come forward. For the most part they 
are old parliamentary hands whose political schooling has furnished them with 
ample experience. 


They can remember former occasions when the masses showed signs of 
losing patience and they now sense the imminence of a similar situation. 


Resorting to their old prescription, they form a ‘committee.’ They go 
around among their beloved public and listen to what is being said. They 
carefully digest newspaper articles and gradually begin to sense what the 
broad masses really want, what they abhor and what they hope for. 


Every section of the working community and every class of employee is 
carefully studied and their secret wishes weighed and considered. 


Even the malicious slogans of a dangerous opposition are now suddenly 
looked upon as worthy of consideration, and to the astonishment of those who 
originally coined and circulated them, appear innocently and as a matter of 
course in the official vocabulary of the older parties. 


So the committees meet to revise the old programme and draw up a new 
one, for these people change their convictions just as the soldier changes his 
shirt in war-time when the old one is lousy. 


In the new programme, everyone gets everything he wants. The farmer is 
assured that the interests of agriculture will be safeguarded, the industrialist is 
assured of protection for his products, the consumer is assured that his interests 
will be protected in regards to market prices. 


Teachers are given higher salaries and civil servants will have better 
pensions. Widows and orphans will receive generous assistance from the 
State. 


Trade will be promoted. Tariffs will be lowered and even taxes, though 
they cannot be entirely abolished, will be almost done away with. 


It sometimes happens that one section of the public is forgotten or that 
one of the demands mooted by the public has not reached the ears of the party. 


418 


In such a case what can still be pushed on to the programme, 1s hastily 
added, until finally it is felt that there are good grounds for hoping that the 
whole host of Philistines, including their wives, will have their anxieties laid 
to rest and will beam with satisfaction once again. 


And so, internally armed with faith in the goodness of God and the 
impenetrable stupidity of the electorate, the struggle for what is called ‘the 
reconstruction of the Reich’ can now begin. 


When the election day is over and the parliamentarians have held their 
last public meeting for the next five years, when they can leave their job of 
getting the populace to toe the line and can now devote themselves to higher 
and more pleasing tasks, then the programme committee is dissolved. 


The struggle for the progressive reorganisation of public affairs becomes 
once again a business of earning one’s daily bread, which for the 
parliamentarian, merely means drawing his salary. Morning after morning, the 
honourable member wends his way to the House, and though he may not enter 
the Chamber itself, he gets at least as far as the lobby, where there is the 
register of members attending the meeting. 


His onerous service on behalf of his constituents consists in entering his 
name and he receives in return a small indemnity as the well-earned reward of 
his unceasing and exhausting labours. 


After the lapse of four years, or if any crisis arises in which parliament 
seems faced with the danger of dissolution, these gentlemen are suddenly fired 
with the desire for action. 


Just as the grub-worm cannot help growing into a cockchafer, these 
parliamentarian worms leave the great House of Puppets and on new wings 
flutter out among the beloved public. 


They address the electors once again, give an account of the enormous 
labours they have accomplished and emphasise the malicious obstinacy of their 
opponents. 


They do not always meet with grateful applause, for occasionally the 
unintelligent masses throw rude and unfriendly remarks in their faces. 


When this spirit of public ingratitude reaches a certain pitch, there is 
only one way of saving the situation. The prestige of the party must be 


419 


burnished up once again. The programme has to be amended, the committee is 
called into existence once more, and so the swindle begins anew. 


Once we understand the impenetrable stupidity of our public, we cannot 
be surprised that such tactics prove successful. Led by the press and blinded 
once again by the alluring appearance of the new programme, the bourgeois, as 
well as the proletarian herds of voters, faithfully return to the fold and re-elect 
their old deceivers. 


The ‘people’s man’ and labour candidate now change back again into the 
parliamentarian grub and become fat and rotund as they batten on the leaves 
that grow on the tree of public life to be retransformed into the glittering 
butterfly after another four years have passed. 


Scarcely anything can be so depressing as to watch this process in sober 
reality and to be forced to observe this repeatedly recurring fraud. 


On a spiritual training ground of that kind it is not possible for the 
bourgeois forces to develop the strength which is necessary to carry on the 
fight against the organised might of Marxism. Indeed, they have never seriously 
thought of doing so. 


Despite the admitted limitations or mental inferiority of the white race’s 
parliamentary ‘medicine-men,’ they cannot seriously imagine that they can use 
Western Democracy as a weapon to fight against an ideology whose supporters 
regard democracy and all its ramifications merely as a means of paralysing 
their opponents and gaining for themselves a free hand to put their own 
methods into action. Certain groups of Marxists are, for the time being, using 
all their ingenuity to create the impression that they are inseparably attached to 
the principles of democracy. 


It may be well to recall the fact that, when a crisis arose, these same 
gentlemen snapped their fingers at the principle of decision by majority vote, 
as that principle is understood by Western Democracy. 


Such was the case in those days when the bourgeois parliamentarians 
believed that the security of the Reich was guaranteed by the monumental 
short-sightedness of the overwhelming majority, whereas the Marxists, backed 
by a mob of loafers, deserters, political place-hunters and Jewish would-be 
literary men, simply seized the reins of government. 


This was a terrible blow to democracy. Only those credulous 


420 


parliamentary wizards who represented bourgeois democracy could have 
believed that the brutal determination of those whose interest it is to spread the 
Marxist world-pest, of which they are the carriers, could for a moment, now, 
or in the future, be held in check by the magical formulas of western 
parliamentarianism. 


Marxism will march shoulder to shoulder with democracy until it 
succeeds indirectly in securing for its own criminal purposes, even the support 
of the intelligentsia of the nation whom Marxism has set out to exterminate. 


But, if the Marxists should one day come to believe that there was a 
danger that from this witch’s cauldron of our parliamentary democracy a 
majority might be concocted, which, if merely by reason of its numerical 
weight, would be ina position to legislate and thus to constitute a serious 
threat to Marxism, then the whole parliamentarian hocus-pocus would be at an 
end. 


Instead of appealing to the democratic conscience, the leaders of the Red 
International would immediately send forth a furious rallying-cry to the 
proletarian masses and the ensuing fight would not take place in the sedate 
atmosphere of parliament, but in the factories and in the streets. 


Then democracy would be annihilated forthwith, and what the 
intellectual prowess of the apostles who represented the people in parliament 
had failed to accomplish, would now be successfully carried out by dint of the 
crow-bar and the sledge-hammer of the exasperated proletarian masses just as 
in the autumn of 1918. 


At one fell swoop they would make the bourgeois world see the madness 
of thinking that the Jewish drive towards world-conquest can be effectually 
opposed by means of Western Democracy. 


As I have said, only a very credulous soul could think of binding himself 
to observe the rules of the game when he has to face a player for whom those 
rules are nothing but a pretext for bluff or for serving his own interests, so that 
he will discard them when they prove no longer useful for his purpose. All the 
parties that profess so-called bourgeois principles look upon political life as 
being in reality a struggle for seats in parliament. The moment their principles 
and convictions are of no further use in that struggle they throw them 
overboard, as if they were sand ballast, and the programmes are constructed in 
such a way that they can be dealt with in like manner. 


421 


But such a practice has a correspondingly weakening effect on the 
strength of the parties concerned. They lack the great magnetic force which 
alone attracts the broad masses, for the masses always respond to the 
compelling force which emanates from absolute faith in the ideas put forward, 
combined with an indomitable zest to fight for and defend them. 


At a time when the one side, armed with all the weapons of its 
Weltanschauung, no matter how criminal, makes an attack against the 
established order, the other side will be able to resist only if its resistance 
takes the form of a new faith. In our case, this is a political faith which 
exchanges the slogans of weak and cowardly defence for the battle-cry of a 
courageous and ruthless attack. 


Our present Movement is accused, especially by the so-called national 
bourgeois cabinet ministers (the Bavarian representatives of the Centre, for 
example) of heading towards a revolution. 


We have only one answer to give to those political pygmies, namely, ‘We 
are trying to remedy that which you, in your criminal stupidity, have failed to 
accomplish. By your parliamentarian jobbing you have helped to drag the 
nation into ruin, but we, by our aggressive policy, are setting up a new 
Weltanschauung which we shall defend with indomitable devotion. Thus we 
are building the steps on which our nation once again may ascend to the temple 
of freedom.’ 


Thus during the first stages of founding our Movement we had to take 
special care that our militant group, which fought for the establishment of a 
new and exalted political faith, should not degenerate into a society for the 
promotion of parliamentarian interests. 


The first preventive measure was to lay down a programme which of 
itself would tend towards developing a certain moral greatness that would 
scare away all the petty and weakling spirits who make up the bulk of our 
present party politicians. 


Those fatal defects which finally led to Germany’s downfall afford the 
clearest proof of how right we were in considering it absolutely necessary to 
set up programmatic aims which were sharply ,and distinctly defined. 


Because we recognised the defects above mentioned, we realised that a 
new conception of the State had to be established, which in itself became a 


422 


part of our new conception of life. 


In the first volume of this book I have already dealt with the term 
volkisch, and I said then that this term has not a sufficiently precise meaning to 
furnish the kernel around which a closely consolidated militant community 
could be formed. All kinds of persons, with all kinds of divergent, opinions, 
are, at the present time, playing their own game under the motto volkisch. 


Before I come to deal with the purposes and aims of the National 
Socialist German Labour Party I want to establish a clear understanding of 
what is meant by the concept volkisch and herewith explain its relation to our 
party movement. 


The word volkisch does not express any clearly specified idea. It may be 
interpreted in several ways and in practical application it is just as general as 
the word ‘religious,’ for instance. 


It is difficult to attach any precise meaning to this latter word, either as a 
theoretical concept or as a guiding principle in practical life. 


The word ‘religious’ acquires a precise meaning only when it is 
associated with a distinct and definite form through which the concept is put 
into practice. 


To say that a person is ‘deeply religious’ may be very fine phraseology, 
but generally speaking, it tells us little or nothing. 


There may be some few people who are content with such a vague 
description and there may even be some to whom the word conveys a more or 
less definite picture of the inner quality of a person thus described. 


But, since the bulk of the people are not philosophers or saints, such a 
vague religious idea will mean to the individual merely that he is justified in 
thinking and acting according to his own bent. 


It will not lead to that practical faith into which inner religious yearning 
is transformed only when it leaves the sphere of general metaphysical ideas 
and is moulded to a well-defined belief. 


Such a belief is certainly not an end in itself, but the means to an end. Yet 
it is means without which the end could never be reached at all. 


This end, however, is not merely something ideal, for at bottom it is 


423 


eminently practical. We must always bear in mind the fact that, generally 
speaking, the highest ideals are always the outcome of some profound vital 
need, just as the nobility of beauty lies essentially in its practical value. 


By helping to lift the human being above the level of mere animal 
existence, faith really contributes to consolidate and safeguard his very 
existence. 


Take from humanity as it exists to-day the religious beliefs which it 
generally holds and which have been consolidated through our education, so 
that they serve as moral standards in practical life, and abolish religious 
teaching without replacing it by anything of equal value and the foundations of 
human existence would be seriously shaken. 


We may safely say that man does not live merely to serve higher ideals, 
but that these ideals, in their turn, furnish the necessary conditions for his 
existence as a human being. Thus the circle is completed. 


Of course, the word ‘religious’ implies certain ideals and beliefs that are 
fundamental. Among these we may reckon the belief in the immortality of the 
soul, its future existence in eternity, the belief in the existence of a Higher 
Being, and so on. 


But all these ideas, no matter how firmly the individual believes in them, 
may be critically analysed by any person and accepted or rejected accordingly, 
until the emotional concept or yearning has been transformed into an active 
force that is governed by a clearly defined doctrinal faith. 


Such a faith constitutes the militant feature which clears the way for the 
recognition of fundamental religious ideals. Without a clearly defined belief, 
religious feeling would not only be worthless for the purposes of human 
existence, but might even contribute towards general disorganisation, on 
account of its vague and multifarious tendencies. 


What I have said about the word ‘religious’ can also be applied to the 
term volkisch. This word also implies certain fundamental ideas. 


Though these ideas are very important indeed, they assume such vague 
and indefinite forms that they cannot be estimated as having a greater value 
than mere opinions, until they become constituent elements in the structure of a 
political party. 


424 


The ideals set forth in a Weltanschauung and the demands arising from 
them cannot be realised by mere sentiment and inner longing any more than 
freedom can be won by universal yearning for it. 


Only when the idealistic longing for independence 1s organised in such a 
way that it can fight for its ideal with military force, only then can the urgent 
wish of a people become a vital reality. 


Any Weltanschauung, though a thousandfold right and supremely 
beneficial to humanity, will be of no practical assistance in moulding the life of 
a people as long as its principles have not yet become the rallying-point of a 
militant movement which, in its turn, will remain a mere party until its 
activities have led to the victory of its ideals and its party doctrines form the 
new fundamental principles of a new national community. 


If an abstract conception of a general nature is to serve as the basis of a 
future development, then the first prerequisite is to forma clear understanding 
of the nature, character and scope of this conception, since only on such a basis 
can a movement be founded which can draw the necessary fighting strength 
from the infernal homogeneity of its principles and convictions. 


A political programme must be constructed on a basis of general ideas 
and a general Weltanschauung must receive the stamp of a definite political 
faith. 


Since this faith must be directed towards ends that have to be attained in 
the world of practical reality, not only must it serve the general ideal as such, 
but it must also take into consideration the existing means that have to be 
employed for the triumph of the ideal. Here the practical wisdom, of the 
statesman must come to the assistance of the ideal, correct in the abstract, as 
evolved by the author of the political programme. 


In this way an eternal ideal, which has everlasting significance as a 
guiding star to mankind, must be adapted to the exigencies of human frailty so 
that its practical effect may not be frustrated at the very outset through those 
shortcomings which are general to mankind. 


The exponent of truth must here go hand in hand with him who has a 
practical knowledge of the mind of the people, so that from the realm of eternal 
verities and ideals what is suited to the capacities of human nature may be 
selected and given practical form. 


425 


To take abstract and general conceptions, derived froma 
Weltanschauung whichis based on a solid foundation of truth and from them to 
mould a militant community whose members have the same political faith (a 
community which is precisely defined, rigidly organised, of and mind and one 
will) is the most important task of all, far the possibility of successfully 
carrying out the idea is dependent on the successful fulfilment of this task. 


Out of the army of millions who feel, more or less clearly, the truth of 
these ideas, and may even understand them to some extent, one man must arise. 


This man must have the gift of being able to formulate from the vague 
ideas held by the masses, principles that will be as clear-cut and firm as 
granite and he must be able to fight for these principles as the only true ones, 
until a solid rock of common faith and common will emerges above the 
troubled waters of vagrant ideas. 


The general justification for such action lies in the necessity for it and 
the action of the individual will be justified by his success. 


If we try to penetrate the inner meaning of the word vdlkisch we arrive at 
the following conclusion. The current political conception of the world is that 
the State, though it possesses a creative force which can build up civilisations, 
has nothing in common with the concept of race as the foundation of the State. 


The State is considered rather as something which has resulted from 
economic necessity or is, at best, the natural outcome of political urge for 
power. 


Such a conception together with all its logical consequences, not only 
ignores the primordial racial forces that underlie the State, but it also leads to 
a minimization of the importance of the individual. 


If it be denied that races differ from one another in their cultural creative 
ability, then this same erroneous notion must necessarily influence our 
estimation of the value of the individual. The assumption that all races are 
alike leads to the assumption that nations and individuals are equal to one 
another. Therefore, international Marxism is merely the adoption by the Jew, 
Karl Marx, of a general conception of life, which had existed long before his 
day, as a definite profession of political faith. 


If it had not already existed as a widely diffused infection, the amazing 
political progress of the Marxist teaching would never have been possible. 


426 


In reality what distinguished Karl Marx from the millions who were 
affected in the same way was that, ina world already in a state of gradual 
decomposition, he used the unerring instinct of the prophetic genius to detect 
the essential poisons, so as to extract them and concentrate them, with the art of 
an alchemist, in a solution which would bring about the rapid destruction of the 
independent nations of the earth. All this was done in the service of his race. 


Thus the Marxian doctrine 1s the concentrated extract of the mentality 
which underlies the general Weltanschauung to-day. 


For this reason alone it is out of the question and even ridiculous to think 
that what is called our bourgeois world can put up any effective fight against 
Marxism, for this bourgeois world is permeated with all those same poisons, 
and its Weltanschauung in general differs from Marxism only in degree and in 
the character of the persons who hold it. 


The bourgeois world is Marxist, but believes in the possibility of a 
certain group of people—that is to say, the bourgeoisie—being able to 
dominate the world, while Marxism itself systematically aims at delivering the 
world into the hands of the Jews. 


Over against all this, the volkisch Weltanschauung recognises that the 
primordial racial elements are of the greatest significance for mankind. 


In principle, the State is looked upon only as a means to an end and this 
end is the conservation of the racial characteristics of mankind. 


The volkisch principle does not admit that one race is equal to another, 
but by recognising that they are different, separates mankind into races of 
superior and inferior quality. 


On the basis of this recognition it feels bound, in conformity with the 
Eternal Will that dominates the universe, to postulate the victory of the better 
and stronger and the subordination of the inferior and weaker thus subscribing 
to Nature’s fundamental aristocratic principle and it believes that this law 
holds good even down to the last individual organism. 


It selects individual values from the mass and thus operates as an 
organising principle, whereas Marxism acts as a disintegrating solvent. 


The vdlkisch belief holds that humanity must have its ideals, because 
ideals are a necessary condition of human existence itself. 


427 


But, on the other hand, it denies that an ethical ideal has the right to 
prevail if it endangers the existence of a race that is the champion of a higher 
ethical ideal, for ina world composed of mongrels and Negroids all ideals of 
human beauty and nobility and all hopes of an idealised future for humanity 
would be lost for ever. 


On this planet of ours human culture and civilisation are indissolubly 
bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he were to be exterminated or 
become extinct, then the dark shroud of a new barbaric era would enfold the 
earth. 


To undermine the existence of human culture by exterminating its 
custodians would be an execrable crime in the eyes of those who subscribe to 
the volkisch Weltanschauung. 


Whoever dares to raise his hand against the highest image of God, sins 
against the bountiful Creator of this marvel and contributes to the expulsion 
from Paradise. 


Hence the volkisch Weltanschauung 1s in profound accord with Nature’s 
most sacred will, because it restores the free play of the forces which, through 
reciprocal education, will produce a higher type, until finally the best portion 
of mankind will possess the earth and will be free to work in spheres which lie 
not only within, but without the limits of that earth. 


We all feel that in the distant future man may be faced with problems 
which can be solved only by a superior race of human beings, which is master 
over all the other peoples and has at its disposal the means and resources of 
the whole world. 


It is evident that such a general definition of what is implied by the term 
volkisch Weltanschauung may easily be interpreted in a thousand different 
ways. 


As a matter of fact, there is scarcely one of our recently founded 
political parties which does not in some manner have recourse to this 
conception; but the very fact of its independent existence, despite the many 
others, goes to prove its infinite variety. 


Thus the Marxist conception, directed by a central organisation endowed 
with supreme authority, is opposed by a medley of opinions which are not 
ideologically impressive in face of the solid phalanx presented by the enemy. 


428 


Victory cannot be achieved with such weak weapons. Only when the 
international Weltanschauung politically directed by organised Marxism is 
confronted by a volkisch Weltanschauung equally well-organised and equally 
well-directed will the one side do battle with the other on an equal footing and 
victory be on the side of eternal truth. 


The organisation and mobilisation of a Weltanschauung can never be 
carried out except on a basis of its clear definition. 


The function which dogma fulfils in religious beliefs comparable to the 
function which party principles fulfil in a political party which is in the 
process of being built up. It is, therefore, essential to forge an instrument 
which, like the Marxist party organisation which clears the way for 
internationalism, can be used in fighting for this ideal. This is the aim which 
the National Socialist German Labour Party pursues. 


That a definite formulation of the idea vé/kisch in connection with a 
party movement is a prerequisite for the triumph of the volkisch 
Weltanschauung 1s strikingly proved by a fact which is admitted, however 
indirectly, even by ,those who oppose such an amalgamation of the volkisch 
idea with party principles. 


The very people who never tire of insisting again and again that the 
volkisch Weltanschauung can never be the exclusive property of any 
individual, because it lies dormant or ‘lives’ in myriads of hearts, only confirm 
by their own statement the simple fact that the general presence of such ideas in 
the hearts of millions of men has not proved sufficient to prevent the victory of 
the opposing ideas, which are, admittedly, championed on the recognised party 
political lines. 


If that were not so, the German people ought already to have gained a 
sweeping victory instead of finding themselves on the brink of the abyss. 


The international ideology achieved success because it was championed 
by a militantly organised party. 

The reason for the failure hitherto sustained by the opposite ideology is 
that it lacked a united front to fight for its cause. 


It is not by allowing the right of free interpretation of its general 
principles, but only in the limited and, consequently, concentrated form of a 
political organisation that a Weltanschauung can sustain a struggle and 


429 


triumph. 


Therefore, I considered it my special duty to extract from the extensive 
but unformulated material of a general Weltanschauung the essential ideas and 
give them a more or less dogmatic form. 


Because of their precise and clear meaning, these ideas are suited to the 
purpose of uniting in a common front all those who are ready to accept them as 
principles. 


In other words, the National Socialist German Labour Party extracts the 
essential principles from the general conception of the volkisch 
Weltanschauung. 


On these principles it establishes a political doctrine which takes into 
account the practical realities of the day, the character of the times, the 
available human material and all its deficiencies. 


Through this political doctrine it is possible to bring great masses of the 
people into a systematic organisation which is the main preliminary that is 
necessary for the final triumph of this ideal.

432 


CHAPTER II: THE STATE 


As early as 1920-1921, certain circles belonging to the effete bourgeois 
class accused our Movement again and again of taking up a negative attitude 
towards the modern State. 


For that reason the motley gang of camp-followers attached to the 
various political parties, representing a heterogeneous conglomeration of 
political views, assumed the right of utilising all available means to suppress 
the protagonists of this young Movement which, was preaching a new political 
gospel. 


Our opponents deliberately ignored the fact that the bourgeois class itself 
stood for no uniform opinion as to what the State really meant and that the 
bourgeoisie did not and could not give any uniform definition of this institution. 


Those whose duty it is to explain what is meant when we speak of the 
State hold chairs in state universities, often in the department of constitutional 
law, and consider it their highest duty to find explanations and justifications for 
the more or less fortunate existence of that particular form of State which 
provides them with their daily bread. 


The more absurd such a form of State is, the more obscure, artificial and 
incomprehensible are the definitions which are advanced to explain the 
purpose of its existence. 


What, for instance, could a professor at a royal and imperial university 
write about the meaning and purpose of a State in a country whose constitution 
represented the greatest monstrosity of the twentieth century? 


That would be a difficult undertaking indeed, in view of the fact that the 
contemporary professor of constitutional law is obliged not so much to serve 
the cause of truth as to serve a definite purpose, and this purpose is to defend 
at all costs the existence of that monstrous human mechanism which we now 
call the State. 


Nobody need be surprised if concrete facts are evaded as far as, 
possible when the problem of the State is under discussion and if professors 
adopt the tactics of concealing themselves in a morass of abstract values, 


433 


duties and purposes which are described as ‘ethical’ and ‘moral.’ Generally 
speaking, these various theorists may be classed, in three groups: 


1. Those who held that the State is a more or less voluntary association 
of men under governmental authority. 


This is numerically the largest group. In its ranks are to be found those 
who worship our present principle of legalized authority. 


In their eyes the will of the people plays no part whatever in the whole 
affair. For them, the fact that the State exists 1s sufficient reason to consider it 
sacred and inviolable. 


In order to champion this aberration of the human brain one would have 
to have a sort of canine adoration for what is called the authority of the State. 


In the minds of these people the means is quickly and easily substituted 
for the end. The State no longer exists for the purpose of serving men, but men 
exist for the purpose of revering the authority of the State, which is vested in 
its functionaries, even down to the most inferior official. 


In order to prevent this placid and ecstatic adoration from changing into 
something that might become in any way disturbing, the authority of the State is 
limited simply to the task of preserving law and order. 


Thus it is no longer either a means or an end. The State must see that how 
and order are preserved and, in their turn, law and order must make the 
existence of the State possible. 


All life must move between these two poles. In Bavaria, this view is 
upheld by the artful politicians of the Bavarian Centre, which 1s called the 
‘Bavarian People’s Party.’ 


In Austria, the black-and-yellow Legitimists adopt a similar attitude. 


In the Reich, unfortunately, the so-called conservative elements often 
hold the same view. 


2. The second group is numerically somewhat smaller. 


It includes those who would make the existence of the State dependent on 
certain conditions. They insist that not only should there be a uniform system of 
government, but also, if possible, uniformity of language, if only for technical 


434 


reasons of administration. 


The authority of the State is no longer, the sole and exclusive end for 
which the State exists, but it must also promote the good of its subjects. 


Ideas of ‘freedom,’ mostly, based on a misunderstanding of the meaning 
of that word, enter into the concept of the State as it exists in the minds of this 


group. 


The form of government is no longer considered inviolable simply 
because it exists. It must submit to the test of practical efficiency. 


Its venerable age no longer protects it from criticism in the light of 
modern exigencies. Moreover, in their view, the first duty laid upon the State is 
to guarantee the economic well-being of the individual citizen. 


Hence it is judged from the practical standpoint and according to general 
principles based on the idea of economic returns. 


The chief representatives of this theory of the State are to be found 
among the average German bourgeoisie, especially our liberal democrats. 


3. The third group is numerically the smallest. In the State they see a 
means for the realisation of aims (generally vague in conception) dictated by a 
policy of power, on the part of a united people speaking the same language. 


They want a common language not only because they hope that thereby 
the State will be furnished with a solid basis for the extension of its power 
beyond its own frontiers, but also because they think—though falling into a 
fundamental error by so doing—that such a common language would facilitate 
the carrying out of a definite process of nationalisation. 


During the last century it was lamentable for those who had to witness it, 
to notice how in these circles I have just mentioned the word ‘Germanisation’ 
was frivolously played with, though often with the very best of intentions. 


I well remember how, in the days of my youth, this very term used to 
give rise to notions which were false to an incredible degree. Even in Pan- 
German circles one heard the opinion expressed that the Austrian Germans 
might very well succeed in Germanising the Austrian Slavs, if only the 
government were ready to co-operate. 


Those people did not understand that a policy of Germanisation can be 


435 


carried out only as regards territory and not as regards human beings. 


What was generally understood by this term was the enforced adoption 
of the German language, but it is almost inconceivable that people should 
imagine that a Negro or a Chinaman, for example, can become German simply 
by learning the German language, by being willing to speak it for the rest of 
their lives and even to vote in favour of some German political party. 


Our bourgeois nationalists could never clearly see that such a process of 
Germanisation is in reality de-Germanisation, for even if all the outstanding 
and, visible differences between the various peoples could be bridged over 
and finally eliminated by the use of a common language, this would give rise to 
a process of bastardisation which in this case would not signify 
Germanisation, but the annihilation of the German element. 


In the course of history it has happened only too often that a conquering 
race succeeded by force in compelling the people whom they had subjected to 
speak their tongue, with the result that after a thousand years their language 
was spoken by another people and thus the conqueror finally turned out to be 
the conquered. 


What makes a people or, to be more correct, a race, is not language but 
blood. It would therefore be justifiable to speak of Germanisation only if that 
process could change the blood of the people who were subjected to it, which 
is obviously impossible. 


A change would be possible only by a mixture of blood, but in this case 
the quality of the superior race would be debased. The final result of such a 
mixture would be that precisely those qualities were destroyed which had 
enabled the conquering race to achieve victory over an inferior people. 


It is especially cultural creative ability which disappears when a 
superior race intermixes with an inferior one, even though all the resultant 
mongrel race speaks the language of the race that had once been superior. 


For a certain time there will be a conflict between the different 
mentalities and it may be that a nation which is ina state of progressive 
degeneration will at the last moment rally its cultural creative powers and once 
again produce striking cultural masterpieces. 


These are, however, produced only by individuals belonging to the 
superior race or by hybrids of the first crossing, in whom the superior blood 


436 


has remained dominant and seeks to assert itself, but never by the last 
descendants of such hybrids. 


These are always in a state of cultural retrogression. We must consider it 
fortunate that a Germanisation of Austria according to the plan of Joseph II did 
not succeed. 


Probably the result would have been that the Austrian State would have 
survived, but at the same time the use of a common language would have 
debased the racial quality of the German element. 


In the course of centuries a certain herd instinct might have been 
developed, but the herd itself would have deteriorated in quality. It is possible 
that a constitutional State would have been established, but a culturally 
creative people would have been lost to the world. 


For the German nation it was better that this process of intermixture did 
not take place, although it was not renounced for any high-minded reasons, but 
simply through the short-sighted pettiness of the Habsburgs. 


If it had taken place, the German people could now scarcely be looked 
upon as a cultural factor. 


Not only in Austria, however, but also in Germany, these so-called 
national circles were, and still are, under the influence of similar erroneous 
ideas. 


The much favoured policy with regard to Poland which provided for the 
Germanisation of the eastern provinces was, unfortunately, practically always 
based on the same false reasoning. 


Here again it was believed that the Polish people could be Germanised 
by being compelled to use the German language. The result would have been 
fatal, for people of an alien race by expressing their alien ideas in the German 
language would have debased the dignity and nobility of our nation by their 
own inferiority. 


It is revolting to think how much damage is indirectly done to German 
prestige to-day owing to the fact that the German patois of Jews entering the 
United States enables them to be classed as Germans, because of the ignorance 
of Americans with regard to things German. Here nobody would dream of 
accepting the fact that these lousy emigrants from the East generally speak 


437 


German as proof of their German origin and nationality. What has been 
beneficially Germanised in the course of history was the land which our 
ancestors conquered with the sword and colonised with German tillers of the 
soil. 


Inasmuch as they introduced foreign blood into our national body in 
carrying out this colonisation, they helped to bring about the lamentable 
disintegration of our racial character, a process which has resulted in our 
German hyper-individualism, though this latter characteristic 1s, unfortunately, 
frequently praised even now. 


In the third group also, there are people who, to a certain degree, 
consider the State as an end in itself. Hence they consider its preservation as 
one of the highest aims of human existence. 


Summing up, we arrive at the following conclusion: A common feature 
of all these views is, that they are not grounded on a recognition of the 
profound truth that the capacity for creating cultural values is essentially based 
on the racial element. 


In accordance with this fact, the paramount purpose of the State to 
preserve and improve the race, an indispensable condition of all progress in 
human civilisation. 


Thus the Jew, Karl Marx, was able to utilise and exploit these false 
concepts and ideas on the nature and purpose of the State. 


By eliminating from the concept of the State all thought of the obligation 
which the State has towards the race, without finding any other formula that 
might be universally accepted, the bourgeois teaching prepared the way for that 
doctrine which rejects the State as such. 


That is why the bourgeois struggle against Marxian internationalism is 
doomed to fail in this particular. The bourgeois classes have already sacrificed 
the basic principles which alone could furnish a solid footing for their ideas. 


Their crafty opponent has perceived the defects in their structure and 
advances to the assault with those weapons which they themselves have 
unwittingly placed in his hands. 


Therefore any new movement which is based on the volkisch 
Weltanschauung will first of all have to put forward a clear and logical 


438 


definition of the nature and purpose of the State. 


The fundamental principle is that the State is not an end in itself, but the 
means to an end. It is the preliminary condition for the development of a higher 
form of human civilisation, but not the reason for such a development, for 
which a culturally creative race is alone responsible. 


There may be hundreds of excellent States on this earth and yet if the 
Aryan, who is the creator and custodian of civilisation, should disappear, all 
culture corresponding to the spiritual needs of the superior nations to-day 
would also disappear. We may go still further and say that the fact that States 
have been created by human beings does not exclude the possibility that the 
human race may become extinct, if the superior intellectual faculties and 
powers of adaptation were to be lost because the race possessing these 
faculties and powers had disappeared. 


If, for instance, the surface of the globe were to be shaken to-day by 
some seismic convulsion and if new Himalayas were to emerge from the 
waves of the sea, this one catastrophe alone might annihilate human 
civilisation. 


No State could continue to exist. All order would be shattered, and all 
vestiges of cultural products which had been evolved in the course of 
thousands of years would disappear. 


Nothing would be left but one tremendous field of death and destruction 
submerged in floods of water and mud. If; however, only a few people were to 
survive this terrible havoc, and if these people belonged to a definite race that 
had the innate power to build up a civilisation, when the commotion had 
passed, the earth would again bear witness to the creative power of the human 
spirit, even though a span of a thousand years might intervene. 


Only with the extermination of the last race that possesses the gift of 
cultural creativeness, and indeed only if all the individuals of that race also 
disappeared, would the earth definitely be turned into a desert. 


On the other hand, modem history furnishes examples to show that States 
which are of racial origin cannot, if the representatives of that race lack 
creative genius, preserve them from disaster and destruction. 


Just as many varieties of prehistoric animals had to give way to others 
and leave no trace behind them, so man will also have to give way, if he loses 


439 


that definite intellectual faculty which enables him to find the weapons that are 
necessary for him to preserve his own existence. 


It is not the State as such that brings about a certain definite advance in 
cultural progress. The State can only protect the race that is the cause of such 
progress. 


The State as such may well exist without undergoing any change for 
hundreds of years, though the cultural faculties and the general life of the 
people, which is shaped by these faculties, may have suffered profound 
changes, by reason of the fact that the State did not prevent a mixing of races 
from taking place. 


The present State, for instance, may continue to exist in a mere 
mechanical form, but the poison of miscegenation permeating the national body 
is bringing about a cultural decadence which is already manifesting itself in 
various symptoms of a detrimental character. 


Thus the indispensable prerequisite for the existence of a superior type 
of human beings is not the State, but the race, which is alone capable of 
producing that higher type. 


This capacity is always there, though it will lie dormant unless external 
circumstances awaken it to action. Nations, or rather races, which are 
endowed with the faculty of cultural creativeness possess this faculty ina 
latent form during periods when external circumstances are unfavourable for 
the time being. They therefore do not allow the faculty to express itself 
effectively. 


It is, therefore, outrageously unjust to speak of the pre-Christian Germans 
as uncivilised barbarians, for such they never were. 


But the severity of the climate that prevailed in the northern regions 
which they inhabited, imposed conditions of life which hampered a free 
development of their creative faculties. 


If they had come to the fairer climate of the South, with no previous 
culture whatsoever, and if they had acquired the necessary human material— 
that 1s to say, men of an inferior race—to serve them as tools in performing 
necessary labours, the cultural faculty dormant in them would have blossomed 
forth in splendour as happened in the case of the Greeks, for example. 


440 


But this primordial creative faculty in cultural things was not solely due 
to their northern climate. Neither the Laplanders nor the Eskimos would have 
become creators of a culture if they had been transplanted to the South. 


This wonderful creative faculty is a special gift bestowed on the Aryan, 
whether it lies dormant in him or becomes active, according as adverse 
conditions and surroundings prevent the active expression of that faculty or 
favourable circumstances permit it. 


From these facts the following conclusions may be drawn: The State is 
only a means to an end. 


Its end and its purpose are to preserve and promote a community of 
human beings who are physically as well as spiritually kindred. 


Above all, it must preserve the existence of the race, thereby providing 
the indispensable condition for the free development of all the forces dormant 
in this race. 


A great part of these faculties will always have to be employed in the 
first place to preserve the physical existence of the race, and only the 
remaining portion will be free to work in the field of intellectual progress. 


But, as a matter of fact, the one is always, the fundamental prerequisite 
for the other. 


Those States which do not serve this purpose have no justification for 
their existence. They are monstrosities. 


The fact that they do exist is no more of a justification than the successful 
raids carried out by a band of pirates can be considered a justification of 
piracy. 


We National Socialists, who are fighting for a new Weltanschauung, 
must never take our stand on the famous ‘basis of facts’, if these be mistaken 
facts. If we did so, we should cease to be the protagonists of a new and great 
idea and would become slaves in the service of the fallacy which is dominant 
to-day. 


We must make a clear-cut distinction between the vessel and its contents. 
The State is only the vessel and the race is what it contains. 


The vessel can have significance only if it preserves and safeguards the 


441 


contents. Otherwise it is worthless. 


Hence, the supreme purpose of the volkisch State is to guard and 
preserve those racial elements which, through their work in the cultural field, 
create that beauty and dignity which are characteristic of a higher mankind. 


As Aryans, we can consider the State only as the living organism of a 
people, an organism which does not merely preserve the existence of a people, 
but functions in such a way as to lead that people to a position of supreme 
liberty by the progressive development of its intellectual and cultural faculties. 


What they want to impose upon us as a State to-day is, in most cases, 
nothing but a monstrosity, the product of a profound human abet ration which 
brings untold suffering in its train. 


We National Socialists know that in holding these views we are taking 
up a revolutionary stand in the world of to-day and that we are branded as 
revolutionaries. 


Despite this, our views and our conduct will not be determined by the 
approbation or disapprobation of our contemporaries, but only by our duty in 
following a truth which we have acknowledged. 


In doing this we, have reason to believe that posterity will have a clearer 
insight and will not only understand the work we are doing to-day, but will 
also ratify it as the right work and will extol it accordingly. 


On these principles, we National Socialists base our standards of value 
in appraising a State. This value will be relative when viewed from the 
particular standpoint of the individual nation, but it will be absolute, when 
considered from the standpoint of humanity as a whole. 


In other words; this means that the excellence of a State can never be 
judged by the level of its culture or the degree of importance which the outside 
world attaches to its power, but that its excellence must be judged by the 
degree to which its constitution serves the race in question. 


A State may be considered as a model example if it adequately serves 
not only the vital needs of the race it represents, but if by its very existence it 
actually ensures the preservation of this same race, no matter what general 
cultural significance this constitution may have within the framework of the 
world. 


442 


For it is not the task of the State to create human capabilities, but only to 
assure free scope for the exercise of capabilities that already exist. 


On the other hand, a State may be called bad if} in spite of the existence 
of a high cultural level, it dooms to destruction the representatives of that 
culture by breaking up their racial compositeness. For the practical effect of 
such a policy would be to destroy those conditions that are indispensable for 
the ulterior existence of that culture, which the State did not create, but which 
is the fruit of the creative power inherent in the race whose existence is 
assured by being united in the living organism of the State. 


Once again, let me emphasise the fact that the State itself is not the 
substance but the form. Therefore, the cultural level of a people is not the 
standard by which we can judge the value of the State in which that people 
lives. 


It is evident that a people endowed with high creative powers in the 
cultural sphere is of more worth than a tribe of Negroes, and yet the 
constitutional organism of the former, if judged from the standpoint of 
efficiency, may be worse than that of the Negroes. 


Not even the best of States and state institutions can cultivate in a people 
faculties which they lack and which they never possessed, but a bad State may 
gradually destroy the faculties which once existed. 


This it can do by allowing or favouring the suppression of those who are 
the champions of a racial culture. 


The worth of a State can, therefore, be determined only by asking how 
far it actually succeeds in promoting the well-being of a definite race and not 
by the role which it plays in the world at large. 


Its relative worth can be estimated readily and accurately, but it is 
difficult to judge its absolute worth, because the latter is conditioned not only 
by the State, but also by the quality and cultural level of the people that belong 
to the individual State in question. 


Therefore, when we speak of the high mission of the State we must not 
forget that the high mission belongs to the people and that the business of the 
State is to use its organising powers for the purpose of furnishing the necessary 
conditions which allow this people freely to develop its creative faculties. 


443 


Again, if we ask what kind of constitution we Germans need, we must 
first have a clear notion as to the people which it is destined to embrace and 
what purpose it must serve. 


Unfortunately, German national life is not based on a uniform racial 
nucleus,. The process of welding the original elements together has not gone so 
far as to warrant us in saying that a new race has emerged. 


On the contrary, the poison which has invaded the national body, 
especially since the Thirty Years’ War, has destroyed the uniform constitution 
not only of our blood, but also of our national soul. The open frontiers of our 
native country, the association with non-German foreign elements in the 
territories that lie all along those frontiers, and especially the strong influx of 
foreign blood into the interior of the Reich itself, has prevented any complete 
assimilation of those various elements, because the influx has continued 
steadily. 


Out of this melting-pot no new race has arisen. The heterogeneous 
elements continue to exist side by side, and the result is that, especially in 
times of crisis, when the herd usually flocks together, the Germans disperse in 
all directions. 


The fundamental racial elements are not only different in different 
districts, but there are also various elements within these various districts. 


Beside the Nordic type we find the East-European type, beside the 
Eastern there is the Dinaric, the Western type intermingling with both, and 
hybrids among them all. That is a grave drawback to us. 


Through it the Germans lack that strong herd instinct which arises from 
unity of blood and saves nations from ruin in dangerous and critical times, 
because on such occasions small differences disappear, and a united herd faces 
the enemy. 


What we understand by the word hyper-individualism is explained by 
the fact that our primordial racial elements have existed side by side without 
ever consolidating. 


In times of peace such a situation may offer some advantages but taken 
all in all, it has prevented us from becoming the masters of the world. 


If, in its historical development, the German people had possessed that 


444 


united herd instinct by which other peoples have so much benefited, then the 
German Reich would probably be mistress of the globe to-day. 


World history would have taken another course and no man can tell if 
what many benighted pacifists hope to attain by petitioning, whining and 
crying, might not have been achieved in this way, namely, a peace which would 
not be based upon the waving of olive branches and tearful misery-mongering 
of pacifist old women, but a peace guaranteed by the triumphant sword of a 
people endowed with the power to master the world and administer it in the 
service of a higher civilisation. 


The fact that our people were not a national entity based on unity of 
blood has been the source of untold misery for us. 


To many petty German potentates it gave residential capital cities; but the 
German people as a whole was deprived of its right to rulership. 


Even to-day our nation still suffers from this lack of inner unity, but what 
has been the cause of our past and present misfortunes may turn out a blessing 
for us in the future. 


Though on the one hand it may be a drawback that our racial elements 
were not welded together, so that no homogeneous national body could 
develop, on the other hand, it was fortunate that, since at least a part of our best 
blood was thus kept pure, its racial quality was not debased. A complete 
assimilation of all our racial elements would certainly have brought about a 
homogeneous national organism, but, as has been proved in the case of every 
racial mixture, it would have been less capable of creating a civilisation than 
would its best original elements. 


One benefit resulting from the fact that there was no all-round 
assimilation is the fact that even now we have large groups of German Nordic 
people within our national organism, and that their blood has not been mixed 
with the blood of other races. 


We must look upon this as our most valuable asset for the sake of the 
future. 


During that dark period of absolute ignorance in regard to all racial 
laws, when each individual was considered to be ona par with every other, 
there could be no clear appreciation of the difference between the various 
fundamental racial characteristics. 


445 


We know to-day that a complete assimilation of all the various elements 
which constitute the nation might have resulted in giving us a larger share of 
external power. 


On the other hand, the highest of human aims would not have been 
attained, because the only kind of people, which Fate has obviously chosen to 
bring about this perfection, would have been lost in the general mixture of 
races which would have resulted from such a racial amalgamation. 


Nevertheless, what has been prevented by a friendly Destiny, without 
any assistance on our part, must now be reconsidered and utilised in the light 
of our new knowledge. 


He who talks of the German people as having a mission to fulfil on this 
earth must know that this mission cannot be fulfilled except by the building up 
of a State whose highest purpose is to preserve and promote those nobler 
elements of our race, and of the whole of mankind, which have remained 
unimpaired. 


Thus, for the first time a high inner purpose is accredited to the State. In 
contrast to the ridiculous thesis that the State should do no more than act as the 
guardian of public law and order, so that everybody can peacefully dupe 
everybody else, it is given a very high mission indeed in preserving and 
encouraging the highest types of humanity which a beneficent Creator has 
bestowed on this earth. 


Out of a dead mechanism which claims to be an end in itself a living 
organism shall arise which has to serve one purpose exclusively, and that a 
purpose which belongs to a higher order of ideas. 


As a State, the German Reich shall include all Germans, Its task 1s not 
only to gather in and foster the most valuable sections of our people, but to 
lead them slowly and surely to a dominant position in the world. 


Thus a period of stagnation is superseded by a period of effort. And 
here, and in every other sphere, the proverb holds good, that to rest is to rust, 
and furthermore the proverb, that victory will always be won by him who 
attacks. 


The higher the final goal which we strive to reach, and the less it be 
understood at the time by the broad masses, the more magnificent will be our 
success. 


446 


That is the lesson which history teaches, and the achievement will be all 
the more significant, 1f the end 1s conceived in the right way and the fight 
carried through with unswerving persistence. 


Many of the officials who direct the affairs of State nowadays may find it 
easier to work for the maintenance of the present order than to fight for a new 
one. 


They will find it more comfortable to look upon the State as a 
mechanism, whose purpose is its own preservation, and to say that ‘their lives 
belong to the State,’ as if anything that grew from the inner life of the nation can 
logically serve anything but the national life, and as if man could have any finer 
task than to serve his fellow beings. 


Naturally, it is easier, as I have said, to consider the authority of the State 
as nothing but the formal mechanism of an organisation, rather than as the 
sovereign incarnation of a people’s instinct for self-preservation on this earth. 


For these weak minds the State (and the authority of the State) is nothing 
but an aim in itself, while for us it is an effective weapon in the great and 
eternal struggle for existence, a weapon to which everyone must yield, not 
because it is a mere formal mechanism, but because it is the main expression of 
our common will to exist. 


Therefore, in the fight for our new idea, which conforms completely to 
the primal meaning of life, we shall find only a small number of comrades ina 
social order which has become decrepit not only physically, but mentally. 


From these circles only a few exceptional people will join our ranks, 
only those few old people whose hearts have remained young and whose 
courage 1s still vigorous, but not those who consider it their duty to maintain 
the status quo. 


Against us we have the innumerable army of all those who are lazy- 
minded and indifferent rather than evil, and those whose self-interest leads 
them to uphold the present state of affairs. 


In the apparent hopelessness of our great struggle lie the magnitude of 
our task and the possibilities of success. A battle-cry, which from the very start 
will scare off all the petty spirits, or at least discourage them, will become a 
rallying signal for all those that are of the real fighting mettle. Moreover, it 
must be clearly recognised that if a highly energetic and active body of men 


447 


emerges from a nation and unites in the fight for one goal, thereby ultimately 
rising above the inert masses of the people, this small percentage will become 
masters of the whole. 


World history is made by minorities, if these numerical minorities 
possess in themselves the will, energy and initiative of the majority. 


What seems an obstacle to many persons is really a preliminary 
condition of our victory. Just because our task is so great and because so many 
difficulties have to be overcome, the probability is that only the best kind of 
protagonist will join our ranks. 


This selection is the guarantee of our success. Nature generally takes 
certain measures to correct the effect which racial inter-breeding produces. 
She 1s not much in favour of the mongrel. The earlier products of inter- 
breeding have to suffer bitterly, especially the third, fourth and fifth 
generations. 


Not only are they deprived of the higher qualities that belonged to the 
parents who participated in the first crossing, but they also lack definite will- 


power and vigorous vital energies, owing to the lack of harmony in the quality 
of their blood. 


At all critical moments in which a person of pure racial blood makes 
correct decisions, that is to say, decisions that are coherent and uniform, the 
person of mixed blood will become confused and take half-measures. 


Hence we see that a person of mixed blood 1s not only relatively inferior 
to a person of pure blood, but is also doomed to become extinct more rapidly. 


In innumerable cases where the pure race holds its ground, the mongrel 
breaks down. Therein we see the corrective measures adopted by Nature; she 
restricts the possibilities of procreation, thus impeding the fertility of cross- 
breeds and dooming them to extinction. 


For instance, if an individual member of a race should mingle his blood 
with the member of a superior race, the first result would be a lowering of the 
racial level, and furthermore, the issue of this mixed marriage would be 
weaker than those of the people around them who had maintained their blood 
unadulterated. 


Where no new blood from the superior race enters the racial stream of 


448 


the mongrels, and where these mongrels continue to cross-breed among 
themselves, the latter will either die out because they have insufficient powers 
of resistance, which is Nature’s wise provision, or in the course of many 
thousands of years they will forma new mongrel race in which the original 
elements will become so wholly mixed through this millennial crossing that 
traces of the original elements will be no longer recognizable. 


In this way, a new people would be evolved possessing a certain 
resistance capacity of the herd type; but its, intellectual value and its cultural 
significance would be essentially inferior to those of the superior race 
participating in the original inter-breeding. 


But even in this last case, the mongrel product would succumb in the 
mutual struggle for existence with a higher racial group that had maintained its 
blood unmixed. 


The herd solidarity which this mongrel race had developed in the course 
of thousands of years would not be equal to the struggle, and this is because it 
would lack elasticity and constructive capacity to prevail over a race of 
homogeneous blood that was mentally and culturally superior. 


Hence, we may lay down the following principle as well-founded. Every 
racial mixture leads of necessity sooner or later to the downfall of the mongrel 
product, as long as a section of the superior race participating in the cross- 
breeding remains intact and preserves some sort of racial homogeneity. 


The threat to the mongrels ceases only with the bastardization of the last 
members of the superior race who are of unmixed blood. 


This principle is the source of a slow but constant regeneration whereby 
all the poison which has invaded the racial body is gradually eliminated as 
long as there remains a fundamental stock of pure racial elements and there is 
no further inter-breeding. 


Such a process may set in automatically among those people where a 
strong racial instinct has remained. Among such people we may count those 
elements which, for some particular cause such as coercion, have been thrown 
out of the normal way of reproduction along strict racial lines. 


As soon as this compulsion ceases, that part of the race which has 
remained intact will tend to marry with its own kind and thus impede further 
intermingling. 


449 


Then the mongrels recede quite naturally into the background unless their 
numbers have increased so much as to be able to withstand all serious 
resistance from those elements which have preserved the purity of their race. 


When men have lost their natural instincts and ignore the obligations 
imposed on them by Nature, then there is no hope that Nature will repair the 
damage that has been caused, until recognition of their own obligations has 
replaced their lost instincts. 


Then the task of making good what has been lost will have to be 
accomplished by Nature. But there is a serious danger that those who have 
once become blind in this respect will continue more aid more to break down 
racial barriers and finally lose the last remnants of what is best in them. 


What then remains is nothing but a uniform pulpy mass, which seems to 
be the dream of our fine Utopians, but that pulpy mass would soon banish all 
ideals from the world. Certainly a great herd could thus be formed. 


One can breed a herd of animals, but from a mixture of this kind, men 
such as have created and founded civilisations would not be produced. The 
mission of humanity might then be considered at an end. 


Those who do not wish that the earth should fall into such a condition 
must realise that it is the task of the Germanic States in particular to see to it 
that the process of bastardization is brought to a stop. 


Our contemporary generation of weaklings will naturally decry sucha 
policy and whine and complain about it as an encroachment on the most sacred 
of human rights. 


But there is only one right that 1s sacrosanct and that right is at the same 
time a most sacred duty, namely, to protect racial purity so that the best types of 
human beings may be preserved and thus render possible a more noble 
development of humanity itself. 


A volkisch State ought, in the first place, to raise matrimony above the 
level of continual racial adulteration. The State should consecrate it as an 
institution for the procreation of creatures made in the likeness of God Himself 
and not of monsters that are a mixture of man and ape. 


The protest which is put forward in the name of humanity does not befit 
the mouth of a generation that makes it possible for the most depraved 


450 


degenerates to propagate their kind, thereby imposing unspeakable suffering on 
their own products and on their contemporaries, while, on the other hand, 
contraceptives, are permitted and sold in every drug store and even by street 
hawkers, so that babies should not be born to the healthiest of our people. 


In this present State of ours, whose function it is to be the guardian of 
law and order, our national bourgeoisie looks upon it as a crime to make 
procreation impossible for syphilitics and those who suffer from tuberculosis 
or hereditary diseases, and also for cripples and imbeciles. 


But the practical prevention of procreation among millions of our very 
best people is not considered an evil, nor does it offend against the moral code 
of this hypocritical class, but rather suits their short-sightedness and mental 
lethargy, for otherwise they would have to rack their brains to find an answer 
to the question of how to create conditions for the feeding and maintaining of 
those yet unborn beings who will be the healthy representatives of our nation 
and will, in their turn, have to perform the same task for the generation that is 
to follow them. 


How devoid of ideals and how ignoble is the whole contemporary 
system! No effort is being made to perfect the breed for the future, but things 
are simply allowed to slide. 


The fact that the churches join in condoning this sin against the image of 
God, even though they continue to emphasise the dignity of that image, 1s quite 
in keeping with their present activities. 


They talk about the Spirit, but they allow man, as the embodiment of the 
Spirit, to degenerate to the proletarian level. Then they gape with amazement 
when they realise how small is the influence of the Christian Faith in their own 
country and how depraved and ungodly 1s this riff-raff which is physically 
degenerate and therefore morally degenerate also. To balance this state of 
affairs they try to convert the Hottentots, the Zulus and the Kaffirs and to 
bestow on them the blessings of the Church. 


While our European people, God be praised and thanked, are left to 
become the victims of moral depravity, the pious missionary goes out to 
Central Africa and establishes mission-stations for Negroes. 


Finally, sound and healthy though primitive and backward people will be 
transformed, in the name of our ‘higher civilisation,’ into a motley of lazy and 


451 


brutalized mongrels. 


It would better accord with noble human aspirations if our two Christian 
denominations would cease to bother the Negroes with their preaching, which 
the Negroes do not want and do not understand. 


It would be better if they left this work alone and if, in its stead, they 
tried to teach people in Europe, kindly and seriously, that it is much more 
pleasing to God if a couple that is not of healthy stock were to show loving- 
kindness to some poor orphan and become a father and mother to him, rather 
than give life to a sickly child that will be a cause of suffering and unhappiness 
to all. 


In this field the volkisch State will have to repair the damage that has 
been caused by the fact that the problem 1s at present neglected by all the 
various parties concerned. 


It will be the task of the volkisch State to make the race the nucleus of the 
life of the community. It must make sure that the purity of the racial strain will 
be preserved. 


It must proclaim the truth that the child is the most valuable possession a 
nation can have. 


It must see to it that only those who are healthy beget children; that there 
is only one infamy, namely, for parents that are ill or show hereditary defects to 
bring children into the world and that in such cases it is a matter of honour to 
refrain from doing so. 


But, on the other hand, it must be considered as reprehensible to refrain 
from giving healthy children to the nation. 


In this matter, the State must assert itself as the trustee of a millennial 
future, in the face of which the egotistic desires of the individual count for 
nothing and will have to give way before the ruling of the State. 


In order to fulfil this duty in a practical manner the State will have to 
avail itself of modem medical discoveries. It must proclaim as unfit for 
procreation all those who are afflicted with some identifiable hereditary 
disease or are the carriers of it, and practical measures must be adopted to 
have such people rendered sterile. 


452 


On the other hand, provision must be made for the normally fertile 
woman so that she will not be restricted in child-bearing through the financial 
and economic conditions obtaining under a regime which makes the having of 
children a curse to parents. 


The State will have to abolish the cowardly and even criminal 
indifference with which the problem of social amenities for large families is 
treated, and it will have to be the supreme protector of this greatest blessing of 
which a people can boast. 


Its attention and care must be directed towards the child rather than the 
adult. 


Those who are physically or mentally unhealthy and unfit must not 
perpetuate their own suffering in the bodies of their children. 


From the educational point of view there is here a huge task for the 
volkisch State to accomplish, but in a future era this work will appear greater 
and more significant than the victorious wars of our present bourgeois epoch. 


Through education the State must teach individuals that illness is not a 
disgrace, but an unfortunate accident which is to be pitied, yet that it is a crime 
and a disgrace to make this affliction worse by passing on disease and defects 
to innocent creatures, out of mere egotism. 


The State must also teach the people that it is an expression of a really 
noble nature and that it is a humanitarian act worthy of admiration if a person 
who innocently suffers from hereditary disease refrains from having a child of 
his own, but gives his love and affection to some unknown child who, through 
its health, promises to become a healthy member of a healthy community. 


In accomplishing such an educational task the State integrates its 
practical function by this activity in the moral sphere. It must act on this 
principle without paying any attention to the question of whether its conduct 
will be understood or misconstrued, blamed or praised. 


If, throughout a period of not more than six hundred years, all physically 
degenerate or mentally defective persons were sterilized, humanity would not 
only be delivered from an immense misfortune, but also restored to a state of 
general health such as we at present can hardly imagine. 


If the fecundity of the healthy portion of the nation were encouraged ina 


453 


conscientious and methodical way, we should have at least the beginnings of a 
race from which all those germs would be eliminated which are to-day the 
cause of our moral and physical decadence, 


If a people and a State take this course to develop that nucleus of the 
nation which is most valuable from the racial standpoint and thus increase its 
fecundity, the people as a whole will subsequently enjoy the blessings which 
go with pure breeding. 


To achieve this, the State should first of all not leave the colonisation of 
newly acquired territory to a haphazard policy, but should have it carried out 
in accordance with definite principles. 


Specially competent committees ought to issue certificates to individuals 
entitling them to engage in colonisation work, and these certificates should 
guarantee the racial purity of the individuals in question. 


In this way frontier colonies could gradually be founded whose 
inhabitants would be of the purest racial stock, and hence would possess the 
best qualities of the race. 


Such colonies would be a valuable asset to the whole nation. Their 
development would be a source of joy, confidence and pride to each citizen of 
the nation, because they would contain the nucleus which would ultimately 
bring about a great development of the nation and indeed of mankind itself. 


The Weltanschauung which bases the State on the racial idea must 
finally succeed in bringing about a nobler era, in which men will no longer pay 
exclusive attention to breeding and rearing pedigree dogs, horses and cats, but 
will endeavour to improve the breed of the human race itself, 


That will be an era of self-restraint and renunciation for one class of 
people, while the others will give their gifts and make their sacrifices joyfully. 


That such a mentality may be possible cannot be denied in a world 
where hundreds and thousands accept the principle of celibacy of their own 
free will, without being obliged or pledged to do so by anything except an 
ecclesiastical precept. 


Why should it not be possible to induce people to make this sacrifice 1f, 
instead of such a precept, they were simply told that they ought to put an end to 
the original sin of racial corruption which ts steadily being committed from 


454 


one generation to another. Further, they ought to be made to realise that it 1s 
their bounden duty to give to the Almighty Creator beings such as He Himself 
made in His own image. 


Naturally, our wretched army of contemporary Philistines will not 
understand these things. They will ridicule them or shrug their round shoulders 
and groan out their everlasting excuses, “Of course, it is a fine thing, but the 
pity is that it cannot be carried out.” 


And we reply, “With you indeed it cannot be done, for your world 1s 
incapable of such an idea. You know only one anxiety and that is for your own 
personal existence. You have but one God, and that is your money. 


“We do not turn to you, however, for help, but to the great army of those 
who are too poor to consider their personal existence as the highest good on 
earth. They do not place their trust in money, but in other gods, into whose 
hands they confide their lives. 


“Above all we turn to the vast army of our German youth. They are 
coming to maturity in a great epoch, and they will fight against the evils which 
were the outcome of the laziness and indifference of their fathers.” 


Either the German youth will one day create a new State founded on the 
racial idea or they will be the last witnesses of the complete breakdown and 
death of the bourgeois world. Ifa generation suffers from defects which it 
recognises and even admits and is nevertheless quite pleased with itself, as the 
bourgeois world is to-day, resorting to the cheap excuse that nothing can be 
done to remedy the situation, then such a generation is doomed to disaster. 


A marked characteristic of our bourgeois world is that it can no longer 
deny the evil conditions that exist. It has to admit that there is much which is 
foul and wrong; but it is unable to make up its mind to fight against that evil, 
which would mean putting forth the energy to mobilise the forces of sixty or 
seventy million people and thus oppose the menace. 


The bourgeois classes do just the opposite. When such an effort is made 
elsewhere they only indulge in silly comment and try froma safe distance to 
show that such an enterprise is theoretically impossible and doomed to failure. 


No arguments are too stupid to be employed in defence of their own 
pettifogging opinions and their moral attitude. If, for instance, a whole 
continent wages war against alcoholic poisoning, so as to free an entire people 


455 


from this devastating vice, the only reaction of our European bourgeois is to 
gape, shake his head and ridicule the movement with a superior sneer—a state 
of mind which is particularly effective in a society that is so ridiculous. 


But if all this proves of no avail and in some corner of the world the 
time-honoured, inviolable routine is attacked, and attacked to some effect, then 
as has been said, at least the effect must be belittled, even if bourgeois moral 
principles have to be invoked against a movement, the object of which is to 
suppress a great moral evil. 


We must not permit ourselves any illusions on this point. The 
contemporary bourgeois world has become unfit to perform any such noble 
task for the sake of humanity, simply because it is of inferior quality and at the 
same time evil, not so much because it is bent on evil, but because of an all- 
pervading indolence and its consequences. 


That is why those political societies which call themselves bourgeois 
parties are nothing but associations to promote the interests of certain 
professional groups and classes: Their highest aim is to defend their own 
egotistic interests as best they can. 


It is obvious that such a guild, consisting of bourgeois politicians, may 
be considered fit for anything rather than a struggle, especially when the 
adversaries are not cautious shopkeepers but the proletarian masses, goaded to 
extremity and out to win at any cost. 


If we consider it the first duty of the State to serve and promote the 
general welfare of the people, by preserving and encouraging the development 
of the best racial elements, the logical consequence is that this task cannot be 
limited to measures concerning the birth of the infant members of the race and 
nation, but that the State will also have to adopt educational means for making 
each citizen a worthy factor in the further propagation of the race. 


Just as, in general, racial quality is the preliminary condition for the 
mental efficiency of any given human material, the training, of the individual 
will first of all have to be directed towards the development of sound bodily 
health, for the general rule is that a strong and healthy mind is found only ina 
strong and healthy body. 


The fact that men of genius are sometimes not robust in health and 
stature, and are even of a sickly constitution, is no proof of the falsity of the 


456 


principle I have enunciated. 


These cases are only exceptions which, as everywhere else, prove the 
rule. But when the bulk of a nation is composed of physical degenerates it is 
rare for a great man to arise from such a miserable motley, and in any case his 
activities would never meet with great success. 


A degenerate mob will either be incapable of understanding him at all or 
their will-power will be so feeble that they cannot follow the soaring flight of 
such an eagle. 


The State that is grounded on the racial principle and is alive to the 
significance of this truth will first of all have to base its educational work not 
on the mere imparting of knowledge, but rather on physical training and the 
development of healthy bodies. 


The cultivation of the intellectual faculties occupies only second place, 
and here again it is character which has to be developed first of all, namely, 
strength of will and the ability to make decisions. 


The educational system ought to foster a spirit of readiness to accept 
responsibilities gladly. Formal instruction in the sciences must be considered 
last in importance. 


Accordingly, the State which is grounded on the racial idea must start 
with the principle that a person whose formal education in the sciences is 
relatively small, but who is physically sound and robust, of a steadfast and 
honest character, ready and able to make decisions and endowed with strength 
of will, is a more useful member of the national community than a weakling 
who is scholarly and refined. 


A nation composed of learned men who are physically degenerate, or 
weak-willed and timid pacifists, is not capable of ensuring even its own 
existence on this earth. 


In the bitter struggle which decides the destiny of man, it is very rare that 
an individual has succumbed because he lacked learning. Those who fail are 
they who try to ignore these consequences and are too faint-hearted to put them 
into effect. 


There must be a certain balance between mind and body. A degenerate 
body is not more beautiful because it houses a radiant spirit. 


457 


We should not be acting justly if we were to bestow the highest 
intellectual training on those who are physically deformed and crippled, who 
lack decision and are weak-willed and cowardly. 


What has made the Greek ideal of beauty immortal is the wonderful 
union of splendid physical beauty with nobility of mind and spirit. 


Moltke’s saying, that, in the long run, fortune favours only the efficient, 
certainly holds good for the relationship between body and spirit. 


A mind which 1s sound generally dwells in a body that is sound. 


Accordingly, in the volkisch State physical training is not a matter for the 
individual alone, nor is it a duty which first devolves on the parents and is only 
secondarily a matter of public interest. 


It is necessary for the preservation of the people, who are represented 
and protected by the State. 


As regards purely formal education the State even now interferes with 
the individual’s right of self-determination and insists upon the right of the 
community by subjecting the child to an obligatory system of training, without 
regard to the views of the parents. 


In a similar way and to a higher degree the new volkisch State will one 
day make its authority prevail, over the ignorance and incomprehension of 
individuals in problems appertaining to the safety of the nation. 


It must organise its educational work in such a way that the bodies of the 
young will lie systematically trained from infancy onwards, so as to be 
tempered and hardened for the demands to be made on them in later years. 
Above all, the State must see to it that a generation of book-worms 1s not 
developed. 


The work of education and hygiene has to begin with the young mother. 
Painstaking efforts carried on for several decades have succeeded in 
abolishing septic infection in childbirth and in reducing puerperal fever to a 
relatively small number of cases. 


It ought to be possible to give nurses and mothers a thorough course of 
instruction and to institute a system of training the child from early infancy 
onwards which may serve as an excellent basis for its future development. 


458 


The volkisch State ought to allow much more time for physical training 
in schools. 


It is nonsense to burden young brains with a load of material of which, as 
experience shows, they retain only a small part, and mostly not the essentials, 
but only what is of secondary importance, because the young mind 1s incapable 
of sifting the right kind of learning from among all that 1s crammed into it. 


To-day, even in the curriculum of the high schools, only two short hours 
in the week are reserved for gymnastics; and, worse still, it is left to the pupils 
to decide whether or not they want to take part. 


This shows a grave disproportion between this branch of education and 
purely intellectual instruction. Not a single day should be allowed to pass on 
which the young pupil does not have one hour of physical training in the 
morning and one in the evening, and every sort of sport and gymnastics should 
be included. 


There is one kind of sport which should be especially encouraged, 
although many people who call themselves volkisch consider it brutal and 
vulgar, namely, boxing. It is incredible how many false notions prevail among 
the ‘cultured’ classes. 


The fact that the young man learns, how to fence and then spends his time 
in duelling is considered quite natural and respectable. But boxing—that is 
brutal! Why? There is no other sport which equals this in developing the 
militant spirit, none that demands such a power of rapid decision or gives the 
body the flexibility of fine steel. 


It is no more vulgar for two young people to settle their differences with 
their fists rather than with sharp-pointed pieces of steel. 


One who is attacked and defends himself with his fists surely does not 
act in less manly a fashion than one who runs off and yells for the assistance of 
a policeman. 


But, above all, a healthy youth has to learn to endure hard knocks. This 
principle may appear savage to our contemporary champions who fight only 
with the weapons of the intellect, but it is not the purpose of the vo/kisch State 
to raise a colony of aesthetic pacifists and physical degenerates. 


This State does not consider that the human ideal is to be found in the 


459 


honourable Philistine or the maidenly spinster, but in a bold prototype of manly 
virtues and in women capable of bringing men into the world. 


Generally speaking, the function of sport is not only to make the 
individual strong, alert and daring, but also to harden the body and train it to 
endure adverse conditions. 


If our intellectual upper classes had not been trained exclusively in the 
art of gentlemanly behaviour and if, on the contrary, they had learned boxing, it 
would never have been possible for bullies, deserters and other such canaille 
to carry through a German revolution. For the success of this revolution was 
not due to the courageous, energetic and audacious activities of its authors, but 
to the lamentable cowardice and irresolution of those who ruled the German 
State at that time and were responsible for it. 


Our educated leaders had received only an ‘intellectual’ training and 
therefore found themselves defenceless when their adversaries used crowbars 
instead of intellectual weapons. 


All this could happen only because our superior scholastic system did 
not train men to be real men, but merely to be civil servants, engineers, 
technicians, chemists, litterateurs, jurists and, finally, professors, lest 
intellectualism die out. Our leaders in the purely intellectual sphere have 
always been brilliant, but when it came to taking resolute action in practical 
affairs our leaders have been beneath criticism. 


Of course, education cannot make a courageous man out of one who is 
temperamentally a coward, but a man who naturally possesses a certain degree 
of courage will not be able to develop that quality if his defective education 
has made him inferior to others from the very start as regards physical strength 
and prowess. 


The Army offers the best example of the fact that the knowledge of his 
physical ability develops a man’s courage and militant spirit. Outstanding 
heroes were not the rule in the Army, but men of average courage. 


The excellent schooling which the German soldier received before the 
War imbued the members of the whole gigantic organism with a degree of 
confidence in their own superiority such as even our opponents never thought 
possible. 


All the immortal examples of dauntless courage and daring which the 


460 


German armies gave during the late summer and autumn of 1914, as they 
advanced from triumph to triumph, were the result of that training which had 
been pursued systematically. 


During the long years of peace before the last war men who were almost 
physical weaklings were made capable of incredible deeds, and thus a self- 
confidence was developed which did not fail them even in the most terrible 
battles. It is our German people, which is now ina state of collapse and 
helpless to defend itself against the kicks dealt it by the rest of the world, that 
has need of the power that is the outcome of self-confidence. 


But this confidence in oneself must be instilled into our children from 
their very early years. The whole system of education and training must be 
directed towards fostering in the child the conviction that he is unquestionably 
a match for anybody and everybody. 


The individual has to regain his own physical strength and prowess in 
order to believe in the invincibility of the nation to which he belongs. 


What has formerly led the German armies to victory was the sum total of 
the confidence which each individual had in himself, and which all of them had 
in their leaders. 


What will restore the national strength of the German people is the 
conviction that they will be able to regain their liberty, but this conviction can 
only be the final product of this same feeling in millions of individuals. 


And here again we must have no illusions. The collapse of our people 
was overwhelming, and the efforts who put an end to so much misery must be 
superhuman. It would be a bitter and grave error to believe that our people 
could be made strong again simply by means of our present bourgeois training 
in good order and obedience. 


That will not suffice if we are to break up the present order of things, 
which now sanctions the acknowledgment of our defeat, and cast the broken 
chains of our slavery in the faces of our opponents. 


Only by a superabundance of national energy and a passionate this it for 
liberty can we recover what has been lost. 


Again, the manner of clothing the young should be such as harmonises 
with this purpose. It is really lamentable to see how our young people have 


461 


fallen victims to a fashion mania which perverts the meaning of the old adage 
that clothes make the man. 


Especially in regard to young people, clothes should have their place in 
educational training. The boy who walks about in summer-time wearing long 
baggy trousers and clad up to the neck is hampered by his clothes from feeling 
any inclination towards strenuous physical exercise. 


Ambition and, to speak quite frankly, even vanity must be appealed to. I 
do not mean such vanity as leads people to want to wear fine clothes, which 
not everybody can afford, but rather the vanity which makes a person want to 
develop a fine physique which everybody can try to do. 


This is also of value in later years. The young girl must get to know her 
mate. If the beauty of the body were not completely forced into the background 
to-day through our stupid manner of dressing, it would not be possible for 
thousands of our girls to be led astray by Jewish mongrels, with their repulsive 
crooked waddle. 


It is also in the interests of the nation that those of beautiful physique 
should mate in order that they may play their part in providing the nation with 
fresh beauty. 


Since we have at present no form of military training and since, 
consequently, the only institution which, in peacetime at least, partly made up 
for the lack of physical training in our education is now lacking, what I have 
suggested is all the more necessary in our time. 


The success of our old military training not only showed itself in the 
education of the individual, but also in the influence which it exercised over 
the mutual relationship between the sexes. The young girl preferred the soldier 
to one who was not a soldier. 


The volkisch State must not confine its control of physical training to the 
official school period, but must demand that, after leaving school, and while 
his adolescent body is still developing, the boy continues this training, for on 
such proper physical development, success in after-life largely depends. 


It is stupid to think that the right of the State to supervise the education of 
its young citizens suddenly comes to an end the moment they leave school and 
recommences only with military service. 


462 


This right is a duty, and as such it must continue uninterruptedly. The 
present State, which does not interest itself in developing healthy men, has 
criminally neglected its duty. It leaves our contemporary youth to be, corrupted 
on the streets and in the brothels, instead of keeping hold of the reins and 
continuing the physical training of these young people up to the time when they 
are grown into healthy young men and women. 


For the present, it is a matter of indifference what form the State chooses 
for carrying on this training. The essential thing is that it should be developed 
and that the most suitable ways of doing so should be investigated. 


The volkisch State will have to consider the physical training of the 
youth after the school period just as much a public duty as his intellectual 
training, and this training will have to be carried out through public 
institutions. 

On general lines it can be a preparation for subsequent service in the 
Army, and then it will no longer be the task of the Army to teach the young 
recruit the most elementary drill regulations. 


In fact, the Army will no longer have to deal with recruits in the present 
sense of the word, but will rather have to transform into a soldier the youth 
whose bodily prowess has already been fully developed. 


In the volkisch State the Army will no longer be obliged to teach boys 
how to walk and stand erect, but it will be the final and supreme school of 
patriotic education. 


In the Army the young recruit will learn the art of bearing arms and .at 
the same time he will be equipped for his other duties in later life. 


The supreme aim of military education must always be to achieve that 
which was attributed to the old Army as its highest merit, namely, that through 
his military schooling the boy must be transformed into a man, that he must not 
only learn to obey, but also acquire the fundamentals that will enable him one 
day to command. He must learn to remain silent, not only when he is justly 
rebuked, but also when he 1s unjustly rebuked. 


Furthermore, in the consciousness of his own strength and on the basis of 
that esprit de corps which inspires him and his comrades, he must become 
convinced that he belongs to a nation which is invincible. 


463 


After he has completed his military training two certificates shall be 
handed to the soldier. The one will be his diploma as a citizen of the State, a 
juridical document which will enable him to take part in public affairs. 


The second will be an attestation of his physical health, which 
guarantees his fitness for marriage. 


The volkisch State will have to direct the education of girls just as that 
of boys and according to the same fundamental principles. 


Here again, special importance must be assigned to physical training, 
and only after that must the importance of spiritual and mental training be taken 
into account. 


In the education of the girl the final goal always to be kept in mind is that 
she is one day to be a mother. 


In the second place, the volkisch State must busy itself with the all-round 
training of character. 


Of course, the essential traits of the individual character are already 
there before any education takes place. 


A person who 1s fundamentally egotistic will always remain 
fundamentally egotistic, and the idealist will always remain fundamentally an 
idealist. 


Besides those, however, who already possess a definite stamp of 
character there are millions of people with characters that are indefinite and 


vague. 


The born delinquent will always remain a delinquent, but numerous 
people who show only a certain tendency to commit criminal acts may become 
useful members of the community if rightly trained; whereas, on the other hand, 
weak and unstable characters may easily become evil elements if the system of 
education is bad. 


During the War it was often lamented that our people could be so little 
reticent. This failing made it very difficult to keep even highly important 
secrets from the knowledge of the enemy. 


But let us put the question: What did the German educational system do 
in pre-war times to teach Germans to be discreet? 


464 


Did it not very often happen in school-days that the little tell-tale was 
preferred to his companions who kept their mouths shut? 


Is it not true that then, as well as now, complaining about others was 
considered praiseworthy ‘candour,’ while silent discretion was taken as 
obstinacy? 


Has any attempt ever been made to teach the young that discretion is a 
precious and manly virtue? No, for such matters are trifles in the eyes of our 
education authorities. 


But these trifles cost our State innumerable millions in legal expenses, 
for ninety per cent of all the processes for defamation and similar charges arise 
only from a lack of discretion. 


Remarks that are made without any sense of responsibility are 
thoughtlessly repeated from mouth to mouth, and our economic welfare is 
continually damaged because important methods of production are carelessly 
disclosed. 


Secret preparations for our national defence are rendered illusory 
because our people have never learned the duty of silence. They repeat 
everything they happen to hear. In time of war such talkative habits may even 
cause the loss of battles and may therefore contribute essentially for the 
unsuccessful outcome of a campaign. 


Here, as in other matters, we may rest assured that adults cannot do what 
they have not learnt to do in youth. A teacher must not try to discover the wild 
tricks of the boys by encouraging the evil practice of tale-bearing. 


Young people form a sort of state among themselves and face adults with 
a certain solidarity. That is quite natural. The ties which unite the ten-year-old 
boys to one another are stronger and more natural than their relationship to 
adults. 


A boy who tells on his comrades commits an act of treason and shows a 
bent of character which is, to speak bluntly, similar to that of a man who 
commit; high treason. 


Such a boy must not be classed as ‘good,’ ‘reliable,’ and so on, but rather 
as one with undesirable traits of character. It may be rather convenient for the 
teacher to make use of such unworthy tendencies in order to help him in his 


465 


own work, but by such an attitude the germ of a moral habit is sown in young 
hearts and may one day have fatal consequences. 


It has happened more often than once that a young informer developed 
into a scoundrel. 


This is only one example among many. The deliberate training of fine 
and noble traits of character in our schools to-day is almost negative. 


In the future much more emphasis will have to be laid on this side of our 
educational work. Loyalty, self-sacrifice, and discretion are virtues which a 
great nation must possess, and the teaching and development of these in the 
schools is a more important matter than many other things now included in the 
curriculum. 


To make the children give up habits of complaining, whining and 
howling when they are hurt, etc., also belongs to this part of their training. 


If the educational system fails to teach the child at an early age to endure 
pain and injury without complaining we cannot be surprised, if at a later age, 
when the boy has grown to manhood and is, for example, in the trenches, the 
postal service is used for nothing but to send home letters full of grumbles and 
complaints. 


If our youths, during their years in the primary schools, had had their 
minds crammed with a little less knowledge and if, instead, they had been 
better taught how to be masters of themselves, it would have served us well 
during the years 1915-1918. 


In its educational system the volkisch State will have to attach the highest 
importance to the development of character, hand-in-hand with physical 
training. 


Many more defects which our rational organism betrays at present could 
be ameliorated, if not completely eliminated, by education of the right kind. 


Extreme importance should be attached to the training of will-power and 
young people should be trained to make firm decisions and to accept 
responsibility. 


In the training of our old Army the principle was in vogue that any order 
is always better than no order. Applied to our youth this principle ought to take 


466 


the form that any answer is better than no answer. The fear of replying, because 
one fears to be wrong, ought to be considered more humiliating than giving 
thee wrong reply. On this simple and primitive basis, our youth should be 
trained to have the courage to act. 


It has been often lamented that in November and December 1918 all the 
authorities lost their heads and that, from the monarch down to the last 
divisional commander, nobody had sufficient mettle to make a decision on his 
own responsibility. 


That terrible fact constitutes a grave charge against our educational 
system, because what was revealed ona colossal scale in that moment of 
catastrophe was only what happens on a smaller scale everywhere among us. 


It is the lack of will-power, and not the lack of arms, which renders us 
incapable of offering any serious resistance today. 


This defect is found everywhere among our people and prevents 
decisive action wherever risks have to be taken, as if any great action can be 
taken without involving risk. 


Quite unsuspectingly, a German general found a formula for this 
lamentable lack of the will-to-act when he said, “I act only when I can count on 
a fifty-one per cent chance of success.” 


In that ‘fifty-one per cent chance’ we find the very key to the German 
collapse. The man who demands from Fate a guarantee of his success 
deliberately denies the significance of heroic action, for this significance 
consists in the very fact that, in the definite knowledge that the situation in 
question is fraught with mortal danger, an action is undertaken which may lead 
to success. 


A patient suffering from cancer, who knows that his death is certain if he 
does not undergo an operation, needs no assurance of a fifty-one per cent 
chance of a cure before facing the operation, and if the operation promise only 
a fraction of a one per cent probability of success; a man of courage would risk 
it and he who does not take the risk has no right to whine. 


Taking all in all, cowardly lack of will-power and inability to form 
resolutions are mainly the outcome of the fundamentally wrong training which 
our young people receive. 


467 


The disastrous effects become evident in later life and reach their peak 
in the lack of civilian courage which our leading statesmen display. 


The cowardice which leads nowadays to the shirking of every kind of 
responsibility springs from the same source. Here again it is the fault of the 
education given to our young people. 


This drawback permeates all sections of public life and finds its 
consummation in the institutions of government that function under the 
parliamentary regime. 


Even in the schools, unfortunately, more value is attached to ‘confession 
and full repentance’ and ‘contrite abjuration,’ on the part of little sinners than to 
a simple and frank avowal. But this latter seems to-day, in the eyes of many a 
teacher, to savour of a spirit of utter incorrigibility and depravity, and, though 
it may seem incredible, many a boy 1s told that the gallows is waiting for him, 
because he has shown certain traits which might be of inestimable value to the 
nation its a whole. 


Just as the volkisch State must one day give its attention to training the 
will-power and capacity for decision among the youth, so too it must cultivate 
in the hearts of the younger generation from early childhood onwards a 
readiness to accept responsibility, and the courage to make open and frank 
avowal. 


If it recognises the full significance of this necessity, finally—after a 
century of educative work—it will succeed in building up a nation which will 
no longer be subject to those defects that have contributed so disastrously to 
bring about our present overthrow. 


The formal imparting of knowledge, which constitutes the chief work of 
our educational system to-day, will be taken over by the vélkisch State with 
only few modifications. These modifications must be made in three branches. 


First of all, the brains of young people must not be generally burdened 
with subjects of which ninety-five per cent is useless to them and 1s therefore 
forgotten again. 


The curriculum of the primary and central schools presents an odd 
mixture at the present time. In many branches of study the subject matter to be 
learned has become so enormous that only a very small fraction of it can be 
remembered later on, and indeed only a very small fraction of this whole mass 


468 


of knowledge can be used. 


On the other hand, what is learned is insufficient for anybody who 
wishes to specialise in any certain branch for the purpose of earning his daily 
bread. 


Take, for example, the average civil servant who has passed through the 
Gymnasium or High School, and ask him, at the age of thirty or forty, how much 
he has retained of the knowledge that was crammed into him with so much 
pains. 


How much is retained of all that was stuffed into his brain? He will 
certainly answer, “Well, the sole purpose of all I swotted up in those days was 
not to provide me with a great stock of knowledge from which I could draw in 
later years; but it served to develop the understanding, the memory, and above 
all it helped to strengthen the thinking power of the brain.” 


That is partly true. And yet it is somewhat dangerous to submerge a 
young brain in a flood of impressions, which it can hardly master and the 
single elements of which it cannot discern or appreciate at their true value. 


It is mostly the essential part of this knowledge, and not the incidental, 
that 1s forgotten and sacrificed. 


Thus the principal purpose of this copious instruction is frustrated, for 
that purpose cannot be to make the brain capable of learning by simply offering 
it an enormous and varied amount of subjects for acquisition, but rather to 
furnish the individual with that stock of knowledge, which he will need in later 
life and which he can use for the good of the community. 


This aim, however, is rendered illusory if, because of the 
superabundance of subjects that have been crammed into his head in childhood, 
a person is able to remember nothing, or at least not the essential portion, of all 
this in later life. 


There is no reason why millions of people should learn two or three 
languages during their school years, when only a very small fraction will have 
the opportunity to use these languages in later life and when most of them will 
therefore forget these languages completely. 


To take one instance, out of one hundred thousand students who learn 
French there are probably not two thousand who will be ina position to make 


469 


use of this accomplishment in later life, while ninety-eight thousand will never 
have a chance to utilise in practice what they have learned in youth. 


They have spent thousands of hours on a subject which will afterwards 
be of no value or importance to them. 


The argument that these, subjects form part of a general education 1s 
invalid. It would be sound if all these people were able to use this learning in 
after-life. But, as matters stand, ninety-eight thousand are tortured to no 
purpose and waste valuable time, for the sake of the two thousand to whom the 
language will be of any use. 


In the case of that language which I have chosen as an example it cannot 
be said that the learning of it educates the student in logical thinking or 
sharpens his mental acumen, as the learning of Latin, for instance, might be 
said to do. 


It would, therefore, be much better to teach young students only the 
general outline or, better, the inner structure of such a language, that is to say, to 
allow them to discern the characteristic features of the language, or perhaps to 
make them acquainted with the rudiments of its grammar, its pronunciation, its 
syntax, style, etc. 


That would be sufficient for average students, because it would provide 
a clearer view of the whole and could be more easily remembered and would 
be more practical than the present-day attempt to cram into their heads detailed 
knowledge of the whole language, which they can never master and which they 
will readily forget. 


If this method were adopted, then we should avoid the danger that, out of 
the superabundance of matter taught, only some fragments will remain in the 
memory, for the children would then have to learn what is worth while, and the 
selection between the useful and the useless would thus have been made 
beforehand. 


As regards the majority of students, the knowledge and understanding of 
the rudiments of a language would be quite sufficient for the rest of their lives, 
and those who really do need this language subsequently would thus have a 
foundation on which to build, should they, choose to make a more thorough 
study of it. 


By adopting such a curriculum the necessary amount of time would be 


470 


gained for physical exercises, as well as for a more intense training in the 
various educational fields that have already been mentioned. 


A reform of particular importance is that which ought to take place in the 
present methods of teaching history. Scarcely any other people is made to study 
as much history as the Germans, and scarcely any other people makes such bad 
use of its historical knowledge. 


If politics are history in the making, then our way of teaching history 
stands condemned by the way we have conducted our politics. 


But, there would be no point in bewailing the lamentable results of our 
political conduct, unless we are now determined to give our people a better 
political education. 


In ninety-nine out of one hundred cases the results of our present teaching 
of history are deplorable. Usually only a few dates, years of birth and names, 
remain in the memory, while a knowledge of the main and clearly defined lines 
of historical development is completely lacking. 


The essential features which are of real significance are not taught. It is 
left to the more or less bright intelligence of the individual to discover the 
inner motivating urge amid the mass of dates and chronological succession of 
events. 


You may object as strongly as you like to this unpleasant statement, but 
read with attention the speeches which our parliamentarians make during one 
single session on the problems connected with, let us say, foreign policy. 


Remember that these gentlemen are, or claim to be, the elite of the 
German nation and that at least a great number of them have sat on the benches 
of our secondary schools and that many of them have passed through our 
universities. 


Then you will realise how defective the historical education of these 
men has been. If these gentlemen had never studied history at all, but had 
possessed a sound instinct for public affairs, things would have gone better, 
and the nation would have benefited greatly thereby. 


The subject matter of our history teaching must be curtailed. The chief 
value of that teaching is to make the principal lines of historical development 
understood. The more our historical teaching is limited to this task, the more 


471 


we may hope that it will turn out subsequently to be of advantage to the 
individual and, through the individual, to the community as a whole, for history 
must not be studied merely with a view to knowing what happened in the past, 
but as a guide for the future, and to teach us what policy would be the best to 
follow for the preservation of our own people. 


That is the real end, and the teaching of history is only a means to attain 
this end. But here again the means has superseded the end in our contemporary 
education. The goal is completely forgotten. 


Do not retort that a profound study of history demands a detailed 
knowledge of all these dates because otherwise we could not fix the great lines 
of development. 


That task falls to the professional historians, but the average man is not a 
professor of history. For him history has only one mission, and that is to 
provide him with that amount of historical knowledge which is necessary in 
order to enable him to form an independent opinion on the political affairs of 
his own country. 


The man who wants to become a professor of history can devote himself 
to all the details later on. Naturally he will have to occupy himself even with 
the smallest details. 


Of course our present teaching of history is not adequate to all this, Its 
scope 1s too vast for the average student and too limited for the student who 
wishes to be a historical expert. 


Finally, it is the business of the volkisch State to arrange for the writing 
of a world history in which the racial problem will occupy a dominant 
position. 


To sum up: The vdlkisch State must reconstruct our system of general 
instruction in such a way that it will embrace only what is essential. 


Beyond this it will have to make provision for more advanced teaching 
in the various subjects for those who want to specialise in them. 


It will suffice for the average individual to be acquainted with the 
fundamentals of the various subjects to serve as the basis of what may be 
called an all-round education. 


472 


He ought to study exhaustively and in detail only that subject in which he 
intends to work during the rest of his life. General instruction in all subjects 
should be obligatory, and specialisation should be left to the choice of the 
individual. 


In this way the scholastic programme would be shortened, and thus 
several school hours would be gained which could be utilised for physical 
exercise and character training in will-power, the capacity for making 
practical judgments, decisions, etc. 


The little account taken by our school training to-day, especially in the 
central schools, of the callings that have to be followed in after-life is 
demonstrated by the fact that men who are destined for the same calling in life 
are educated in three different kinds of schools. 


What is of decisive importance is general education and not specialised 
teaching. When special knowledge is needed it cannot be given in the 
curriculum of our central schools as they are to-day. The volkisch State will, 
therefore, one day have to abolish such half-measures. 


The second modification in the curriculum which the vdlkisch State will 
have to make is the following: It is a characteristic of our materialistic epoch 
that our scientific education shows a growing emphasis on what is real and 
practical, on such subjects as, for instance, applied mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, etc. 


Of course, they are necessary in an age that is dominated by industrial 
technology and chemistry, and of which they are, externally at least, a most 
significant factor of everyday life, but it 1s dangerous to base the general 
education of the nation ona knowledge of, these subjects to the exclusion of all 
others. 


General education should, on the contrary, be on cultural lines. It ought to 
be founded more on classical studies and should aim at providing only the 
groundwork for specialised instruction later on in the various practical 
sciences. 


Otherwise we should sacrifice those forces that are more important for 
the preservation of the nation than any technical knowledge. 


In the history department the study of ancient history should not be 
omitted. Roman history, along general lines, 1s, and will remain, the best 


473 


teacher, not only for our own time, but also for the future, and the ideal of 
Hellenic culture should be preserved for us in all its marvellous beauty. 


The differences between the various peoples should not prevent us from 
recognising the community of race which unites them, on a higher plane. 


The conflict of our time is one that is being waged around great 
objectives. A civilisation is fighting for its existence. It is a civilisation that is 
the product of thousands of years of historical development, and the Greek as 
well as the German forms part of it. 


A clear-cut division must be made between general education and 
specialised subjects. Today the latter threaten more and more to become 
debased in the service of Mammon. 


To counterbalance this tendency, general culture should be preserved, at 
least in its ideal forms. The principle should be repeatedly emphasised, that 
industrial and technical progress, trade and commerce, can flourish only as 
long as a folk-community inspired by ideals provides the requisite basis. 


That condition is not created by a spirit of materialistic egotism, but by a 
spirit of self-denial and the joy of giving oneself in the service of others. 


The system of education which obtains to-day sees its principal object in 
cramming into young people that knowledge which wall help them to make 
their way in life. 


This principle is expressed in the following terms, “The young man must 
one day become a useful member of human society.” That phrase refers to his 
ability to gain an honest livelihood. 


The superficial training in the duties of good citizenship, which he 
acquires merely incidentally, has very weak foundations. The State in itself 
represents only a vessel, and therefore it is difficult to train people to look 
upon this vessel as the ideal which they will have to serve and towards which 
they must feel responsible. 


A vessel can be too easily broker. But, as we have seen, people to-day 
have no clear-cut concept of what the term State’ implies. Therefore, there is 
nothing but the usual stereotyped ‘patriotic training. 


In the old Germany this mainly took the form of an adulation (which was 


474 


often rather stupid and usually boring) of petty potentates who were so 
numerous that it became necessary to omit all mention of the really great men 
whom Germany has produced. 


The result was that the broad masses acquired a very inadequate 
knowledge of German history. Here, too, the great lines of development were 
missing. 


It is evident that by such methods no real national enthusiasm could be 
aroused. Our educational system proved incapable of selecting from the 
general mass of our historical personages the names of a few personalities 
which the German people could be proud to look upon as their own. 


Thus the whole nation might have been united by the ties of a common 
knowledge of this common heritage. 


The really important figures in German history were not presented to the 
present generation. The attention of the whole nation was not concentrated on 
them for the purpose of awakening a common national spirit. 


From the various subjects that were taught, those who had charge of our 
training seemed incapable of selecting what redounded most to the national 
honour and of lifting that above the common objective level, in order to 
inflame the national pride in the light of such brilliant examples. 


At that time such a course would have been looked upon as rank 
chauvinism, which did not then have a very pleasant savour. 


Pettifogging dynastic patriotism was more acceptable and more easily 
tolerated than the glowing fire of a supreme national pride. The former could 
always be pressed into service, whereas the latter might one day become a 
dominating force. 


Monarchist patriotism terminated in associations of veterans, whereas 
passionate national patriotism might have opened a road whose goal would 
have been difficult to determine. This national passion is like a thoroughbred 
which will not tolerate any sort of rider in the saddle. 


No wonder that most people preferred to shirk such a danger. Nobody 
seemed to think it possible that one day a war might come which would put the 
mettle of this kind of patriotism to the test, in artillery bombardments and 
waves of attacks with poison gas. 


475 


But when it did come our lack of this patriotic passion was avenged ina 
terrible way. None were very enthusiastic about dying for their imperial and 
royal sovereigns, whilst on the other hand, the ‘nation’ was not recognised by 
the greater number of the soldiers. 


Since the Revolution has taken place in Germany and monarchist 
patriotism has become a thing of the past, the purpose of teaching history has 
merely been to add to the stock of objective knowledge. 


The present State has no use for patriotic enthusiasm, but it will never 
obtain what it really desires, for it dynastic patriotism failed to produce a 
supreme power of resistance at a time when the principle of nationalism 
dominated, it will be still less possible to arouse republican enthusiasm. 


There can be no doubt that the German people would not have stood on 
the field of battle for four and a half years and fought to the battle slogan, ‘For 
the Republic’ least of all those who created this grand institution. 


In reality this Republic has been allowed to exist undisturbed only by 
virtue of its readiness in assuring all and sundry of its willingness to pay 
tribute and reparations to the foreigner and to put its signature to any kind of 
territorial renunciation. 


The rest of the world approves of it, just as a weakling is always more 
pleasing to those who want to bend him to their own will than is a man of 
mettle. But the fact that the enemy like this form of government is the worst 
kind of condemnation. 


They love the German Republic and tolerate its existence because no 
better instrument could be found to help them to keep our people in slavery. It 
is to this fact alone that this magnanimous institution owes its survival. 


That is why it can dispense with, any real system of national education 
and can feel satisfied when the heroes who belong to the Reich Banner 
organisation shout their hurrahs, but in reality these same heroes would 
scamper away like rabbits if called upon to defend that banner with their 
blood. 


The volkisch State will have to fight for its existence. It will neither gain 
nor secure this existence by signing documents like the Dawes Plan, but for its 
existence and defence it will need precisely those things with which our 
present system believes it can dispense. 


476 


The more worthy its form and its inner national character, the greater 
will be the envy and opposition of its adversaries. The best defence will not 
be in the arms it possesses, but in its citizens. 


It is not fortresses that will protect it, but the living wall of its men and 
women, filled with an ardent love for their country and a passionate spirit of 
national patriotism. 


Therefore, the third point which will have to be considered in relation to 
our educational system is the following: The volkisch State must realise that 
the sciences may also be made a means of promoting a spirit of pride in the 
nation. 


Not only the history of the world, but the history of civilisation as a 
whole, must be taught in the light of this principle. An inventor must appear 
great not only as an inventor but also, and even more so, as a member of the 
nation. 


The admiration aroused by the contemplation of a great achievement 
must be, transformed into a feeling of pride and satisfaction that a man of one’s 
own race has been chosen to accomplish it. 


But out of the abundance of great names in German history the greatest 
will have to be selected and presented to our younger generation in such a way 
as to become solid pillars of strength to support the national spirit. 


The subject matter ought to be systematically organised from the 
standpoint of this principle, and the teaching should be so orientated that the 
boy or girl, after leaving school, will not be a semi-pacifist, a democrat or 
something else of that kind, but a whole-hearted German. 


In order that this national feeling be sincere from the very beginning, and 
not a mere pretence, the following fundamental and inflexible principle should 
be impressed on the young brain while it is yet malleable: The man who loves 
his nation can prove the sincerity of this sentiment only by being ready to make 
sacrifices for the nation’s welfare. 


There is no such thing as a national sentiment which is directed towards 
personal interests, and there is no such thing as a nationalism that embraces 
only certain classes. 


Hurrahing proves nothing and does not confer the right to call oneself 


477 


national if behind that shout there is no sincere preoccupation for the 
conservation of the nation’s well-being. 


One can be proud of one’s people only if there is no class left of which 
one need be ashamed. When one half of a nation is sunk in misery and worn cut 
by hardship and distress, or even depraved or degenerate, that nation presents 
such an unattractive picture that nobody can feel proud to belong to it. 


It is only when a nation is sound in all its members, physically and 
morally, that the joy of belonging to it can grow and swell to that supreme 
feeling which we call national pride. 


But this pride, in its highest form, can be felt only by those who know the 
greatness of their nation. 


The spirit of nationalism and a feeling for social justice must be fused 
into one sentiment in the hearts of the youth. Then a day will come when a 
nation of citizens will arise which will be welded together through a common 
love and a common pride that shall be invincible and indestructible for ever. 


The dread of chauvinism, which is a symptom of our time, is a sign of its 
impotence. 


Since our epoch not only lacks everything in the nature of exuberant 
energy, but even finds such a manifestation disagreeable, Fate will never select 
it for the accomplishment of any great deeds. For the greatest changes that have 
taken place on this earth would have been inconceivable if they had not been 
inspired by ardent and even hysterical passions, but only by the bourgeois 
virtues of peacefulness and order. 


One thing is certain, namely, that our world is facing a great revolution. 
The only question is whether the outcome will be propitious for the Aryan 
portion of mankind or whether the everlasting Jew will profit by it. 


By educating the younger generation along the right lines, the volkisch 
State will have to see to it that a generation of men will arise fit to play its part 
in this supreme and final combat that will decide the destiny of the world. 


That nation will conquer which 1s the first to take this road. The whole 
organisation of education and training which the vdlkisch State is to build up 
must regard as its crowning task the work of instilling into the hearts and minds 
of the youth entrusted to it the racial instinct and understanding of the racial 


478 


idea. 


No boy or girl must leave school without having attained a clear insight 
into the meaning of racial purity and the importance of maintaining our racial 
blood unadulterated. 


Thus the first indispensable condition for the preservation of our race 
will have been established and the future cultural progress of our people 
assured, for all physical and mental training would be in vain unless it benefits 
an entity which is ready and determined to carry on its own existence and to 
maintain its own characteristic qualities. 


If it were otherwise, something would result which we Germans have 
cause to regret already, without perhaps having hitherto recognised the extent 
of the tragic calamity. 


Even in future we should be doomed to remain mere manure for 
civilisation, and that not in the banal sense of the contemporary bourgeois 
mind, which sees in a lost fellow-member of our people only a lost citizen, but 
in a sense which we should have to recognise in sorrow, namely, that our, 
racial blood would be destined to disappear. 


By continually mixing with other races we might lift them from their 
former lower level of civilisation to a higher plane, but we ourselves should 
descend for ever from the heights we had reached. 


Finally, from the racial standpoint, this training must also find its 
culmination in military service. The term of military service is to be a final 
stage in the educational training which the average German receives. While the 
volkisch State attaches, the greatest importance to physical and mental training, 
it has also to consider, as no less important, the task of selecting men for the 
service of the state itself. 


This important matter 1s passed over lightly at the present time. 
Generally, the children of parents who are for the time being in higher 
situations are, in their turn, considered worthy of a higher education. 


Here talent plays a subordinate part, but talent can be estimated only 
relatively. Though in general culture he may be inferior to the city child, a 
peasant boy may be more talented than the son of a family that has occupied 
high positions for many generations. 


479 


But the superior culture of the city child has in itself nothing to do witha 
greater or lesser degree of talent, for this culture has its roots in the more 
copious mass of impressions which arise from the more varied education and 
the surroundings among which this child lives. 


If the intelligent son of peasant parents were educated from childhood in 
similar surroundings, his intellectual accomplishments would be quite 
otherwise. 


In our day there is only one sphere where the circumstances in which a 
person has been born mean less than his innate gifts. That is the sphere of art. 
Here, where a person cannot just ‘learn,’ but must have innate gifts that later on 
may undergo a more or less happy development (in the sense of a wise 
development of what is already there), money and parental property are of no 
account. 


This is definite proof that genius 1s not necessarily connected with the 
higher social strata or with wealth. Not rarely the greatest artists come from 
poor families, and many a boy froma country village has eventually become a 
celebrated artist. 


It does not say much for the mental acumen of our time that this truth is 
not recognised and acted upon to the advantage of our whole intellectual life. 


The opinion is advanced that this principle, though undoubtedly valid in 
the field of art, has not the same validity in regard to what are called the 
applied sciences. 


It is true that a man can be trained to a certain amount of mechanical 
dexterity, just as a poodle can be taught incredible tricks by a clever master, 
but such training does not bring the animal to use his intelligence in order to 
carry out those tricks. 


The same holds good in regard to man. It is possible to teach men, 
irrespective of talent, to go through certain scientific exercises, but in such 
cases the results are quite as automatic and mechanical as in the case of the 
animal. 


It would even be possible to force a person of mediocre intelligence, by 
means of an intensive course of intellectual drilling, to acquire more than the 
average amount of knowledge; but that knowledge would remain sterile. 


480 


The result would be a man who might be a walking dictionary of 
knowledge, but who would fail miserably on every critical occasion in life and 
at every juncture where vital decisions had to be taken. 


Such people need to be drilled specially for every new and even most 
insignificant task and will never be capable, of contributing in the least to the 
general progress of mankind. 


Knowledge that is merely drilled into people can at best qualify them to 
fill government positions under our present regime. 


It goes without saying that, among the sum total of individuals who make 
up a nation, gifted people are always to be found in every sphere of life. 


It is also quite natural that the value of knowledge will be the, greater the 
more vitally the dead mass of learning is animated by the innate talent of the 
individual who possesses it. 


Creative work in this field can be done only through the marriage of 
knowledge and talent. 


One example will suffice to show how much our contemporary world is 
at fault in this matter. 


From time to time our illustrated papers publish, for the edification of 
the German Philistine, the news that in some quarter or other of the globe, and 
for the first time in that locality, a Negro has become a lawyer, a teacher, a 
pastor, or even a grand opera singer or something else of that kind. 


While the bourgeois blockhead stares with amazed admiration at the 
paragraph that tells him how marvellous are the achievements of our modern 
educational technique, the more cunning Jew sees in this fact a new proof to be 
utilised for the spreading of the theory with which he wants to infect the public, 
namely, that all men are equal. 


It does not dawn on the murky bourgeois mind that the fact which is 
published for him is a sin against reason itself, that it is an act of criminal 
insanity to train a being who is only an anthropoid by birth until the pretence 
can be made that he has been turned into a lawyer; while, on the other hand, 
millions who belong to the most civilised races have to remain in positions 
which are unworthy of their cultural level. 


481 


The bourgeois mind does not realise that it is a sin against the will of the 
eternal Creator to allow hundreds of thousands of highly gifted people to 
remain floundering in the swamp of proletarian misery, while Hottentots and 
Zulus are drilled to fill positions in the intellectual professions. 


For here we have the product only of a drilling technique, just as in the 
case of the performing dog. If the same amount of care and effort were applied 
among intelligent races, each individual would become a thousand times more 
capable in such matters. This state of affairs would become intolerable ifa day 
should dawn when it is no longer a matter of exceptional cases, but the 
situation is already intolerable where talent and natural gifts are not taken as 
decisive factors in qualifying for the right to a higher education. 


It is indeed intolerable to think that year after year hundreds of thousands 
of young people without a vestige of talent are deemed worthy of a higher 
education, while other hundreds of thousands who possess high natural gifts 
have to go without any sort of higher schooling at all. 


The practical loss thus suffered by the nation is incalculable. If the 
number of important discoveries which have been made in North America, in 
particular, has grown considerably in recent years, one of the reasons is that 
the number of gifted persons belonging to the lowest social classes who were 
given a higher education in that country is proportionately much larger than in 
Europe. 


A stock of knowledge packed into the brain will not suffice for the 
making of discoveries. What counts here is only that knowledge which is 
illuminated by natural talent, but with us at the present time no value is placed 
on such gifts. Only good school reports count. 


Here is another educative work that is waiting for the volkisch State to 
accomplish. It will not be its task to assure a dominant influence to a certain 
social class already existing, but it will be its duty to attract the most 
competent brains in the total mass of the nation and promote them to place and 
honour. 


It is not merely the duty of the State to give to the average child a certain 
amount of education in the primary school, but it is also its duty to make it 
possible for talent to develop, and above all, it must open the doors of the 
colleges and universities to talent of every sort, no matter in what social 
circles it may appear. 


482 


This is an imperative necessity, for thus alone will it be possible to 
develop a talented body of public leaders from among the class which has 
acquired sterile learning. 


There is still another reason why the State should provide for this 
situation. Our intellectual class, particularly in Germany, is so shut up in itself 
and fossilised that it lacks living contact with the classes beneath it. 


Two evil consequences result from this. Firstly, the intellectual class 
neither understands nor sympathises with the broad masses. It has been so long 
cut off from all connection with them that it cannot understand their psychology. 


It has become estranged from the people. Secondly, the intellectual class 
lacks the necessary will-power, for this faculty 1s always weaker in cultivated 
circles, which live in seclusion, than among the primitive masses of the 
people. 


God knows, we Germans have never been lacking in abundant scientific 
culture, but we have always had a considerable lack of will-power and of the 
capacity for making decisions. 


For example, the more ‘intellectual’ our statesmen have been, the more 
lacking they have been, for the most part, in practical achievement. 


Our political preparation and our technical equipment for the World War 
were defective, certainly not because the brains governing the nation were too 
little educated, but because the men who directed our public affairs were over- 
educated, filled to overflowing with knowledge and intelligence, yet without 
any sound instinct and simply without energy, or any spirit of daring. 


It was our nation’s tragedy to have to fight for its existence under a 
Chancellor who was a dilly-dallying philosopher. If, instead of a Bethmann- 
Hollweg, we had had a more robust man of the people as our leader, the heroic 
blood of the common grenadier would not have been shed 1n vain. 


The exaggeratedly intellectual material out of which our leaders were 
made, proved to be the best ally of the scoundrels who carried out the 
November Revolution. 


These intellectuals safeguarded the national wealth in a miserly fashion; 
instead of conscripting it to its limits they created the conditions under which 
others won success. 


483 


Here, the Catholic Church presents an instructive example. Clerical 
celibacy forces the Church to recruit its priests not from their own ranks, but 
progressively from the masses of the people. 


Yet there are not many who recognise the significance of celibacy in this 
relation. Therein lies the cause of the inexhaustible vigour which characterises 
that ancient institution. 


By unceasingly recruiting the ecclesiastical dignitaries from the lower 
classes of the people, the Church is enabled not only to maintain the contact of 
instinctive understanding with the masses of the population, but also to assure 
itself of always being able to draw upon that fund of energy which is present 
only among the lower classes. Hence the surprising youthfulness of that 
gigantic organism, its mental flexibility and its iron resolution. 


It will be the task of the volkisch State so to organise and administer its 
educational system that the existing intellectual-class will be constantly 
furnished with a supply of fresh blood from beneath. 


From the bulk of the nation the State must sift out with careful scrutiny 
those persons who are endowed with natural talents and see to it that they are 
employed in the service of the community, for neither the State itself nor the 
various departments of State exist to furnish revenues for members of a special 
class, but to fulfil the tasks allotted to them. 


This will be possible, however, only if the State trains individuals 
especially for these offices. Such individuals must have the necessary 
fundamental capability and will-power. The principle does not hold good only 
in regard to the, civil service, but also in regard to all those who are to take 
part in the intellectual and moral leadership of the people, no matter in what 
sphere they may be employed. 


The greatness of a people is partly dependent on the condition that it 
must succeed in training the best brains for those branches of the public service 
for which they show a special natural aptitude and in placing them in the 
offices where they can do their best work for the good of the community. 


If two nations of equal strength and quality engage in a mutual conflict, 
that nation will come out victorious which has entrusted its intellectual and 
moral leadership to its best talents and that nation will go under whose 
government represents only a common food trough for privileged groups or 


484 


classes irrespective of the innate talents of its individual members. 


Of course, such a reform seems impossible in the world as it is to-day. 
The objection will at once be raised, that it is too much to expect from the 
favourite son of a highly-placed civil servant, for instance, that he shall work 
with his hands simply because somebody else, whose parents belong to the 
working-class, seems more capable of filling a job in the civil service. 


That argument may be valid as long as manual work is looked upon as it 
is looked upon to-day. Hence the vdlkisch State will have to take up an attitude 
towards the appreciation of manual labour which will be fundamentally 
different from that which now exists. 


If necessary, it will have to organise a persistent system of teaching 
which will aim at abolishing the stupid present-day habit of looking down on 
manual labour as an occupation of which to be ashamed. 


The individual will have to be valued, not by the class of work he does, 
but by the way in which he does it and by its usefulness to the community. 


This statement may sound monstrous in an epoch when the most brainless 
column-writer on a newspaper staff is more esteemed than the most expert 
mechanic, merely because the former pushes a pen. 


But, as I have said, this false valuation does not correspond to the true 
nature of things. It has been artificially introduced, and there was a time when 
it did not exist at all. 


The present unnatural state of affairs is one of those general morbid 
phenomena that have arisen from our materialistic epoch. 


Fundamentally, every kind of work has a double value; the one material, 
the other ideal. The material value depends on the importance of the work in 
the life of the community. 


The greater the number of the population who benefit from the work, 
directly or indirectly, the higher will be its material value. 


This evaluation is expressed in the material recompense which the 
individual receives for his labour. 


In contradiction to this purely material value there 1s the ideal value. 
Here the work performed is not judged by its material importance, but by the 


485 


degree to which it answers a necessity. 


Certainly the material utility of an invention may be greater than that of 
the service rendered by an ordinary workman; but it is also certain that the 
community needs each of those small daily services just as much as the greater 
Services. 


From the material point of view a distinction can be made in the 
evaluation of different kinds of work according to their utility to the 
community, and this; distinction is expressed by differentiation in the scale of 
recompense; but on the ideal or abstract plane all workmen become equal the 
moment each strives to do his best in his own field, no matter what that field 
may be. 


It is on this that a man’s value must be estimated, and not on the amount 
of recompense received. 


Ina sensibly governed State care must be taken that each individual is 
given the kind of work which corresponds to his capabilities. 


In other words, people will be trained for the positions indicated by 
their natural endowments; but these endowments or faculties are innate and 
cannot be acquired by any amount of training, being a gift of Nature and not the 
reward of effort. 


Therefore, the way in which men are generally esteemed by their fellow- 
citizens must not be according to the kind of work they do, because that has 
been more or less assigned to the individual. 


Seeing that the kind of work on which the individual is employed is 
determined by his circumstances and the training which he has, in consequence, 
received from the community. He will have to be judged by the way in which 
he performs the work entrusted to him by the community, for the work which 
the individual performs is not the purpose of his existence, but only a means of 
livelihood. 


His real purpose in life is to better himself and raise himself to a higher 
level as a human being; but this he can only do in and through the community, 
whose cultural life he shares and this community must always exist on the 
foundations of a State. 


He must contribute to the conservation of those foundations. Nature 


486 


determines the form of this contribution. It is the duty of the individual to return 
to the community, zealously and honestly, what the community has given him. 


He who does this deserves the highest respect and esteem. Material 
remuneration may be given to him whose work has a corresponding utility for 
the community; but the ideal recompense must lie in the esteem to which 
everyone has a claim who serves his nation with whatever powers Nature has 
bestowed upon him and which have been developed by the training he has 
received from the national community. Then it will no longer be dishonourable 
to be an honest craftsman, but it will be a source of disgrace to be an 
inefficient State official, wasting God’s day and filching one’s daily bread 
from an honest public. 


Then it will be looked upon as quite natural that positions should not be 
given to persons who, of their very nature, are incapable of filling them. 


Furthermore, this personal efficiency will be the sole criterion of the 
right to take part on an equal juridical footing in general civic affairs. 


The present epoch is working out its own ruin. It introduces universal 
suffrage and chatters about equal rights, but can find no foundation for this 
equality. 


It considers the material wage as the expression of a man’s value and 
thus destroys the basis of the noblest kind of equality that can exist, for equality 
cannot and does not depend on the work a man does, but only on the manner in 
which each one does the particular work allotted to him. 


Thus alone will the mere accident of birth be set aside in determining the 
worth of a man and thus only does the individual become the creator of his 
own social worth. 


At the present time, when whole groups of people estimate each other’s 
value only by the size of the salaries which they respectively receive, there can 
be no understanding of all this, but that is no reason why we should cease to 
champion these ideas. 


On the contrary, in an epoch which 1s inwardly diseased and decaying 
anyone who would heal it must have the courage first to probe to the real roots 
of the disease. 


The National Socialist Movement must take that duty on its shoulders, it 


487 


must act over the heads of the small bourgeoisie and rally together and 
coordinate all those elements within the community which are fit to become the 
protagonists of a new Weltanschauung. 


Of course the objection will be made that in general it is difficult to 
differentiate between the material and ideal values of work and that the lower 
prestige which is attached to manual labour is due to the fact that smaller 
wages are paid for that kind of work. 


It will be said that the lower wage is, in its turn, the reason why the 
manual worker has less chance to participate in the culture of the nation, so that 
the ideal side of human culture is less open to him although it may have nothing 
to do with his daily activities. 


It may be added that reluctance to do physical work 1s justified by the 
fact that, on account of his low wages the cultural level of the manual labourer 
must naturally be low, and that this in turn is a justification for the lower 
estimation in which manual labour is generally held. There is a good deal of 
truth in all this, but that is the very reason why we ought to see that in future 
there should not be such a wide difference in the scale of remuneration. We 
will not entertain the argument that under such condition: poorer work would 
be done. It would be the saddest symptom of decadence if finer intellectual 
work could be obtained only through the stimulus of higher payment. 


If that point of view had ruled the world up to now, humanity would 
never have come into its great scientific and cultural heritage, for the greatest 
inventions, the greatest discoveries, the most profoundly revolutionary 
scientific work, and the most magnificent monuments of human culture, were 
not given to the world from greed of gain. 


On the contrary only too often the fact that they were given to the world 
meant a renunciation of the worldly pleasures that wealth can purchase. 


It may be that money has become the one power that governs life to-day, 
yet a time will come when men will again bow to higher gods. 


Much that we have to-day owes its existence to the desire for money and 
property, but there 1s very little among all this which would leave the world 
poorer by its absence. 


It is also one of the aims of our Movement to hold out the prospect of a 
time when the individual will be given what he needs for the purposes of his 


488 


life and it will be a time in which, on the other hand, the principle will be 
upheld that man does not live for material enjoyment alone. 


This principle will find expression in a wisely limited scale of wages 
and salaries which will enable everyone, including the humblest workman who 
fulfils his duties conscientiously, to live an honourable and decent life both as 
a man and as a citizen. 


Let it not be said that this 1s merely a visionary ideal, that this world 
would never tolerate it in practice and that of itself it is impossible to attain. 


Even we are not so simple as to believe that there will ever be an age in 
which there will be no drawbacks, but that does not release us from the 
obligation to fight for the removal of the defects which we have recognised, to 
overcome the shortcomings and to strive towards the ideal. 


In any case, the hard reality of the facts to be faced will always place 
only too many limits on our aspirations. But that 1s precisely why man must 
strive again and again to serve the ultimate aim. No failures must induce him to 
renounce his intentions, just as we cannot spurn the sway of justice because 
mistakes creep into the administration of the law, and just as we cannot despise 
medical science because, in spite of it, there will always be disease. 


Man should take care not to have too low an estimate of the power of an 
ideal. If there are some who feel disheartened over present conditions, and if 
they happen to have served as soldiers, I would remind them of the time when 
their heroism was the most convincing example of the power inherent in ideal 
motives. It was not preoccupation about their daily bread that led men to 
sacrifice their lives, but love of their country, the faith which they had in its 
greatness, and the common struggle to uphold the honour of the nation. 


Only after the German people had abandoned these ideals in favour of 
the material promises offered by the Revolution, only after they had exchanged 
their arms for the rucksack, only then—instead of entering an earthly paradise 
—did they think into the purgatory of universal contempt and universal want. 


That is why we must confront the calculators of the materialistic 
Republic with faith in an ideal Reich.

CHAPTER II: CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE 
STATE 


The institution that is now erroneously called the State generally 
classifies people in two groups—citizens and aliens. 


Citizens are all those who possess full civic rights, either by reason of 
their birth or by an act of naturalization. Aliens are those who enjoy the same 
rights in some other State. 


Between these two categories there are certain beings who resemble a 
sort of meteoric phenomena. They are people who have no citizenship in any 
State and consequently no civic-rights anywhere. 


In most cases, a person acquires civic rights nowadays by being born 
within the frontiers of a State. The race or nationality to which he may belong 
plays no role whatsoever. 


The child of a Negro who once lived in one of the German protectorates 
and now takes up his residence in Germany automatically becomes a ‘German 
citizen’ in the eyes of the world. 


In the same way the child of any Jew, Pole, African or Asian may 
automatically become a German citizen. 


Besides nationality that 1s acquired through the fact of having been born 
within the confines of a State, there exists another kind of nationality which can 
be acquired later. 


This process is subject to various preliminary requirements. For 
example, one condition is that, if possible, the applicant must not be a burglar 


or a pimp. 
His political attitude must be such as to give no cause for uneasiness; in 
other words, he must be a harmless simpleton in politics. 


It is required that he shall not be a burden to the State of which he wishes 
to become a citizen. In this realistic epoch of ours this last condition naturally 
only means that he must not be a financial burden. 


492 


If the affairs of the candidate are such that it appears likely he will turn 
out to be a good taxpayer, that is a very important consideration and will help 
him to obtain civic rights all the more rapidly. The question of race plays no 
part at all. 


The whole process of acquiring civic rights is not very different from 
that of being admitted to membership of an automobile club, for instance: A 
person files his application; it is examined; it is sanctioned, and one day the 
man receives a card which informs him that he has become a citizen. The 
information is given in an amusing way. An applicant who has hitherto been a 
Zulu or a Kaffir is informed, “By these presents you have now become a 
German citizen.” 


The President of the State can perform this piece of magic. What God 
Himself could not do is achieved by some Theophrastus Paracelsus of a civil 
servant. A stroke of the pen, and a Mongolian slave is forthwith turned into a 
real ‘German’. 


Not only is no question asked regarding the race to which the new citizen 
belonged; even the matter of his physical health is not inquired into. 


His flesh may be corrupt with syphilis; but he will still be welcome in 
the State as it exists to-day, as long as he is not likely to become a financial 
burden or a political menace. 


In this way, year after year, those organisms which we call States absorb 
poisonous matter which they can hardly ever overcome. 


Another point of distinction between a citizen and an alien is that the 
former is admitted to all public offices, that he may possibly have to do 
military service and that in return, he is permitted to take a passive or active 
part at public elections. 


Those are his chief privileges, for in regard to personal rights and 
personal liberty the alien enjoys the same amount of protection as the citizen, 
and frequently even more. 


Anyhow that is what happens in our present German Republic. I fully 
realise that nobody likes to hear these things, but it would be difficult to find 
anything more illogical or more insane than our contemporary laws in regard to 
State citizenship. 


493 


At present there exists one State which is making at least a feeble attempt 
to follow a sounder principle in this respect. It is not, however, in our model 
German Republic, but in the U.S.A. that efforts are being made to conform at 
least partly to the dictates of common sense. 


By refusing to allow immigrants to enter the country if they are in a bad 
state of health, and by excluding certain races from the right to become 
naturalised as citizens, they have begun to introduce principles similar to those 
on which we wish to ground the volkisch State. 


The volkisch State will classify its population in three groups, namely, 
citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens. 


The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the 
status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under 
the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive 
part in elections. 


Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the 
State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a 
subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of 
his nationality. 


The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the 
former is a citizen of another country. 


A boy of German nationality who is a subject of the German State is 
bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every 
German. 


Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him, race- 
conscious and make him realise that he is a member of the folk-community. 


Then he has to fulfil all those requirements laid down by the State in 
regard to physical training after he has left school, and finally he enters the 
Army. 


The training in the Army is of a general kind. It must be given to each 
individual German and will render him competent to fulfil the physical and 
mental requirements of military service. 


The rights of citizenship will be conferred on every young man, whose 


494 


health and character have been certified as good, after having completed his 
period of military service. 


This act of admission to the dignity of citizenship will be a solemn 
ceremony, and the diploma conferring the rights of citizenship will be 
preserved by the young man as a most precious testimonial throughout his 
whole life. 


It entitles him to exercise all the rights of a citizen and to enjoy all the 
privileges attached thereto, for the State must draw a sharp line of distinction 
between those who, as members of the nation, are the foundation and the 
support of its existence and greatness, and those who are domiciled in the State 
simply because they earn their livelihood there. 


On the occasion of receiving a diploma of citizenship the new citizen 
must take a solemn oath of loyalty to the national community and the State. 


This diploma must be a bond which unites all the various classes and 
sections of the nation. It must be regarded as a greater honour to be a citizen of 
this Reich, even as a street-sweeper, than to be the king of a foreign State. 


The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the 
master in the Reich, but this high honour brings with it obligations. 


Those who are without personal honour or character, who are common 
criminals, or traitors to the Fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the 
rights of citizenship. Thereby they revert to the status of mere subjects of the 
State. 


The German girl is a subject of the State, but becomes a citizen when she 
marries. At the same time those women who earn their livelihood 
independently have the right to acquire citizenship, if they are German 
subjects. 


495 


496 


497 


CHAPTER IV: PERSONALITY AND THE IDEAL OF 
THE VOLKISCH STATE 


If the principal duty of the national socialist volkisch State be to educate 
and promote the existence of those who constitute the material out of which the 
State is formed, it will not be sufficient to promote those racial elements as 
such, educate them and finally train them for practical life. The State must also 
adapt its own organisation to meet the exigencies of this task. 


It would be absurd to appraise a man’s worth by the race to which he 
belongs, and at the same time to make war against the Marxist principle that all 
men are equal, without being determined to pursue our own principle to its 
logical conclusion. 


If we admit the significance of blood, that is to say, if we recognise the 
race as the fundamental element on which all life is based, we shall have to 
apply to the individual the logical consequences of this principle. 


In general I must estimate the worth of nations differently, on the basis of 
the different races from which they spring, and I must also differentiate in 
estimating the, worth of the individual within his own race. 


The principle that one people is not the same as another, applies also to 
the individual members of a national community, just as no one man, for 
instance, is equal to another, because the constituent elements belonging to the 
same blood vary in a thousand subtle details, though they are fundamentally of 
the same quality. 


The first consequence of recognition of this fact is, if I may use such an 
expression, somewhat crude, being an attempt to help and promote those 
elements within the folk-community which are of particular value from the 
racial point of view and to encourage them to increase and multiply. 


This task is comparatively simple because it can be recognised and 
carried out almost mechanically. 


It is much more difficult to select from among the whole bulk of the 
people those who actually possess the highest intellectual and spiritual 
characteristics and to assign them to that sphere of influence which not only 
corresponds to their outstanding talents, but in which their activities will be of 


498 


benefit to the nation. 


Selection according to capacity and efficiency cannot be effected ina 
mechanical way. It is a work which can be accomplished only through the 
permanent struggle of everyday life itself. A Weltanschauung which repudiates 
the democratic principle of the rule of the masses and aims at giving this world 
to the best people—that is, to the highest quality of mankind—must also apply 
that same aristocratic postulate to the individuals within the folk-community. 


It must take care that the positions of leadership and highest influence are 
given to the best men. Hence it is not based on the idea of the majority, but on 
that of personality. 


Anyone who believes that the volkisch National Socialist State should 
distinguish itself from the other States only mechanically, as it were, through 
the better construction of its economic life—thanks to a better equilibrium 
between poverty and riches, or to the extension to broader masses of the power 
to determine the economic process, or to a fairer wage-system, or to the 
elimination of vast differences in the scale of salaries—understands only the 
superficial feature, of our Movement and has not the least idea of what we man 
when we speak of our Weltanschauung. 


All these features just mentioned could not guarantee us a lasting 
existence and certainly would be no warranty of greatness. 


A nation that could content itself with external reforms, would not have 
the slightest chance of success in the general struggle for life among the nations 
of the world. 


A movement that confined its mission to such adjustments, however right 
and equitable, would effect no far-reaching or profound reform of the existing 
order. 


The whole effect of such measures would be limited to externals. They 
would not furnish the nation with that moral armament which alone will enable 
it effectively to overcome the weaknesses from which we are suffering to-day. 


In order to elucidate this point of view it may be worth while to glance 
once again at the real origins and causes of the cultural evolution of mankind. 


The first step which visibly raised mankind above the animal world was 
that which led to the first invention. 


499 


The invention itself owes its origin to the ruses and stratagems which 
man employed to assist him in the struggle for existence against, other 
creatures and often to provide him with the only means he could adopt to 
achieve success in this struggle. 


Those first very crude inventions do not reveal the individual 
personality, for the subsequent observer, that is to say, the modern observer, 
recognises them only as collective phenomena. 


Certain tricks and skilful tactics which can be observed among animals 
strike the eye of the observer as established facts which may be seen 
everywhere and man is no longer ina position to discover or explain their 
primary cause and so he contents himself with calling such phenomena 
instinctive. 


In our case, this term has no meaning, because everyone who believes in 
the higher evolution of living organisms must admit that every manifestation of 
the vital urge and struggle to live must have had a definite, beginning in time 
and that one subject alone must have manifested it for the first time. 


It was then repeated again and again, and the practice of it spread over a 
widening area, until finally it passed into the subconsciousness of every 
member of the species, where it manifested itself as ‘instinct.’ 


This is more easily understood and more easy to believe in the case of 
man. His first skilled tactics in the struggle against the rest of the animals 
undoubtedly originated with individuals possessing special capabilities. 


There can be no doubt that personality was then the sole factor in all 
decisions and achievements which were afterwards taken over by the whole of 
humanity as a matter of course. 


An exact exemplification of this may be found in those fundamental 
military principles which have now become the basis of all strategy in war. 


Originally, they sprang from the brain of a single individual and in the 
course of many years, maybe even thousands of years, they were accepted all 
around as a matter of course and thus gained universal validity. 


Man supplemented his first discovery by making a second. Among other 
things he learned how to master other living beings and make then serve him in 
his struggle for existence, and thus began the real inventive activity of mankind, 


500 


as it is now evident to its. 


Those material inventions, beginning with the use of stones as weapons, 
which led to the domestication of animals and the production of fire by 
artificial means, down to the many marvellous inventions of our own day, 
reveal more clearly the individual as the originator, the nearer we come to our 
own time and the more important and revolutionary the inventions become. 


All the material inventions which we see around us have been produced 
by the creative powers and capabilities of individuals, and all these inventions 
help man to raise himself higher and higher above the animal world and to 
separate himself from that world in an absolutely definite way. 


Hence, they serve fundamentally to promote the continued progress of the 
human species. What the most primitive artifice once did for man in his 
struggle for existence, as he went hunting in the primeval forest, is being done 
for him today in the form of marvellous scientific inventions which help him to 
wage the present-day struggle for life and forge weapons for future struggles. 


Ultimately, all human thought and all human inventions help man in his 
life-struggle on this planet, even though the so-called practical utility of an 
invention, a discovery or a profound scientific theory, may not be evident at 
first sight. 


Everything contributes to raise man higher and higher above the level of 
all the other creatures that surround him, thereby strengthening and 
consolidating his position, so that he develops more and more in every 
direction as the ruling being on this earth. 


Hence, all inventions are the result of the creative faculty of the 
individual and all such individuals, whether they have willed it or not, are, ina 
greater or lesser degree, benefactors of mankind. 


Through their work millions, and indeed billions, of human beings have 
been provided with means which facilitate their struggle for existence. 


If then we see the inventive minds to which we owe the origin of the 
material civilisation of our day, as individuals who supplement one another 
and continue the work their predecessors have begun, the same is true in regard 
to the practical application of those inventions and discoveries. For all the 
various methods of production are in their turn inventions also and 
consequently dependent on the creative faculty of the individual. 


501 


Even the purely theoretical work, which cannot be measured by a 
definite rule and is preliminary to all subsequent technical discoveries, is 
exclusively the product of the individual brain. 


Humanity in bulk does not turn out inventions, nor does the majority 
organise and think, but only the individual man. 


Accordingly, a human community is well organised only when it 
facilitates to the highest possible degree individual creative forces and utilises 
their work for the benefit of the community. 


The most valuable factor of an invention, whether it be in the world of 
material realities or in the world of abstract ideas, is the personality of the 
inventor himself. 


The first and supreme duty of an organised folk-community is to place 
the inventor in a position where he can be of the greatest benefit to all. 


Indeed, the very purpose of the organisation is to put this principle into 
practice. Only by so doing can it ward off the curse of mechanisation and 
become a living thing. 


In itself it must personify the effort to place men of brains above the 
multitude and to make the latter obey the former. 


Therefore, not only does the organisation possess no right to prevent men 
of brains from rising above the multitude but, on the contrary, 1t must use its 
organising powers to enable and promote their progress as far as it possibly 
can. 


It must set out from the principle that the blessings of mankind never 
came from the masses, but from the creative brains of individuals, who are 
therefore the real benefactors of humanity. 


It is in the interest of all to ensure men of creative brains a decisive 
influence and facilitate their work. This common interest is surely not served 
by allowing the multitude to rule, for it 1s not capable of thinking nor is it 
efficient and in no circumstances whatsoever can it be said to be gifted. 


Only those should rule who have the natural temperament and gifts of 
leadership. 


Such men of brains are selected mainly, as I have already said, through 


502 


the hard struggle for existence itself. 


In this struggle there are many who break down and collapse and thereby 
show that they are not called upon by Destiny to fill the highest positions, and 
only very few are left who can be classed among the elect. 


In the realm of thought and of artistic creation, and even in the economic 
field, this same process of selection takes place even to-day, although— 
especially in the economic field—its operation is heavily handicapped. 


This same principle of selection holds good in the administration of the 
State and in that force which is represented by the organised military defence 
of the nation. 


The idea of personality, of the authority of the individual over his 
subordinates and of the responsibility of the individual towards the persons 
who are placed over him dominates in every sphere of life. It 1s only in 
political life that this very natural principle has been completely ignored. 


Though all human civilisation has resulted exclusively from the creative 
activity of the individual, the principle that it is ‘the majority which counts,’ 
persists throughout the entire, national community and more especially as 
regards its administration, whence the poison gradually filters into all branches 
of national life, thus causing a veritable decomposition. 


The destructive activities of Judaism in different parts of the national 
body can be ascribed fundamentally to the persistent Jewish efforts at 
undermining the importance of personality among the nations that are their 
hosts and, in place of personality, substituting the domination of the masses. 


The constructive principle of Aryan humanity is thus displaced by the 
destructive principle of the Jews. They are the ferment of decomposition’ 
among nations and races and, ina broad sense, the wreckers of human 
civilisation. 


Marxism represents the most striking phase of the Jewish endeavour to 
eliminate the dominant significance of personality in every sphere of human 
life and to replace it by the numerical power of the masses. 


In politics the parliamentary form of government is the expression of this 
effort. We can observe the fatal effects of it everywhere, from the smallest 
parish council upwards to the highest government circles in the Reich. 


503 


In the field of economics we have the trade-union movement, which 
serves not the real interests of the employees, but the destructive aims of 
international Jewry. In the same degree in which the principle of personality is 
excluded from the economic life of the nation, and the influence and activities 
of the masses substituted in its stead, national economy, which should be for 
the service and benefit of the community as a whole, will gradually deteriorate 
in creative capacity. 


The works committees which, instead of caring for the interests of the 
employees, strive to influence the process of production, serve the same 
destructive purpose. 


They damage production as a whole and consequently injure the 
individual engaged in industry, for in the long run it is impossible to satisfy 
popular demands merely by high-sounding theoretical phrases. 


These can be satisfied only by supplying goods to meet the individual 
needs of daily life and by so doing, creating the conviction that, through the 
productive collaboration of its members, the folk-community serves the 
interests of the individual. 


Even if, on the basis of its mass-theory, Marxism should prove itself 
capable of taking over and developing the present economic system, this would 
not be of vital significance. 


The question as to whether the Marxist doctrine be right or wrong cannot 
be decided by any test which would show that it can administer for futurity 
what already exists to-day. It need only be asked whether it has the creative 
power to build up, according to its own principles, a civilisation which would 
be a counterpart of what already exists. 


Even if Marxism were a thousandfold capable of taking over the 
economic system as we now have it, and of maintaining it in operation under 
Marxist direction, such an achievement would prove nothing. This is because, 
on the basis of its own principles, Marxism would never be able to create 
anything which could supplant what exists to-day. 


Marxism itself has furnished the proof that it cannot do this. Not only has 
it been unable to create a cultural or economic system of its own anywhere; but 
it was not even able to develop, according to its own principles, the 
civilisation and economic system it found ready to hand. 


504 


It has had to make compromises, by way of a return to the principle of 
personality, nor can it dispense with that principle in its own organisation. 


The volkisch Weltanschauung differs fundamentally from the Marxist by 
reason of the fact that the former recognises the significance of race and 
therefore also of personal worth and has made these the pillars of its structure. 


These are the most important factors of this Weltanschauung. If the 
National Socialist Movement should fail to understand the fundamental 
importance of this essential principle, if it should content itself with patching 
up the present State from without and adopt the majority principle, 1t would 
really do nothing more than compete with Marxism on its own ground. For that 
reason it would not have the right to call itself a Weltanschauung. 


If the social programme of the movement consisted in eliminating 
personality and putting the multitude in its place, then National Socialism 
would be corrupted with the poison of Marxism, just as our bourgeois parties 
are. 


The volkisch State must ensure the welfare of its citizens by recognising 
the importance of the individual in all circumstances and by preparing the way 
for the maximum of productive efficiency in all the various branches of 
economic life, thus securing to the individual the highest possible share in the 
general output. 


Hence, the vol/kisch State must mercilessly eliminate from all the leading 
circles in the government of the country the parliamentarian principle, 
according to which decisive power through the majority vote is invested in the 
multitude. Personal responsibility must be substituted in its stead. 


Thus we arrive at the following conclusion; The best constitution and the 
best form of government is that which, as a matter of course, renders it 
possible for the best brains to reach a position of dominant importance and 
influence in the community. 


Just as in the field of economics men of outstanding ability cannot be 
selected from above, but must come to the fore by virtue of their own efforts, 
and just as there is an unceasing educative process that leads from the smallest 
shop to the largest undertaking, and just as life itself provides the necessary 
tests, so in the political field it is not possible to ‘discover’ political talent at 
short notice. 


505 


Genius of an extraordinary stamp precludes consideration of the claims 
of the average man. In its organisation, the State must be established on the 
principle of personality, starting from the smallest cell and ascending to the 
supreme man in the government of the country. 


There are no decisions made by the majority vote, but only by 
responsible persons, and the word ‘council’ is once more restored to its 
original meaning. 


Every man in a position of responsibility will have counsellors at his 
side, but the decision is made by that individual alone. 


The principle which made the former Prussian Army an admirable 
instrument of the German nation will have to become the basis of our state 
constitution, that is to say, full authority over his subordinates must be invested 
in each leader and he must be responsible to those above him. 


Even then we shall not be able to do without those corporations which at 
present we call parliaments, but they will be real councils, in the sense that 
they, will have to give advice. The responsibility can and must be borne by one 
individual, who alone will be vested with authority and the right to command. 


Parliaments as such are necessary, because they alone furnish the 
opportunity for leaders, who will subsequently be entrusted with positions of 
special responsibility, to rise gradually to authority. 


The following is an outline of the picture which the organisation will 
present. From the municipal administration up to the government of the Reich, 
the vélkisch State will not have any body of representatives which makes its 
decisions by a majority vote. 


It will have only advisory bodies to assist the chosen leader for the time 
being and he will distribute among them the various duties they are to perform. 


In certain fields they may, if necessary, have to assume full 
responsibility, such as the leader or president of each corporation possesses on 
a larger scale. 


In principle the volkisch State must forbid the custom of taking advice on 
certain political problems (economics, for instance) from parsons who are 
entirely incompetent, because they lack special training and practical 
experience in such matters. 


506 


Consequently, the State must divide its representative bodies into a 
political chamber and a corporative chamber that represents the respective 
trades and professions. 


To assure effective co-operation between those two bodies, a selected 
body, or senate will be placed ever them. No vote will be taken in the 
chambers or in the senate. They are to be organisations for work and not voting 
machines. 


The individual members will have consultative votes, but no right of 
decision will be attached thereto. The right of decision belongs exclusively to 
the president, who must be entirely responsible for the matter under discussion. 


This principle of combining absolute authority with absolute 
responsibility will gradually cause a selected group of leaders to emerge—a 
thing which is impossible in our present epoch of irresponsible 
parliamentarianism. 


The political construction of the nation will thereby be brought into 
harmony with those laws to which the nation already owes its greatness in the 
economic and cultural spheres. 


Regarding the possibility of putting these principles into practice, I 
should like to call attention to the fact that the principle of parliamentarian 
democracy, whereby decisions are enacted through the majority vote, has not 
always ruled the world. 


On the contrary, we find it prevalent only during short periods of history 
and these have always been periods of decline in nations and States. 


One must not believe, however, that such a radical change could be 
effected by measures of a purely theoretical character, operating from above 
downwards. The change I have been describing could not be limited to 
transforming the constitution of a State, but would have to include the various 
fields of legislation and civic existence as a whole. 


Such a revolution can be brought about only by means of a movement 
which is itself organised on the lines of these principles and thus bears, the 
germ of the future State in its own organism. 


Therefore, it is well for the National Socialist Movement to make itself 
completely familiar with these principles today and actually to put them into 


507 


practice within its own organisation, so that not only will it be in a position to 
serve as a guide for the future State, but will have so far completed its own 
constitution that it can be placed at the disposal of the State itself.

CHAPTER V: WELTANSCHAUUNG AND 
ORGANISATION 


The volkisch state, which I have tried to sketch in general outline, will 
not yet become a reality by virtue of the simple fact that we know the 
conditions indispensable for its existence. 


It does not suffice to know what aspect such a State would present. The 
problem of its foundation is far more important. 


The parties which exist at present and which draw their, profits from the 
State, as it now is, cannot be expected to bring about a radical change in the 
regime or to change their attitude on their own initiative. 


This is rendered all the more impossible because those who now have 
the direction of affairs in their hands are all of them Jews. 


The trend of development which we are now experiencing would, if 
allowed to go on unchecked, lead to the realisation of the pan-Jewish prophecy 
that the Jews will one day devour the other nations and become lords of the 
earth. 


In contrast to the millions of ‘bourgeois’ and ‘proletarian’ Germans, who 
are stumbling to their ruin, mostly through timidity, indolence and stupidity, the 
Jew pursues his way persistently and keeps his eye always fixed on his future 
goal. 


Any party that is led by him fights for no other interests than his, and his 
interests certainly have nothing in common with those of the Aryan nations. 


If we would transform our ideal picture of the vol/kisch State into a 
reality we shall have to keep independent of the forces that now control public 
life and seek for new forces that will be ready and capable of taking up the 
fight for such an ideal. 


For a fight it will have to be, since the first task will not be to build up 
the idea of the volkisch State, but rather to wipe out the Jewish State which 
now exists. 


As so often happens in the course of history, the main difficulty is not to 
establish a new order of things, but to clear the ground for its establishment. 


511 


Prejudices and egotistic interests join together in forming a common 
front against the new idea and in trying by every means to prevent its triumph, 
because it is disagreeable to them or threatens their existence. That 1s why the 
protagonist of the new idea is, unfortunately, in spite of his desire for 
constructive work, compelled to wage a destructive battle first, in order to 
abolish the existing state of affairs. 


A doctrine whose principles are radically new and of essential 
importance must adopt the sharp probe of criticism as its weapon, though this 
may prove disagreeable to the individual followers. 


It is evidence of a very superficial insight into historical developments if 
the supporters of the so-called pseudo-vélkisch movement emphasise again 
and again that they will, in no circumstances, adopt the use of negative 
criticism, but will engage only in constructive work. 


That is nothing but puerile chatter and is typical of all the rubbish talked 
by the adherents of this v6/kisch craze. It is another proof that the history of our 
own times, has made no impression on their minds. 


Marxism, too, has had its aims to pursue and converted and won over to 
the new movement simply by being shown that something new is necessary. 


On the contrary, what may easily happen is that two different situations 
will exist side by side and that a Weltanschauung is transformed into a party, 
above which level it will not be able to raise itself afterwards, for a 
Weltanschauung 1s intolerant and cannot permit another to exist side by side 
with it. 


It imperiously demands its own recognition as unique and exclusive, and 
insists upon a complete reformation of public life in all its branches, in 
accordance with its views. It can never allow the previous state of affairs to 
continue in existence alongside it. 


The same holds true of religions. Christianity was, not content with 
erecting an altar of its own. It had first to destroy the pagan altars. It was only 
by virtue of this passionate intolerance that an apodictic faith could grow up, 
and intolerance is an indispensable condition for the growth of such a faith. 


It may be objected here that in these phenomena which we find 
throughout the history of the world we have to recognise mostly a specifically 
Jewish mode of thought and that such fanaticism and intolerance are typical 


512 


symptoms of the Jewish mentality. 


This may be true a thousand times over and we may regret that it 1s so 
and note with a feeling of uneasiness that this phenomenon has hitherto been 
unknown in the history of mankind—but the hard fact remains that such is the 
situation to-day. 


It is not the business of the men who wish to liberate our German nation 
from the conditions is in which it now exists to burden their brains with 
thinking how excellent it would be if this or that had never occurred. They must 
strive to find ways and means of abolishing what actually exists. 


A philosophy of life which is inspired by a fanatical spirit of intolerance 
can only be set aside by a doctrine that is advanced in an equally ardent spirit 
and fought for with as determined a will and which is itself a new idea, pure 
and absolutely sincere. 


Each one of us today may regret the fact that the advent of Christianity 
was the first occasion on which spiritual terror was introduced into the much 
freer ancient world, but the fact cannot be denied that ever since then, the 
world has been pervaded and dominated by this kind of coercion and that 
violence is broken only by violence and terrorism by terrorism. 


Only then can a new regime be created by means of constructive work. 
Political parties are prone to make compromises, but a Weltanschauung never 
does this. 


A political party even reckons with opponents, but a Weltanschauung 
proclaims its own infallibility. 


In the beginning, political parties have nearly always the intention of 
securing exclusive and despotic domination for themselves. 


They always show a slight tendency to become Weltanschauungen, but 
the limited nature of their programme is in itself enough to rob them of that 
heroic spirit which a Weltanschauung demands. 


The spirit of conciliation, which animates their will, attracts those petty 
and chicken-hearted people who are not fit to take part in any crusade. That is 
the reason why they mostly become stuck in their miserable pettiness very 
early on the march. 


513 


They give up fighting for their ideology and, by way of what they call 
‘positive collaboration,’ they try as quickly as possible to wedge themselves 
into some tiny place at the trough of the existent regime and to stick there as 
long as possible. 


Their whole effort ends at that, and if they should get shouldered away 
from the common manger by competitors with more brutal manners, then their 
only idea is to force themselves in again, by force or chicanery, among the herd 
of all the others who have similar appetites, to get back into the front row, and 
finally—even at the expense of their most sacred convictions—to regale 
themselves anew at that beloved spot where they find their fodder. They are the 
jackals of politics. 


A Weltanschauung will never of itself willingly give ground to another. 
Therefore it can never agree to collaborate in any order of things that it 
condemns. 


On the contrary, it feels obliged to employ every available means in the 
fight against the old order and the whole world of ideas belonging to that order 
and to prepare the way for its destruction. 


These purely destructive tactics, the danger of which 1s so readily 
perceived by the enemy that he forms a united front against them for his 
common defence, and also the constructive tactics, which must be aggressive 
in order to carry the new world of ideas to success—both these phases of the 
struggle call for a body of resolute fighters. Any new Weltanschauung will be 
successful in establishing its ideas only if the most courageous and active 
elements of its epoch and its people are enrolled under its standards and 
grouped firmly together in a powerful fighting organisation. 


To achieve this purpose it is absolutely necessary to select from the 
general ideology a certain number of ideas which will appeal to such 
individuals, and which, once they are expressed in a precise and clear-cut 
form, will serve as articles of faith for a new association of men. 


While the programme of the ordinary political party is nothing but the 
recipe for achieving favourable results at the next general election, the 
programme of a Weltanschauung represents a declaration of war against an 
existing order of things, against present conditions, in short, against the 
established Weltanschauung. 


514 


It is not necessary, however, that every individual fighter for such a new 
doctrine need have a full grasp of the ultimate ideas and plans of those who are 
the leaders of the movement. 


It is only necessary that each should have a clear notion of the 
fundamental ideas and that he should thoroughly assimilated a few of the most 
fundamental principles, so that he will be convinced of the necessity of 
carrying the movement and its doctrines to success. 


The individual soldier is not initiated into the secrets of high strategical 
plans, but he is trained to submit to a rigid discipline, to be passionately 
convinced of the justice and inner might of his cause and to devote himself to it 
without reserve. 


So, too, the individual follower of a movement must be made acquainted 
with its far-reaching purpose, and realise that it is inspired by a powerful will 
and that it has a great future before it. 


Supposing that each soldier in an army were a general, if only as regards 
his training and capacity, that army would not be an efficient fighting 
instrument. 


Similarly, a political movement would not be very efficient in fighting 
for a Weltanschauung if it were made up exclusively of intellectuals. We need 
the private soldier too. Without him no discipline can be established. 


By its very nature, an organisation can exist only if leaders of high 
intellectual ability are served by a large mass of men who are emotionally 
devoted to the cause. 


To maintain discipline in a company of two hundred men who are 
equally intelligent and capable would turn out more difficult in the, long run 
than to maintain discipline in a company of one hundred and ninety less gifted 
men and ten who have had a higher education. 


The Social Democrats have profited by recognising this truth. They took 
the broad masses of our people who had just completed military service and 
learned to submit to discipline, and they subjected this mass of men to the 
discipline of the Social Democratic organisation, which was no less rigid than 
the discipline through which the young men had passed in the course of their 
military training. 


515 


The Social Democratic organisation consisted of an army divided into 
officers and men. The German worker who had completed his military service 
became the private soldier in that army, and the Jewish intelligentsia were its 
officers. 


The German trade-union functionaries may be compared to its non- 
commissioned officers. The fact, which was always looked upon with dismay 
by our middle classes, that only the so-called uneducated classes joined the 
Marxists was the very ground on which this party achieved its success. 


For while the bourgeois parties—because they consisted mostly of 
intellectuals, were only a feckless band of undisciplined individuals—the 
Marxist leaders have formed out of much less intelligent human material an 
army of party combatants who obey their Jewish masters just as blindly as they 
formerly obeyed their German officers. 


The German middle classes, who never bothered their heads about 
psychological problems, because they felt themselves superior to such matters, 
did not think it necessary to reflect on the profound significance of this fact and 
the hidden danger involved in it. 


Indeed, they believed that a political movement which draws its 
followers exclusively from intellectual circles must, for that very reason, be of 
greater importance and have better chances of success, and even a better 
chance of taking over the government of the country than a party made up of the 
ignorant masses. 


They completely failed to realise the fact that the strength of a political 
party never consists in the intelligence and independent spirit of the rank and 
file of its members, but rather in the spirit of willing obedience with which 
they follow their intellectual leaders. 


What is of decisive importance is the leadership itself. When two bodies 
of troops are arrayed in mortal combat, victory will not fall to that side in 
which every soldier has an expert knowledge of the rules of strategy, but rather 
to that side which has the best leaders and, at the same time, the best 
disciplined, most blindly obedient and best drilled troops. 


That is a fundamental fact which we must always bear in mind when we 
examine the possibility of transforming a Weltanschauung into a practical 
reality. 


516 


If we agree that in order to carry a Weltanschauung into practical effect 
it must be incorporated in a fighting movement, then the logical consequence is 
that the programme of such a movement must take account of the human 
material at its disposal. Just as the ultimate aims and fundamental principles 
must be made absolutely definite and intelligible, so the propaganda 
programme must be well drawn up and must be inspired by a keen sense of its 
psychological appeal to the minds of those without whose help the noblest 
ideals will be doomed to remain forever in the realm of visions. 


If the idea of the volkisch State, which is at present an obscure ideal, is 
one day to attain a clear and definite success, from its vague and vast mass of 
thought it will have to put forward certain definite principles which of their 
very nature and content are calculated to attract a broad mass of adherents. In 
other words, such a group of people as can guarantee that these principles will 
be fought for. That group of people is the German working-class. 


That is why the programme of the new Movement was condensed into a 
few fundamental postulates, twenty-five in all. 


They are meant first of all to give the ordinary man a rough idea of what 
the Movement is aiming at. They are, so to speak, a profession of faith which, 
on the one hand, is meant to win adherents for the Movement and, on the other, 
they are meant to unite such adherents together in a covenant to which all have 
subscribed. 


In this connection we must never lose sight of the following fact: What 
we call the programme of the Movement is absolutely right as far as its 
ultimate aims are concerned, but as regards the manner in which that 
programme is formulated certain psychological considerations had to be taken 
into account. 


Hence, in the course of time, the opinion may well arise that certain 
principles should be expressed differently and might be better formulated, but 
any attempt at a different formulation has a fatal effect in most cases, for 
something that ought to be fixed and unshakable thereby becomes the subject of 
discussion. 


AS soon as one single point is removed from the sphere of dogmatic 
certainly, the discussion will not simply result in a new and better formulation 
which will have greater consistency, but may easily lead to endless debates 
and general confusion. 


517 


In such cases, the question must always be carefully considered as to 
whether a new and more adequate formulation is to be preferred, though it may 
cause a controversy within the Movement, or whether it may not be better to 
retain the old formula which, though probably not the best, represents an 
organism enclosed in itself, solid and internally homogeneous. 


Every test shows that the second of these alternatives is preferable, for, 
since in these changes one is dealing only with external forms, such corrections 
will always appear desirable and possible, but the deciding factor is that 
people in general think superficially, and therefore the great danger is that in 
what is merely an external formulation of the programme people will see an 
essential aim of the movement. In that way the will and the combative force at 
the service of the ideal are weakened and the energies that ought to be directed 
towards the outer world are dissipated in programmatic discussions within the 
ranks of the Movement. 


For a doctrine that is actually right in its main features it is less 
dangerous to retain a formulation which may no longer be quite adequate, 
instead of trying to improve it and thereby allowing a fundamental principle of 
the Movement, which had hitherto been considered as solid as granite, to 
become the subject of a general discussion which may have unfortunate 
consequences. 


This is particularly to be avoided as long as a Movement is still fighting 
for victory, for would it be possible to inspire people with blind faith in the 
truth of a doctrine if doubt and uncertainty are encouraged by continual 
alterations in its external formulation? 


The essentials of a doctrine must never be looked for in its external 
formulas, but always in its inner meaning, and this is unchangeable. 


One could only wish that for the sake of this inner meaning a movement 
could exclude everything that tends towards disintegration and uncertainty in 
order to preserve the unified force that 1s necessary for its triumph. 


Here again the Catholic Church has a lesson to teach us. Though 
sometimes, and often quite unnecessarily, its dogmatic system is in conflict 
with the exact sciences and with scientific discoveries, it is not disposed to 
sacrifice one syllable of its teachings. 


It has rightly recognised that its powers of resistance would be 


518 


weakened by introducing greater or lesser doctrinal adaptations to cope with 
temporary scientific discoveries, which are in reality always vacillating, but 
that they gain strength from the fact that it holds fast to its fixed and established 
dogmas which alone can give to the whole system the character of a faith. 


That is the reason why it stands firmer to-day than ever before. We may 
prophesy that, as a fixed star amid fleeting phenomena, it will continue to 
attract increasing numbers of people who will be the more blindly attached to 
it the more rapid the rhythm of changing phenomena around it. 


Therefore, whoever really and seriously desires that the volkisch 
Weltanschauung should triumph must realise that this triumph can be assured 
only through a militant movement and that this movement must found its 
strength only on the granite firmness of an impregnable and well-defined 
programme. 


In regard to its formulas it must never make concessions to the spirit of 
the time, but must maintain the form that has once and for all been decided 
upon as the right one—in any case, until victory has crowned its efforts. 


Before this goal has been reached any attempt to open a discussion on 
the appropriateness of this or that point, in the programme might tend to 
disintegrate the solidarity and fighting strength of the movement, according to 
the measure in which its followers might take part in such an internal dispute. 


Some ‘improvement’ introduced to-day might be subjected to a critical 
examination to-morrow, in order to substitute for it something better the day 
after. 


Once the barrier has been broken down, the way is opened and we know 
only the beginning, but we do not know to what shoreless sea it may lead. 


This important principle had to be acknowledged in practice by the 
members of the National Socialist Movement from the outset. 


In its programme of twenty-five points the National Socialist German 
Labour Party has been furnished with a basis that must remain unshakable. 


The members of the Movement, both present and future, must never feel 
themselves called upon to undertake a critical revision of these postulates, but 
rather feel themselves obliged to put them into practice as they stand. 


519 


Otherwise, the next generation would, in its turn, and with an equal right, 
expend its energy in such purely formal work within the Party, instead of 
winning new adherents for the Movement and thus adding to its power. 


For the majority of our followers the essence of the Movement will 
consist not so much in the letter of our theses as in the meaning that we attribute 
to them. 


The new Movement owes its name to these considerations, and later on 
its programme was drawn up in conformity with them. 


They are the basis of our propaganda. In order to carry the volkisch ideal 
to victory, a popular party had to be founded, a party that did not consist of 
intellectual leaders only, but also of manual labourers. 


Any attempt to carry these theories into effect without the aid of a 
militant organisation would be doomed to failure to-day, as it has failed in the 
past and must fail in the future. 


That is why it is not only the right, but also the duty, of the Movement to 
consider itself as the champion and representative of these ideas. 


Just as the fundamental principles of the National Socialist Movement 
are based on the volkisch idea, vélkisch ideas are National Socialist. 


If National Socialism would triumph it will have to hold firm to this fact 
unreservedly, and here again it is not only its right, but also its duty, to 
emphasise most rigidly that any attempt to represent the vo/kisch idea outside 
of the National Socialist German Labour Party is futile and, in most cases, 
even fraudulent. 


If the reproach should be raised against our Movement that it has 
‘monopolised’ the vé/kisch idea, there 1s only one answer to give. Not only 
have we monopolised the vo/kisch idea but, to all practical intents and 
purposes, we have created it, for what hitherto existed under this name was not 
in the least capable of influencing the destiny of our people, since all those 
ideas lacked a political and coherent formulation. 


In most cases, they were nothing but isolated and incoherent notions 
which were more or less right. Quite frequently these were in open 
contradiction to one another and in no case was there any internal cohesion 
among them. 


520 


Even if this internal cohesion existed it would have been much too weak 
to form the basis of any movement. Only the National Socialist Movement 
proved capable of fulfilling this task. 


All kinds of associations and groups, big as well as small, now claim the 
title volkisch. This is one result of the work which National Socialism has 
done. Without this work, not one of all these parties would have thought of 
adopting the word volkisch at all. 


That expression would have meant nothing to them and especially their 
leaders would have had nothing to do with such an idea. 


Not until the work of the National Socialist German Labour Party had 
given this idea a pregnant meaning did it appear in the mouths of all kinds of 
people. 


Above all, our Party has, by the success of its propaganda, shown the 
force of the volkisch 1dea—so much so that the others, in an effort to gain 
proselytes, find themselves forced to copy our example, at least in words. 


Just as heretofore they exploited everything to serve their petty electoral 
purposes, to-day they use the word volkisch only as an external and hollow- 
sounding phrase for the purpose of counteracting the force of the impression 
which the National Socialist Party makes on the members of the other parties. 


Only the desire to maintain their existence and the fear that our 
Movement may prevail, because it is based on a Weltanschauung that is of 
universal importance, and because they feel that the exclusive character of our 
movement betokens danger for them only for these reasons do they use words 
which they repudiated eight years ago, derided seven years ago, branded as 
stupid six years ago, combated five years ago, hated four years ago, derided 
three years ago and finally, two years ago, annexed and incorporated in their 
present political vocabulary, employing them as slogans in their struggle. 


For this reason, it is necessary even now, not to cease to call attention to 
the fact that not one of those parties has the slightest idea of what the German 
nation needs. The most striking proof of this is provided by the superficial way 
in which they use the word volkisch. 


Not less dangerous are those who run about as pseudo-adherents of the 
volkisch ideal formulating fantastic schemes which are mostly based on 
nothing else than a fixed idea which, in itself, might be right. But because it 1s 


521 


an isolated notion, is of no use whatsoever for the formation of a great 
homogeneous fighting association and could by no means serve as the basis of 
its organisation. 


Those people who concoct a programme which consists partly of their 
own ideas and partly of ideas filched from others, about which they have read 
somewhere, are often more dangerous than the outspoken enemies of the 
volkisch idea. 


At best they are sterile theorists, but more frequently they are 
mischievous agitators. They believe that they can mask their intellectual vanity, 
the futility of their efforts and their lack of ability, by sporting flowing beards 
and indulging in ancient Germanic gestures. 


In the face of all these futile attempts, it is, therefore, worth while to 
recall the time when the new National Socialist Movement began its fight.

CHAPTER VI: THE FIRST PHASE OF OUR 
STRUGGLE—THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
SPOKEN WORD 


The echoes of our first great meeting, in the Festsaal of the Hofbrauhaus 
on February 24th, 1920, had not yet died away when we began preparations 
for our next meeting. 


Up to that time we had had to consider carefully the advisability of 
holding a small meeting every month, or at most every fortnight, in a city like 
Munich; but now it was decided that we should hold a mass meeting every 
week. 


I need not say that on each occasion we anxiously asked ourselves again 
and again: Will the people come and will they listen? Personally, I was firmly 
convinced that if once they came they would remain to listen. 


During that period the hall of the Hofbrauhaus in Munich acquired for us 
National Socialists a sort of mystic significance. 


Every week there was a meeting, almost always in that hall, and each 
time the hall was better filled than on the former occasion, and our public more 
attentive. 


Starting with the theme, ‘Responsibility for the War,’ about which 
nobody cared at that time, and passing on to the discussion of the peace 
treaties, we dealt with almost everything that served to stimulate the minds of 
our hearers and make them interested in our ideas. 


We drew attention to the peace treaties. What the new Movement 
prophesied again and again before those great masses of people has been 
fulfilled in almost every detail. 


Today it is easy to talk and write about these things, but in those days, to 
criticise the Peace Treaty of Versailles at a public mass meeting attended not 
by the small bourgeoisie, but by proletarians who had been worked up by 
agitators, amounted to an attack on the Republic and an evidence of 
reactionary, if not of monarchist, tendencies. 


The moment one uttered the first criticism of the Versailles Treaty one 


525 


could expect an immediate reply, which became almost stereotyped, ‘And what 
about Brest Litovsk?’ 


‘Brest Litovsk!’ And then the crowd would murmur and the murmur 
would gradually swell to a roar, until the speaker would have to give up his 
attempt to persuade them. We felt that we were knocking our heads against a 
brick wall, so thoroughly did we despair of such a public. They neither wanted 
to be told nor to admit that Versailles was a scandal and a disgrace and that the 
dictate signified an act of highway robbery against our people. 


The disruptive work done by the Marxists and the poisonous propaganda 
of the enemy had robbed these people of their reason. 


Nor had we the right to complain, for the guilt on the German side was 
enormous. What had the German bourgeoisie done to call a halt to this terrible 
campaign of disintegration, to oppose it and open a way to a recognition of the 
truth by giving, a better and more thorough explanation of the situation than that 
given by the Marxists? Nothing at all. 


At that time I never saw those who are now the great apostles of the 
people. Perhaps they spoke to select groups, at tea-parties of their own little 
coteries, but where they ought to have been, where the wolves were at work, 
they never dared to appear, unless they found an opportunity of yelling in 
concert with the wolves. 


As for myself, I then saw clearly that for the small group which first 
composed our Movement the question of war-guilt had to be cleared up, and 
cleared up in the light of historical truth. 


A preliminary condition for the future success of our Movement was that 
it should bring knowledge of the meaning of the peace treaties to the minds of 
the masses. In the opinion of the masses, the peace treaties then signified a 
democratic success. 


Therefore, it was necessary to take the opposite side and impress 
ourselves on the minds of the people as the enemies of the peace treaties, so 
that later on, when the naked truth of this despicable swindle should be 
disclosed in all its hideousness, the people would recall the attitude which we 
then took up and would give us their confidence. 


Even at that time I adopted the attitude that if public opinion went astray 
on important and fundamental questions, it was necessary to oppose it, 


526 


regardless of popularity, hatred or the bitterness of the fight. 


The National Socialist German Labour Party ought not to be the servant, 
but rather the master, of public opinion. It must not serve the masses, but 
dominate them. 


In the case of every movement, especially during its struggling stages, 
there is naturally a temptation to conform to the tactics of an opponent and use 
the same battle cries, when his tactics have succeeded in leading the people to 
crazy conclusions, or to adopt a mistaken attitude towards the questions at 
issue. 


This temptation is particularly strong when motives can be found, though 
they are entirely illusory, that seem to point towards the same ends at which the 
young movement is aiming. 


Human poltroonery will then all the more readily adopt those arguments 
which give it a semblance of justification, ‘from its own point of view,’ for 
participating in the criminal policy which the adversary is following. 


On several occasions, I have experienced such crises, in which the 
greatest energy had to be employed to prevent the ship of our Movement from 
being drawn into a general current which had been started artificially, and 
indeed from sailing with it. 


The last occasion was when our accursed press, to which the existence 
of the German nation is unimportant, succeeded in bringing into prominence the 
question of South Tyrol which is bound to prove fatal to the interests of the 
German people. 


Without considering what interests they were serving several so-called 
‘national’ men, parties and leagues, joined in the general cry, simply for fear of 
public opinion which had been excited by the Jews, and foolishly contributed 
to help in the struggle against a system which we Germans ought, particularly 
in these days, to consider as the one ray of light in this distracted world. 


While the international Jew is slowly but surely strangling us, our so- 
called patriots vociferate against a man and his system which have had the 
courage to liberate themselves from the shackles of Jewish freemasonry, at 
least in one quarter of the globe, and to set the forces of national resistance 
against the international world poison. 


527 


But weak characters were tempted to set their sails according to the 
direction of the wind and to capitulate before the storm of public opinion—for 
it was truly a capitulation. 


Even if people are so much in the habit of lying and so morally base that 
they do not admit it even to themselves, the truth remains that only cowardice 
and fear of the public feeling aroused by the Jews induced certain people to 
join in the hue and cry. 


All the other reasons put forward were only the miserable excuses of 
paltry culprits who were conscious of their own crime. 


Then it was necessary to grasp the rudder with an iron hand and turn the 
Movement about, so as to save it from a course that would have set it on the 
rocks. 


Certainly, to attempt such a change of course was not a popular 
manoeuvre at that time, when public opinion had been fanned by every 
conceivable means and its trend was in one direction only. 


Such a decision almost always brings disaster on those who dare to take 
it. In the course of history not a few men have been stoned for an act for which 
posterity has afterwards had reason to thank them on its knees. 


But a movement must count on posterity and not on the plaudits of the 
moment. It may well be that at such times certain individuals have to endure 
hours of anguish, but they should not forget that the moment of liberation will 
come and that a movement which purposes to reshape the world must serve the 
future and not the passing hour. 


In this connection it may be asserted that the greatest and most enduring 
successes in history are mostly those which were least understood at the 
beginning, because they were in direct opposition to public opinion and the 
views and wishes of the time. 


We had experience of this when we made our own first public 
appearance. It can be said in all truth that we did not court public favour, but 
made an onslaught on the follies of our people. 


In those days what happened almost always was that I presented myself 
before an assembly of men who believed the opposite of what I wished to say 
and who wanted the opposite of what I believed in. 


528 


Then I had to spend a couple of hours in convincing two or three 
thousand people that the opinions they had hitherto held were false, in 
destroying the foundations of their views with one blow after another and 
finally in persuading them to take their stand on the grounds of our own 
convictions and our Weltanschauung. 


I learned something that was important at that time, namely, to snatch 
from the hands of the enemy the weapons which he was using in his reply. 


I soon noticed that our adversaries, especially in the persons of those 
who led the discussion against us, were furnished with a definite repertoire of 
arguments out of which they took points against bur claims which they were 
constantly repeating. 


The uniform character of this mode of procedure pointed to a systematic 
and uniform training and so we were able to recognise the incredible way in 
which the enemy’s propagandists had been disciplined and I am proud today 
that I discovered a means not only of making this propaganda ineffective, but of 
beating the authors of it at their own game. 


Two years later I was master of this art. In every speech which I made it 
was important to get a clear idea beforehand of the probable form and matter 
of the counter-arguments we had to expect in the discussion, so that in the 
course of my own specch these could be dealt with and refuted. 


To this end it was necessary to mention all the possible objections and 
show their inconsistency; it was all the easier to win over an honest listener by 
expunging from his memory the arguments which had been impressed upon it, 
so that, I anticipated his replies. 


What he had learned was refuted without having been mentioned by him 
and that made him all the more attentive to what I had to say. 


That was the reason why, after my first lecture on ‘The Peace Treaty of 
Versailles,’ which I delivered to the troops while I was still a political 
instructor in my regiment, I made an alteration in the title and subject and 
henceforth spoke on, ‘The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Versailles.’ I did so 
because, during the discussion which followed my first lecture, I quickly 
ascertained that in reality people knew nothing about the Treaty of Brest- 
Litovsk and that able party propaganda had succeeded in presenting that treaty 
as one of the most scandalous acts of violence in the history of the world. 


529 


As a result of the persistency with which this falsehood was repeated 
again and again to the masses of the people, millions of Germans saw in the 
Treaty of Versailles a just retribution for the crime we had committed at Brest- 
Litovsk. 


Thus they considered all opposition to Versailles as unjust and in many 
cases there was an honest moral dislike of such a proceeding. 


This was also the reason why the shameless and monstrous word 
‘reparations’ came into common use in Germany. This hypocritical falsehood 
appeared to millions of our exasperated fellow-countrymen as the merit of a 
higher justice. It is a terrible thought, but the fact was so. 


The best proof of this was the propaganda which I initiated against 
Versailles by explaining the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. I compared the two 
treaties, point by point, and showed how in truth the one treaty was immensely 
humane, in contradiction to the inhuman barbarity of the other. 


The effect was very striking. When I used to speak on this theme before 
an assembly of two thousand persons, I often saw three thousand six hundred 
hostile eyes fixed on me, yet three hours later I had in front of me a crowd 
swayed by righteous indignation and fury. 


A great lie had been uprooted from the hearts and brains of thousands of 
individuals and a truth had been implanted in its place. 


The two lectures that ‘On the Causes of the World War’ and the other on 
‘The Peace Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Versailles’, I then considered as the 
most important, of all. 


Therefore, I repeated them dozens of times, always giving them a new 
intonation, until, on those points at least, there reigned a definitely clear and 
unanimous opinion among those from whom our Movement recruited its first 
members. 


Furthermore, these gatherings, had for me the advantage that I slowly 
became a platform orator at mass meetings, and they gave me practice in the 
pathos and gesture required in large halls that held thousands of people. 


Apart from the small circles already mentioned, I could not discover that 
the slightest effort was being made by any party to explain things to the people 
in this way. 


530 


Not one of those parties was then active which talk to-day as if it were 
they who had brought about the change in public opinion. Ifa political leader, 
calling himself a nationalist, pronounced a discourse somewhere or other on 
this theme it was only to circles which were, for the most part already of his 
own conviction and among whom the most that was done was to confirm them 
in their opinions. 


But that was not what was needed then. What was needed was to win 
over through propaganda and explanation those who, by education and 
conviction, belonged to the enemy camp. 


The one-page circular was also adopted by us to help in this 
propaganda. While still a soldier I had written a circular in which I contrasted 
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with that of Versailles. 


That circular was printed and distributed in large numbers. Later on I 
used it for the Party, and also with good success. 


Our first meetings were distinguished by the fact that there were tables 
covered with leaflets, papers, and pamphlets of every kind, but we relied 
principally on the spoken word. 


And, indeed this is the only means capable of producing really great 
revolutions, which fact can be explained on general psychological grounds. 


In the first volume I have already stated that all the formidable events 
which have changed the aspect of the world were carried through, not by the 
written, but by the spoken word. 


On that point there was a long discussion in a certain section of the 
press, during the course of which our shrewd bourgeois people strongly 
opposed my thesis, but the reason for this attitude confounded the sceptics. 


The bourgeois intelligentsia protested against my attitude simply because 
they themselves did not have either the force or the ability to influence the 
masses through the spoken word, for they always relied exclusively on the help 
of writers and did not enter the arena themselves as orators for the purpose of 
arousing the people. 


This habit necessarily led to that condition of affairs which is 
characteristic of the bourgeoisie to-day, namely, the loss of the psychological 
instinct to work up and influence the masses. 


531 


An orator receives continuous guidance from the people whom he is 
addressing. This helps him to correct the trend of his speech, for he can always 
gauge, by the faces of his hearers, how far they follow and understand him, and 
whether his words are producing the desired effect. 


The writer, on the other hand, does not know his reader at all. Therefore, 
from the outset, he does not address himself to a definite group of persons 
which he has before him, but must write in a general way. 


Hence, to a certain extent he must fail in psychological finesse and 
flexibility. Therefore, in general it may be said that a brilliant orator writes 
better than a brilliant writer can speak, unless the latter has continual practice 
in public speaking. One must also remember that of itself the multitude is 
mentally inert. It clings to its old habits and is not naturally prone to read 
something which does not conform to its own pre-established beliefs or does 
not contain what it hopes to find there. Therefore, a piece of writing which has 
a particular tendency is for the most part read only by those who are in 
sympathy with it. Only a leaflet or a placard, on account of its brevity can hope 
to arouse a momentary interest in those whose opinions differ from it. 


The picture, in all its forms, including the film has better prospects. Here 
less intelligence is required on the part of the audience, it need only gaze, or at 
most read short captions or titles, and so it comes about that many people are 
more ready to accept a pictorial presentation than to read a long written 
description. 


A pictorial representation will convey to people much more quickly (one 
might almost say, immediately) an idea, to grasp which would require long and 
arduous effort if they were forced to read about it. 


The most important consideration, however, is that one never knows into 
what hands a piece of written material may fall and yet the form in which its 
subject is presented must remain the same. 


In general, the effect is greater when the form of treatment corresponds to 
the mental level of the reader and suits his nature. 


Therefore, a book which is meant for the broad masses of the people 
must try from the very start to gain its effects through a style and level of ideas 
which would be quite different from those of a book intended to be read by the 
higher intellectual classes. 


532 


Only through this capacity for adaptability does the force of the written 
word approach that of direct speech. The orator may deal with the same 
subject as a book deals with, but if he has the genius of a great and popular 
orator he will scarcely ever repeat the same argument or the same material in 
the same form on two consecutive occasions. 


He will always follow the lead of the great masses in such a way that 
from the living emotion of his hearers the apt word which he needs will be 
suggested to him and in its turn this will go straight to the hearts of his hearers. 


Should he make even a slight mistake he has the living correction before 
him. As I have already said, he can read the play of expression on the faces of 
his hearers, firstly to see if they understand what he says, secondly, to see if 
they take in the whole of his argument and, thirdly, to see 1n how far he has 
succeeded in convincing them of the justice of what he has, said. 


Should he observe, firstly, that his hearers do not understand him, he will 
make his explanation so elementary and clear that they will be able to grasp it, 
even to the last individual. 


Secondly, if he feels that they are not capable of following him he will 
make one idea follow another carefully and slowly until the most slow-witted 
hearer no, longer lags behind. 


Thirdly, as soon as he has the feeling that they do not seem convinced 
that he is right in the way he has put things to them he will repeat his argument 
over and over again, always giving fresh illustrations and he himself will state 
their unspoken objection. 


He will repeat these objections, dissecting them and refuting them, until 
the last group of the opposition shows him by its behaviour and play of 
expression that it has capitulated before his exposition of the case. 


Not infrequently it is a case of overcoming ingrained prejudices which 
are mostly unconscious and founded on sentiment rather than on reason. 


It is a thousand times more difficult to overcome, this barrier of 
instinctive aversion, emotional hatred and prejudice than to correct opinions 
which are founded on defective or erroneous knowledge. 


False ideas and ignorance may be set aside by means of instruction, but 
emotional resistance never can. Nothing but an appeal to these hidden forces 


533 


will be effective here, and that appeal, can be made by scarcely any writer. 
Only the orator can hope to make it. 


A very striking proof of this 1s found in the fact that, though we had a 
bourgeois press which, in many cases, was well written and produced and had 
a circulation of millions of copies, 1t could not prevent the broad masses from 
becoming the implacable enemies of the bourgeois class. 


The deluge of papers and books published by intellectual circles year 
after year passed over the minds of millions of the lower social strata as water 
runs off a duck’s back. 


This proves that one of two things must be true: either that the matter 
offered in the bourgeois press was worthless or that it is impossible to reach 
the hearts of the broad masses by means of the written word alone. 


Of course, the latter is essentially true when the written material betrays 
as little psychological insight as hitherto. 


It is useless to object here, as certain big Berlin papers of German 
Nationalist tendencies have attempted to do, that this statement is refuted by the 
fact that the Marxists have exercised their greatest influence through their 
writings and especially through their principal book, published by Karl Marx. 


Seldom has a more superficial attempt been made to support an argument 
based on a false assumption. What gave Marxism its amazing influence over 
the broad masses was not that formal printed work which sets forth the Jewish 
system of ideas, but the tremendous oral propaganda carried on for years 
among the masses. 


Out of one hundred thousand German workers scarcely one hundred 
know Marx’s book. It has been studied much more in intellectual circles and 
especially by the Jews than by the genuine followers of the movement who 
come from the lower classes. 


That work was not written for the masses, but exclusively for the 
intellects behind the Jewish machine for conquering the world. 


The engine was heated with quite different fuel, namely, the press. What 
differentiates the bourgeois press from the Marxist press is that the latter is 
written by agitators, whereas the bourgeois press would like to carry on 
agitation by means of professional writers. 


534 


The Social Democratic editor of some local ‘rag’, who almost always 
comes directly from the meeting to the editorial offices of his paper, knows his 
job to his finger-tips, but the bourgeois scribbler who wishes to appeal to the 
broad masses, feels faint if their stench but reach his delicate nostrils and so he 
is naturally powerless to touch them by his writings. 


What won over millions of work-people to the Marxist cause was not the 
ex cathedra style of the Marxist writers, but the strenuous propaganda work 
done by tens of thousands of indefatigable agitators, from the ardent agitator 
down to the insignificant trade-union official, the trusty employee and the 
heckler. 


Furthermore, there were the hundreds of thousands of meetings where 
these orators, standing on tables in smoky public houses, hammered their ideas 
into the heads of the masses, thus acquiring an admirable psychological 
knowledge of the human material they had to deal with, and in this way they 
were enabled to select the best weapons for their assault on the citadel of 
public opinion. 


In addition to all this there were the gigantic mass-demonstrations with 
processions in which a hundred thousand persons took part. All this was 
calculated to give the petty-hearted individual the proud conviction that, though 
a poor worm he was at the same time an integral part of the great dragon 
before whose devastating breath the hated bourgeois world would one day be 
consumed in fire and flame, and the dictatorship of the proletariat would 
celebrate its final victory. 


This kind of propaganda influenced men in such a way as to give thema 
taste for reading the Social Democratic press and prepare their minds for its 
teaching. 


That press, in its turn, was a vehicle of the spoken, rather than of the 
written, word. Whereas in the bourgeois camp professors and learned writers, 
theorists and authors of} all kinds, made attempts at speaking, in the Marxist 
camp real speakers often made attempts at writing. 


This applies especially to the Jew who, on account of his dialectical 
skill and cunning in distorting the truth, assumes even as an author rather the 
guise of an eloquent agitator than of a creative writer. 


For this reason the bourgeois press (quite apart from the fact that it is 


335 


dominated by the Jew and has, therefore, no interest in enlightening the broad 
masses) is not capable of exercising the slightest influence on the opinions held 
by the great masses of our people. It is difficult to eradicate emotional 
prejudices, psychological bias, feelings, etc., and to put others in their place. 
Success depends here on conditions and influences which cannot be gauged. 


Only the orator who is gifted with the most sensitive insight can estimate 
all this. Even the time of day at which the speech is delivered has a decisive 
influence on its effectiveness. 


The same speech, made by the same orator and on the same theme, will 
have very different results according as it is delivered at ten o’clock in the 
forenoon, at three in the afternoon, or in the evening. 


When I first engaged in public speaking I arranged for meetings to take 
place in the forenoon and I remember particularly a demonstration that we held 
in the Miinchner-KindIl-Keller as a protest against the oppression of German 
minorities. 


That was the biggest hall then in Munich and the risk appeared very 
great. In order to make the hour of the meeting suitable for all the members of 
our Movement and the other people who might come, I fixed it for ten o’clock 
on a Sunday morning. 


The result was depressing, but it was very instructive. The hall was 
filled. The impression was profound, but the general atmosphere was chilly. 
Nobody got warmed up and I myself, as the speaker of the occasion, felt 
profoundly unhappy at the thought that I could not establish the slightest contact 
with my audience. 


I do not think I spoke worse than on other occasions, but the effect 
seemed absolutely negative. I left the hall ina very depressed frame of mind, 
but also feeling that I had gained a new experience. Later on I tried the same 
kind of experiment, but always with the same results. 


That was not to be wondered at. If one goes to a theatre to see a matinee 
performance and, then attends an evening performance of the same play, one is 
astounded at the difference in the impression created. 


A sensitive person and one who is capable of analysing his own 
reactions, will readily acknowledge that the impression created by the matinee 
performance is by no means as vivid as that gained at the evening performance. 


536 


The same is true of cinema productions. 


This latter point is important; for one may say of the theatre that perhaps 
in the afternoon the actor does not make the same effort as in the evening, but 
surely it cannot be said that the cinema is different in the afternoon from what it 
is at nine o’clock in the evening. 


In this case, the time of day exercises a distinct influence, just as a room 
exercises a distinct influence on me. 


There are rooms which leave one cold, for reasons which are difficult to 
explain. There are rooms which steadfastly prevent the creation of an 
atmosphere of any sort. Moreover, certain memories and traditions which are 
present as pictures in the human mind may have a determining influence on the 
impression produced. 


Thus a performance of Parsifal at Bayreuth will have an effect quite 
different from that which the same opera produces in any other part of the 
world. 


The mysterious charm of the House on the ‘Festival Heights’ in the old 
city of the Margrave can neither be equalled nor conjured up by external 
surroundings in any other place. 


In all these cases one is dealing with the problem of influencing the 
freedom of the human will, and that is true especially of meetings where there 
are men whose wills are opposed to the speaker and who must be brought 
round to a new way of thinking. 


In the morning and during the day it seems that the rower of the human 
will rebels most strongly against any attempt to impose upon it the will or 
opinion of another. On the other hand, in the evening it easily succumbs to the 
domination of a stronger will, because actually in such assemblies there is a 
contest between two opposing forces. 


The superior oratorical art of a man who has the compelling character of 
an apostle will succeed better in bringing round to a new way of thinking those 
who have, in the course of nature, been subjected to a weakening of their 
forces of resistance rather than in converting those who are in full possession 
of their volitional and intellectual faculties. 


The mysterious artificial dimness of the Catholic churches, the burning 


537 


candles, the incense, the thurible, etc. also serve this purpose. 


In this struggle between the orator and the opponent whom he must 
convert to his cause, the former gradually acquires an awareness of the 
psychological fitness of his propaganda weapons, which the writer seldom 
possesses. 


Generally speaking, the effect of the writer’s work helps rather to 
conserve, reinforce and deepen the foundations of opinions already formed. 


All really great historical revolutions were not produced by the written 
word; at most, they were accompanied by it. 


It is out of the question to think that the French Revolution could have 
been carried into effect by philosophising theories had it not been for an army 
of agitators headed by demagogues of a pronounced type who inflamed popular 
passion that had been already aroused, until that volcanic eruption finally 
broke out which convulsed the whole of Europe. 


The same ts true of the greatest revolutionary movement of our own day, 
namely, the Bolshevist Revolution in Russia, which was not the outcome of 
Lenin’s writings, but of the oratorical activities of innumerable agitators, great 
and small, who stirred up hatred. 


The masses of illiterate Russians were not fired to communist 
revolutionary enthusiasm by reading the theories of Karl Marx, but by the 
promises of paradise made to the people by thousands of agitators in the 
service of a single idea. It has always been so, and it always will be so. 


It is typical of our pig-headed intellectuals, who live apart from the 
practical world, to think that a writer must of necessity be superior in 
intelligence to an orator. 


This point of view was once effectively illustrated by a critique, 
published in a certain national paper which I have already mentioned, where it 
was stated that one 1s often disillusioned by reading the speech of an 
acknowledged great orator in print. 


That reminded me of another article which fell into my hands during the 
War. It dealt with the speeches of Lloyd George, who was then Minister of 
Munitions, and examined them in a painstaking way under the microscope of 
criticism. 


538 


The writer made the brilliant statement that these speeches showed 
inferior intelligence and learning and that, moreover, they were banal and 
commonplace productions. 


I happened to get hold of some of these speeches, published in pamphlet 
form, and had to laugh at the fact that an ordinary German quill-driver did not 
in the least understand these psychological masterpieces in the art of 
influencing the masses. 


This man criticised these speeches solely according to the impression 
they made on his own arrogant mind, whereas the one aim of the great British 
demagogue was to produce the maximum effect upon his audiences and, in the 
widest sense, on the lower classes throughout the length and breadth of, 
Britain. 


Looked at from this point of view, that British statesman’s speeches were 
most wonderful achievements, precisely because they showed an astounding 
knowledge of the mentality of the broad masses of the people. For that reason 
their effect was really overwhelming. 


Compare with them the futile stammerings of a Bethmann-Hollweg. On 
the surface the latter’s speeches were undoubtedly more intellectual, but they 
actually proved the man’s inability to speak to his own people, whom he did 
not understand. 


Nevertheless to the stupid average brain of the German writer, who had, 
of course amassed a great deal of learning, it seemed only natural to judge the 
speeches of the British statesman—which were made for the purpose of 
influencing the masses—by the impression which they made on his own mind, 
fossilised as it was by learning and to compare them to the brilliant but futile 
talk of the German statesman, which of course had a greater appeal for him. 


That the genius of Lloyd George was not only equal, but a thousandfold 
superior to that of a Bethmann-Hollweg, is proved by the fact that he found for 
his speeches that form and expression which opened the hearts of his people to 
him and made that people carry out his will absolutely. 


The primitive quality of these speeches, the originality of his 
expressions, his choice of clear and simple illustration, prove the superior 
political capacity of the British spokesman. 


One must never judge the speech of a statesman to his people by the 


539 


impression which it leaves on the mind of a university professor, but by the 
effect it produces on the public, and this is the sole criterion of the orator’s 
genius. 


The astonishing development of our Movement, which was created out 
of nothing a few years ago and 1s to-day singled out for persecution by all the 
internal and external enemies of our nation, must be attributed to the constant 
recognition and practical application of those principles. 


However important the literature of the Movement may be, it is, 
nevertheless, at present more important as a means of providing leaders of the 
upper, as well as of the lower grades, with a uniform course of instruction, 
than for the purpose of converting antagonistic masses. 


It was only in very rare cases that a convinced and devoted Social 
Democrat or Communist was induced to gain an insight into our 
Weltanschauung or to study a criticism of his own by procuring and reading 
one of our pamphlets or even one of our books. 


Even a newspaper is rarely read if it does not bear the stamp of party 
opinions. Moreover, the reading of newspapers helps little, because the 
general picture given by a single number of a newspaper is so confused and 
produces such a fragmentary impression that it really does not influence the 
occasional reader. 


Where a man has to count his pennies, it cannot be assumed that, 
exclusively for the purpose of being objectively informed, he will become a 
regular reader or subscriber to a paper which opposes his views. Scarcely one 
man in ten thousand will do this. 


Only after he has already joined a movement will he regularly read the 
party organ of that movement, more especially for the purpose of keeping 
himself informed of what is happening in the movement. 


It is quite different with the ‘spoken’ leaflet. Especially if it be 
distributed gratis it will be taken up by one person or another, all the more 
willingly if its display title refers to a question about which everybody is 
talking at the moment. 


Perhaps someone after having read through such a leaflet more or less 
carefully, will have his eyes opened to the existence of new points of view, a 
new mental attitude, and even a new movement. 


540 


But, at best, this will only serve as a slight impulse and will not 
establish a firm conviction, because the leaflet can do no more than arouse 
interest and attract attention, and can only be effective if the reader 
subsequently gains more definite and thorough information, the only road to 
which is via the mass meeting. 


Mass meetings are also necessary for the reason that, in attending them, 
the individual who, about to join the new movement, feels himself alone and is 
easily scared of acting singularly acquires for the first time the feeling of a 
great community, which has a strengthening and encouraging effect on most 
people. 


The same man will, as a member of a company or battalion, surrounded 
by his companions, march with a lighter heart to the attack than if he had to 
march alone. In the crowd he feels himself in some way sheltered, though in 
reality there are a thousand arguments against such a feeling. 


Mass demonstrations on a grand scale not only reinforce the will of the 
individual, but they draw him still closer to the movement and help to create an 
esprit de corps. 


The man who appears as the first representative of a new doctrine in his 
place of business or in his factory is bound to have to face obstacles and has 
need of that strength which comes from the consciousness that he is a member 
of a great community, and only a mass demonstration can impress upon him the 
greatness of this community. 


If, on leaving the shop or mammoth factory, in which he feels very small 
indeed, he enters a cast assembly for the first time and sees around him 
thousands upon thousands of men who hold the same opinions; 


- if, while still seeking his way, he is gripped by the force of mass 
suggestion which comes from the excitement and enthusiasm of three or four 
thousand other men in whose midst he finds himself; and 


- if the manifest success and the consensus of thousands confirm the truth 
and justice of the new teaching and for the first time raise in his mind doubt as 
to the truth of the opinions held by himself up to now, then he submits himself 
to the fascination of what we call mass suggestion. 


The will, the yearning and indeed the strength of thousands of people are 
in each individual. A man who enters such a meeting in doubt and hesitation 


541 


leaves it inwardly fortified; he has become a member of a community. 


The National Socialist Movement should never forget this, and it should 
never allow itself to be influenced by those bourgeois blockhead, who think 
they know everything, but who have foolishly gambled away a great State, 
together with their own existence and the supremacy of their own class. 


They are extraordinarily clever, they can do everything, and they know 
everything, but there was one thing which they failed to do, namely, to save the 
German people from falling into the clutches of Marxism. 


In that they failed miserably and their present high opinion of their 
prowess is mere conceit, for their pride and their stupidity are fruits of the 
same tree. 


If these people try to disparage the importance of the spoken word to- 
day, they do it only because they realise—God be praised—how futile all their 
own speechifying has been. 


542

544 


CHAPTER VII: THE STRUGGLE WITH THE REDS 


In 1919-20 and also in 1921 I attended some of the bourgeois meetings. 
Invariably I had the same feeling towards these as towards the compulsory 
dose of castor 011 in my boyhood days. 


It had to be taken because it was good for one, but it certainly tasted 
unpleasant. If it were possible to tie ropes round the German people and 
forcibly drag them to these bourgeois ‘meetings’, to keep them there behind 
barred doors and to allow nobody to escape until the meeting closed, then this 
procedure might prove successful in the course of a few hundred years. 


For my own part I must frankly admit that, in such circumstances, I 
should not find life worth living and indeed I should no longer wish to be a 
German. 


But, thank God, all that is impossible, and so it is not surprising that the 
sane and unspoilt masses shun these ‘bourgeois mass meetings’ as the devil 
shuns holy water. 


I came to know the prophets of the bourgeois Weltanschauung, and I was 
not surprised at what I learned, as I knew that they attached little importance to 
the spoken word. 


At that time, I attended meetings of the Democrats, the German 
Nationalists, the German People’s Party and the Bavarian People’s Party (the 
Centre Party of Bavaria). 


What struck me at once was the homogeneous uniformity of the 
audiences. Nearly always they were made up exclusively of party members. 


The whole affair was more like a yawning card party than an assembly 
of people who had just passed through a great revolution. 


The speakers did all they could to maintain this tranquil atmosphere. 
They declaimed, or rather read out, their speeches in the style of an intellectual 
newspaper article or a learned treatise, avoiding all forcible expressions. 


Here and there a feeble professorial joke would be introduced, 
whereupon the people sitting at the speaker’s table felt themselves obliged to 
laugh—not loudly or infectiously, but with well-bred reserve. 


545 


Oh, those people at the speaker’s table! I once attended a meeting in the 
Wagner Hall in Munich. It was a demonstration to celebrate the anniversary of 
the Battle of Leipzig. The speech was delivered, or rather read out, by a 
venerable old professor from one or other of the universities. 


The committee sat on the platform: one monocle on the right, another 
monocle on the left, and in the centre a gentleman with no monocle. 


All three of them were punctiliously attired in morning dress, and I had 
the impression of being present in a court of justice just as the death-sentence 
was about to be pronounced or at a christening or some more solemn religious 
ceremony. 


The so-called speech, which in printed form may have read quite well, 
had a disastrous effect. After three-quarters of an hour the audience fell into a 
sort of hypnotic trance, which was interrupted only when some man or woman 
left the hall, or by the clatter which the waitresses made, or by the increased 
yawning of members of the audience. 


I had posted myself behind three workmen who were present either out 
of curiosity or because they were sent there by their parties. 


From time to time they glanced at one another with an ill-concealed grin, 
nudged one another with their elbows and then silently left the hall. One could 
see that they had no intention whatsoever of interrupting the proceedings, nor 
indeed was it necessary to do so. 


At long last the proceedings showed signs of drawing to a close. After 
the professor, whose voice had meanwhile become more and more inaudible, 
had finally ended his speech the gentleman without the monocle delivered a 
rousing peroration to the assembled ‘German sisters and brethren.’ 


On behalf of the audience and himself he expressed his thanks for the 
magnificent lecture which they had just heard from Professor X and 
emphasised how deeply the Professor’s words had moved them all. 


If a general discussion on the lecture were to take place it would be 
tantamount to profanity, and he thought he was voicing the opinion of all 
present in suggesting that such a discussion should not be held. 


Therefore, he would ask the assembly to rise from their seats and join in 
singing the patriotic song, Wir Binden Einig Volk von Briidern. 


546 


The proceedings finally closed with the singing of the anthem, 
Deutschland tiber Alles. It appeared to me that when the second verse was 
reached the voices were fewer and that only when the refrain was reached did 
they swell louder. 


When we reached the third verse my suspicion that a good many of those 
present were not very familiar with the text was confirmed. But what does that 
matter when such a song is sung whole-heartedly and fervidly by an assembly 
of German Nationalists? 


After this the meeting broke up and everyone hurried to get outside, one 
to his glass of beer, one to a cafe, and others simply into the fresh air. 


Out into the fresh air! That was also my one desire. Was this the way to 
commemorate a heroic struggle in which hundreds of thousands of Prussians 
and Germans had fought? 


No, a thousand times no! That sort of thing might find favour with the 
Government, it being merely a ‘peaceful’ meeting. 


The minister responsible for law and order had no need to fear that 
enthusiasm might suddenly get the better of public decorum and induce these 
people to pour out of the room and, instead of dispersing to public houses and 
cafés, march four abreast through the town singing Deutschland hoch in Ehren 
and causing some unpleasantness to a police force in need of sleep. 


He had reason to be well satisfied with this type of citizen. On the other 
hand, the National Socialist meetings were by no means ‘peaceable’ affairs. 


Two distinct Weltanschauungen raged in bitter opposition to one 
another, and these meetings did not close with the mechanical rendering of a 
dull patriotic song, but rather with a passionate outbreak of popular national 
feeling. 


It was imperative from the start to introduce rigid discipline into our 
meetings and establish the authority of the chairman absolutely. 


Our purpose was not to pour out a mixture of soft-soap bourgeois talk; 
what we had to say was meant to arouse the opponents at our meetings! 


How often did they not turn up in large numbers with a few agitators 
among them ready, judging by the expression on all their faces, to finish us off 


547 


there and then. 


How often did they turn up in strength, those supporters of the Red Flag, 
having been previously instructed to smash up everything once and for all, and 
put an end to our meetings. 


More often than not everything hung in the balance, and only the 
chairman’s ruthless determination and the rough handling by our hall-guards 
baffled our adversaries ‘intentions’. They had every reason to be irritated. 


The fact that we had chosen red as the colour for our posters sufficed to 
attract them to our meeting. The ordinary bourgeoisie were very shocked to see 
that we had also chosen the symbolic red of Bolshevism and they regarded this 
as something ambiguously significant. 


It was whispered in German Nationalist circles that we also were 
merely another variety of Marxists, perhaps even Marxists suitably disguised, 
or better still, Socialists. 


The actual difference between Socialism and Marxism still remains a 
mystery to these people to this day. The charge of Marxism was conclusively 
proved when it was discovered that at our meetings we deliberately substituted 
the word ‘compatriots’ for ‘Ladies and Gentlemen’ and addressed each other 
as ‘Party Comrade.’ 


We used to roar with laughter at these silly faint-hearted bourgeois and 
their efforts to puzzle out our origin, our intentions and our aims. 


We chose red for our posters after careful deliberation, our intention 
being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come 
to our meetings—f only in order to break them up—so that it this way we 
might have a chance of talking to the people. 


In those years it was indeed a delightful experience to follow the 
constantly changing tactics of our perplexed and helpless adversaries. 


First of all, they appealed to their followers to ignore us and keep away 
from our meetings. Generally speaking, this appeal was heeded. But, as time 
went on, more and more of their followers gradually found their way to us and 
accepted our teaching. 


Then the leaders became nervous and, uneasy. They clung to their belief 


548 


that such a development should not be ignored forever, and that force must be 
applied in order to put an end to it. 


Appeals were then made to the ‘class-conscious proletariat’ to attend our 
meetings in masses and strike with the clenched hand of the proletarian at the 
representatives of a ‘monarchist and reactionary agitation.’ 


Our meetings suddenly became packed with work-people fully three- 
quarters of an hour before the proceedings were scheduled to begin. These 
gatherings resembled a powder cask ready to explode at any moment, and the 
fuse was conveniently at hand. 


But things always turned out differently. People came as enemies and 
left, not perhaps prepared to join us, yet in a reflective mood and disposed to 
examine critically the correctness of their own doctrine. 


Gradually, as time went on, my three-hour lectures resulted in supporters 
and opponents becoming, united in one single enthusiastic group of people. 
Every signal for the breaking up of the meeting failed. 


The result was that the opposition leaders became more frightened and 
once again looked for help from those quarters that had formerly 
discountenanced these tactics and, with some show of right, had been of the 
opinion that on principle the workers should be forbidden to attend our 
meetings. 


Thereafter, they did not come any more, or only in small numbers, but 
after a short time the whole game began again. The instructions to keep away 
from us were ignored, the comrades came in steadily increasing numbers, until 
finally the advocates of the radical tactics won the day. 


We were to be broken up. Yet when, after two, three and even many 
meetings, it was realised that to break up these gatherings was easier said than 
done and that every meeting resulted in a decisive weakening of the Red, 
fighting forces, the other cry was taken up again, ‘Proletarians and comrades, 
avoid the meetings of the National Socialist agitators.’ 


The same eternally alternating tactics were also to be observed in the 
Red press. At one time they tried to silence us, but discovered the uselessness 
of such an attempt. After that they swung round to the opposite tactics. Daily 
‘reference’ was made to us solely for the purpose of ridiculing us in the eyes 
of the working classes. 


549 


After a time these gentlemen must have felt that no harm was being done 
to us, but that, on the contrary, we were reaping an advantage in that people 
were asking themselves why so much space was being devoted to a subject 
which was supposed to be so futile. 


People became curious. Suddenly, there was a change of tactics and for a 
time we were treated as veritable criminals against mankind. 


One article followed another, in which our criminal intentions were 
explained and fresh proofs brought forward in support of what was said. 


Scandalous tales, all of them fabricated from start to finish, were 
published in order to help to poison the public mind, but in a short time even 
these attacks also proved unavailing and in fact they were of material 
assistance to us because they attracted public attention to us. 


In those days I took up the standpoint that it was immaterial whether they 
laughed at us or reviled us, whether they depicted us as fools or criminals; the 
important point was that they took notice of us and that in the eyes of the 
working classes we came to be regarded as the only force capable of putting 


up a fight. 


I said that we would one day show the rabble that was the Jewish press 
what we really were and what we were really aiming at. 


One reason why they never got so far as breaking up our meetings was 
undoubtedly the incredible cowardice displayed by the leaders of the 
opposition. 


On every critical occasion they left the dirty work to the smaller fry 
whilst they waited outside the halls for the results of the break-up. 


We were nearly always well-informed of our opponents’ intentions, not 
only because we allowed several of our party colleagues to remain members 
of the Red organisations for reasons of expediency, but also because the Red 
wire-pullers, were, most luckily for us, afflicted with a degree of talkativeness 
that is still unfortunately very prevalent among Germans. 


They could not keep their own counsel, and more often than not they 
started cackling before the proverbial egg was laid. Hence, time and again, we 
were able to take such far-reaching precautionary measures that the ‘Reds’ 
who had been told off to break up our meeting had no inkling that they were 


550 


about to be ejected. 


This state of affairs compelled us to take the work of safeguarding our 
meetings into our own hands. No reliance could be placed on the protection of 
the authorities, on the contrary, experience showed that it was the disturbing 
element which gained by such intervention. The only real outcome of police 
intervention was that the meeting would be dissolved, which was precisely 
what our opponents wanted. Generally speaking, this led the police to adopt a 
method of procedure which, to say the least of it, was a most infamous example 
of official malpractice. 


The moment they received information of a threat that some meeting was 
to be broken up, instead of arresting the would-be disturbers, they promptly 
forbade the non-guilty party to hold the meeting, this being a measure which 
appealed to the average police mentality as the climax of wisdom. This step 
the police proclaimed to be a ‘precautionary measure in the interests of law 
and order.’ 


The political work and activities of decent people could, therefore, 
always be hindered by any desperate ruffians who had the means at their 
disposal. 


In the name of law and order State authority bowed down to these 
ruffians and demanded that others should not provoke them. 


When the National Socialists desired to hold meetings in certain places 
and the trade-unions declared that their members would resist, then it was not 
the blackmailers that were arrested and gaoled. 


On the contrary, our meetings were forbidden by the police. In fact, the 
strong arm of the law had the unspeakable impudence to advise us in writing to 
this effect on innumerable occasions. 


To avoid such eventualities it was necessary to see to it that every 
attempt to disturb a meeting was nipped in the bud. 


Another feature to be taken into account in this respect is that all 
meetings which rely on police protection must necessarily bring discredit to 
their promoters in the eyes of the general public. 


Meetings that can be held only with the protective assistance of a strong 
force of police convert nobody, because in order to win over the lower strata 


551 


of the people there must be a visible show of strength on one’s own side. 


In the same way that a man of courage will win a woman’s affection 
more easily than a coward, so a fearless movement will be more successful in 
winning the hearts of a people than a weak movement which relies on police 
support for its very existence. 


It is for this latter reason in particular that our young Party had to assume 
the full responsibility of safeguarding its own existence, defending itself and 
foiling the terrorist tactics of its opponents. 


The measures adopted for the protection of our meetings were as 
follows: Firstly, energetic and judicious conduct of the meeting. 


Secondly, the organisation of a squad of men to maintain order. In those 
days, we and no one else were masters of the situation at our meetings, and on 
no occasion did we fail to emphasise this. 


Our opponents fully realised that any provocation would be a signal to 
have them thrown out of the hall at once whatever the odds against us. At 
meetings, particularly outside Munich, we had in those days from five to eight 
hundred opponents to fifteen or sixteen National Socialists; yet we brooked no 
interference for our opponents knew full well that we were prepared to die 
rather than capitulate. 


More than once a handful of party members offered a heroic resistance to 
a raging and violent mob of Reds. Those fifteen or twenty men would certainly 
have been overwhelmed in the end had not the opponents known that three or 
four times as many of themselves would first get their skulls cracked, and that 
risk they were not willing to run. 


We had done our best to study the Marxist and bourgeois methods of 
conducting meetings, and we had certainly learnt something. 


The Marxists had always exercised a most rigid discipline so that the 
question of breaking up their meetings could never have originated in 
bourgeois quarters. 


The more, therefore, did the Reds concentrate on these tactics. In time 
they not only became past masters in this art, but in certain large districts of the 
Reich they went so far as to declare that non-Marxist meetings were nothing 
less than a cause of provocation to the proletariat. 


552 


This was particularly the case when the wire-pullers suspected that a 
meeting might call attention to their own transgressions and thus expose their 
own treachery and chicanery. 


Therefore, the moment such a meeting was announced, a howl of rage 
went up from the Red press. They, who despised the law on principle, nearly 
always appealed in the first instance to the authorities and requested in 
imperative and threatening language that this ‘provocation of the proletariat’ be 
stopped forthwith in the ‘interests of law and order.’ 


Their language was chosen according to the importance of the official 
blockhead with whom they were dealing and thus success was assured. 


If by chance the official happened to be a true German—and not a mere 
figurehead—and he did not comply with the impudent request, then the well- 
known appeal to stop ‘provocation of the proletariat’ was issued together with 
instructions to attend such and such a meeting on a certain date in full strength 
for the purpose of ‘putting a stop to the disgraceful machinations of the 
bourgeoisie by means of the proletarian fist.’ 


The pitiful and frightened manner in which these bourgeois meetings 
were conducted had to be seen to be believed. Very frequently these threats 
were sufficient to make them call off such a meeting at once. 


The feeling of fear was so marked that the meeting, instead of 
commencing at eight o’clock, very seldom opened before a quarter to nine or 
nine o’clock. 


The chairman thereupon did his best, by showering compliments on the 
‘gentlemen of the opposition’ to prove how he and all others present were 
pleased (a palpable lie) to welcome the presence of men who were not as yet 
in sympathy with them, for the reason that only by mutual discussion (to which 
he hereby gave his consent) could they be brought closer together in mutual 
understanding. 


Apart from this the chairman also assured them that the meeting had no 
intention whatsoever of interfering with anybody’s professed conviction. Far 
from it. Everyone had the right to form and hold his own political views, but he 
should allow others to do likewise. 


He, therefore, requested that the speaker be allowed to deliver his 
speech without interruption—the speech in any case not being a long affair— 


553 


so that this meeting should not provide the world with the spectacle of yet 
another shameful instance of the bitter fraternal strife raging in Germany. And 
so on and so forth. 


The brethren of the Left had little, if any, sympathy with that sort of talk; 
the speaker had hardly commenced when he was shouted down. One gained the 
impression at times that these speakers were grateful to the Fate which 
peremptorily cut short their martyr-like discourse. 


These bourgeois toreadors left the arena amidst a vast uproar, that is to 
say, if they escaped being thrown down the stairs with cracked skulls, as was 
very often the case. 


Therefore, our methods of organisation at National Socialist meetings 
were something quite strange to the Marxists. They came to our meetings in the 
belief that the little game which they had so often played successfully could, as 
a matter of course, be repeated on us. 


“To-day we shall finish them off.’ How often did they baw] this out to 
each other on entering the meeting hall, only to be thrown out with lightning 
speed before they had time to repeat it! 


In the first place, our method of conducting a meeting was entirely 
different. We did not crave permission to be allowed to speak, and we did not 
straightaway give everybody the right to hold endless discussions. 


We curtly gave everyone to understand that we were masters of the 
meeting and that we could, therefore, do as we pleased and that everyone who 
dared to interrupt would be unceremoniously thrown out. 


We stated clearly our refusal to accept responsibility for anyone treated 
in this manner. If time permitted, and if it suited us, a discussion would take 
place. Party member so-and-so would now speak. 


That kind of talk was sufficient in itself to astonish the Marxists. 


Secondly, we had at our disposal a well-trained and organised body of 
men for maintaining order at our meetings. 


On the other hand, the bourgeois parties protected their meetings with a 
body of men better classified as ushers who, by virtue of their age, thought they 
were entitled to authority and respect, but as the Marxist-taught mob had no 


554 


respect either for age or authority, protective measures at the bourgeois 
meetings were practically non-existent. 


When our political meetings first started I made it a special point to 
organise a suitable defensive squad composed, as a matter of principle, solely 
of young men. 


Some of them were ex-service men who had seen active service with 
me. Others were young party members who, right from the start, had been 
trained to realise that terrorism can be combated only by terrorism, that only 
courageous and determined people had made a success of things in this world. 
Finally, they knew that we were fighting for an ideal so lofty that, it was worth 
the last drop of our blood. 


These young men had been trained to realise that where force replaced 
common sense in the solution of a problem, the best means of defence was 
attack and that the reputation of our hall-guard squads should stamp us as a 
political fighting force and not as a debating society. 


It was extraordinary how eagerly those boys of the war-generation 
responded to this order. They had indeed good reason to be bitterly 
disappointed and indignant at the miserable milksop methods employed by the 
bourgeoisie. 


Thus it became clear to everyone that the Revolution had only been 
possible thanks to the dastardly methods of a bourgeois government. 


At that time there was certainly no lack of man-power to suppress the 
revolution, but unfortunately there was an entire lack of an organising brain. 


How often did the eyes of my young men light up with enthusiasm when I 
explained to them the vital functions connected with their task. I assured them 
time and again that all earthly wisdom is useless unless it be supported and 
protected by force; that the gentle goddess of Peace can only walk in company 
with the god of War; and that every great measure performed in the name of 
Peace must be protected and furthered by means of force. 


In this way the idea of military service appeared to them in a far more 
realistic light—not in the fossilised sense of decrepit officials serving the dead 
authority of a dead State—but in the living realisation of the duty of each man 
to sacrifice his life for his country at any given time and in any given place. 


555 


All honour to those young men for the way in which they performed their 
duty! Like a swarm of hornets they tackled disturbers at our meetings, 
regardless of superiority of numbers, however great, indifferent to wounds and 
bloodshed, inspired with the great idea of blazing a trail for the sacred mission 
of our Movement. 


As early as the summer of 1920 the organisation of squads of men as 
hall-guards for the purpose of maintaining order at our meetings was gradually 
assuming definite shape. 


By the spring of 1921 this body of men was sectioned off into squads of 
one hundred which, in turn, were subdivided into smaller groups. The urgency 
for this was apparent, as meanwhile the number of our meetings had steadily 
increased. 


We still frequently met in the Munich Hofbrauhaus, but more frequently 
in larger meeting halls throughout the city. In the autumn and winter of 1920-21 
our meetings in the Burgerbrau and Miinchener-Kindl-Keller had assumed vast 
proportions and the same thing always happened, namely, that the National 
Socialist German Labour Party meetings were always crowded out so that the 
police were compelled to close and bar the doors long before the proceedings 
commenced. 


The organisation of hall-guards to keep order at our meetings cleared up 
a very difficult question. Up till then the Movement had possessed no party 
badge and no party flag. 


The lack of these tokens was not only a disadvantage at that time, but 
was bound to prove intolerable in the future. The disadvantages were chiefly 
that members of the Party possessed no outward token of membership which 
linked them together and it was absolutely unthinkable that for the future they 
should remain without some token which would be a symbol of the Movement 
and could be set against that of the International. 


More than once in my youth the psychological importance of such a 
symbol had become clearly evident to me and froma sentimental point of view 
also it was advisable. 


In Berlin, after the War, I was present at a mass demonstration of 
Marxists in the Lustgarten in front of the Royal Palace. A sea of red flags, red 
armlets and red flowers was in itself sufficient to give that huge assembly of 


556 


about one hundred and twenty thousand persons an outward appearance of 
strength. 


I was now able to feel and understand how easily the man in the street 
succumbs to the hypnotic magic of such a grandiose piece of theatrical 
demonstration. 


The bourgeoisie, which, politically speaking, neither possessed nor 
championed any Weltanschauung, had, therefore, no banner of its own. Its 
parties were composed of ‘patriots’ who appropriated the colours of the 
Reich. 


Had these colours been the symbol of a definite Weltanschauung then 
one could understand the rulers of the State regarding this flag as expressive of 
their own Weltanschauung, seeing that through their efforts the symbol of their 
Weltanschauung had become the emblem of the Reich. 


This was, however, not the case. The Reich was welded together without 
the aid of the German bourgeoisie and the flag itself was born of the War and 
was, therefore, merely a State emblem possessing no significance in the sense 
of any particular ideological mission. 


Only in one part of the German-speaking territory in German Austria was 
there anything like a bourgeois party flag in existence. Here a section of the 
national bourgeoisie selected the 1848 colours (black, red and gold) as their 
party flag and then they created a symbol which, though of no significance from 
the point of view of a Weltanschauung, had, nevertheless, a revolutionary 
character from a national political point of view. 


The most bitter opponents of this flag at that time (and this should not be 
forgotten to-day) were the Social Democrats and the Christian Socialists or the 
clergy. 


They it was, in particular, who degraded and besmirched these colours 
just as in 1918 they dragged black, white and red in the gutter. Of course, the 
black, red and gold of the German parties in the old Austria were the colours 
of the year 1848; that is to say, of a period likely to be regarded as somewhat 
visionary, but it was a period that had honest Germans as its representatives, 
although the Jews were lurking unseen as wire-pullers in the background. 


It was the act of high treason and the shameful bartering of the German 
people and German territory that first of all made these colours so attractive to 


53] 


the Marxists and the Centre Party; so much so, that to-day they revere them as 
their most cherished possession and found their own associations for the 
protection of the flag they once foully besmirched. 


It is a fact, therefore, that, up to 1920, there was no flag that could have 
stood for a Weltanschauung diametrically opposed to Marxism. 


For even if the better political elements among the German bourgeoisie 
were loath to accept the suddenly discovered black, red and gold colours as 
their symbol after the year 1918, they were nevertheless incapable of 
countering this with a programme of their own for the future. At last, they had a 
reconstruction of the old Reich in mind. 


It is to this way of thinking that the black, white and red colours of the 
old Reich are indebted for their resurrection as the flag of our so-called 
national bourgeois parties. 


It is obvious that the emblem of a regime which had been, overthrown by 
the Marxists in inglorious circumstances is not now worthy to serve as a 
banner under which the same Marxism 1s to be crushed in its turn. 


However much any honourable German may love and revere those old 
colours, glorious in their youthful freshness, if he has fought under them and 
seen the sacrifice of so many lives; they can never serve as an emblem for the 
struggle of the future. 


In our Movement I have always adopted the attitude that it was a really 
lucky thing for the German nation that it had lost its old flag. This attitude of 
mine was in strong contrast to that of the bourgeois politicians. 


It may be immaterial to us what the Republic does under its flag, but let 
us be deeply grateful to Fate for having so graciously spared the most glorious 
war flag of all time from becoming an ignominious rag. The Reich of to-day, 
which has sold itself and its people, must never be allowed to adopt the 
honourable and heroic black, white and red colours. As long as the November 
outrage endures, that outrage may continue to bear its own external sign and not 
steal that of an honourable past. Our bourgeois politicians should awaken their 
consciences to the fact that whoever desires this State to adopt the black, white 
and red colours is pilfering the past. 


The old flag was suitable only for the old Reich and, thank Heaven, the 
Republic chose the colours best suited to itself. 


558 


This was also the reason why we National Socialists recognised that to 
hoist the old colours would not be symbolic of our special aims, for we had no 
wish to resurrect from the dead the old Reich which had been ruined through 
its own blunders, but to build up a new State. 


The Movement which is fighting Marxism to-day along these lines must 
display on its banner the symbol of the new State. 


The question of the new flag, that is to say, the form and appearance it 
must take, gave us much food for thought in those days. 


Suggestions poured in from all sides, which although well-meant were 
not suitable. The new flag had not only to be a symbol expressing our own 
struggle but, on the other hand, it was necessary that it should prove effective 
as a large poster. 


All those who have to consider the tastes of the public will recognise 
and appreciate the great importance of these apparently petty details. 


In hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the 
first thing to awaken interest in a movement. For this reason we declined all 
suggestions from various quarters for the identification of our Movement, by 
means of a white flag, with the old State or rather with those decrepit parties 
whose sole political objective was the restoration of past conditions. 


Apart from this, white is not a colour capable of attracting and focussing 
public attention. It is a colour suitable only for temperance associations and 
not for a movement that stands for reform in a revolutionary period. 


Black was also suggested—certainly well-suited to the times, but 
embodying no significance expressive of the will behind our Movement. 
Moreover, black is incapable of attracting attention. 


White and blue were discarded, despite their admirable aesthetic appeal 
as being the colours of an individual German federal state—a state that, 
unfortunately, through its political attitude of particularist narrow-mindedness 
did not enjoy a good reputation. 


In addition, with these colours it would have been difficult to attract 
attention to our Movement. The same applies to black and white. Black, red 
and gold did not come into consideration; neither, for the reasons already 
mentioned, did black, white and red—at least not in the form hitherto in use. 


559 


But the effectiveness of these three colours is far superior to all others 
and they are certainly the most strikingly harmonious combination. 


I myself was always for keeping the old colours, not only because I, as a 
soldier, regarded them as my most sacred possession, but because in their 
aesthetic effect they are, more than any others, symbolic of my personal 
sentiments. 


Accordingly, I had to discard all the innumerable suggestions and 
designs which had been proposed for the new Movement, among which were 
many that had incorporated the swastika in a design with the old colours. 


I, as leader, was unwilling to make public my own design, as it was 
possible that someone else would come forward with a design just as good, if 
not better, than my own. 


As a matter of fact, a dental surgeon from Starnberg submitted a good 
design very similar to mine, with only one mistake, namely, that upon a white 
ground he set a swastika with curved limbs. 


After innumerable trials I decided upon a final form—a flag of red 
material with a white disc bearing in its centre a black swastika. After many 
attempts I obtained the correct proportions between the dimensions of the flag 
and that of the white central disc, as well as of the swastika. This design was 
finally adopted. 


At the same time, we immediately ordered corresponding armlets for our 
squad of men who kept order at meetings, armlets of red material bearing a 
white disc with the black swastika upon it. 


A party badge was designed on the same lines, namely, a white disc ona 
red ground bearing the swastika in the centre. Herr Fuss, a Munich goldsmith, 
supplied the first practical and permanent design for this. 


The new flag made its first appearance in public in the summer of 1920. 
It suited out Movement admirably, both being new and young. Not a soul had 
seen this flag before and its effect at that time was something akin to that of a 
flaming torch. 


We ourselves experienced almost a boyish thrill when one of the 
women-members of the Party who had been entrusted with the making of the 
flag finally handed it over to us. 


560 


A few months later we in Munich possessed six of these flags. The 
steadily increasing strength of our hall-guards was a main factor in 
popularizing the symbol, for it, became a symbol in the truest sense of the 
word. 


By incorporating those colours, dear to every one of us, which had once 
gained so much honour for the German nation it bore testimony to our 
reverence for the past and was at the same time symbolic of the Movement’s 
aims. 


Our nationalist and socialist programme was made manifest in our flag. 
The red expressed the social thought underlying the Movement, white the 
national thought, and the swastika signified the mission allotted to us—the 
struggle for the victory of Aryan mankind and at the same time the triumph of 
the ideal of creative work which in itself is, and always will be, anti-Semitic. 


Two years later, when our squad of hall-guards had long since grown 
into storm detachments, it seemed necessary to give this defensive organisation 
of a young Weltanschauung a particular symbol of victory, namely, a standard. 


I also designed this and entrusted, the execution of it to an old party 
comrade, Herr Gahr, who was a goldsmith. Ever since that time this standard 
has been the distinctive emblem of the National Socialist struggle. 


The increasing interest taken in our meetings, particularly during 1920, 
compelled us at times to hold two meetings a week. 


Crowds gathered round our posters, the large meeting-halls in the town 
were always filled and tens of thousands of people, who had been led astray 
by the teachings of Marxism, found their way back to the national community to 
assist in the work of fighting for the liberation of the Reich. 


The public in Munich had got to know us. We were being talked about. 
The term ‘National Socialist’ had become common property to many and 
signified for them a definite party programme. 


Our circle of supporters and even of members was constantly increasing, 
so that in the winter of 1920—21 we were able to appear as a strong party in 
Munich. 


At that time there was no party in Munich, with the exception of the 
Marxist parties, and certainly no nationalist party which was able to hold such 


561 


mass demonstrations as ours. The Miinchner-Kindl-Keller, which held five 
thousand people, was more than once overcrowded and up till then there was 
only one other hall, the Circus Krone, which we had not yet ventured to hire. 


At the end of January 1921 there was again great cause for anxiety in 
Germany. The Paris Agreement, by which Germany pledged herself to pay the 
crazy sum of a hundred milliard gold marks, was to be confirmed by the 
London Treaty. 


Thereupon an well-established Munich co-operative association, 
representative of so-called volkisch groups, deemed it advisable to call a 
public meeting of protest. 


I became nervous and restless when | saw that a lot of time was being 
wasted and nothing achieved. At first a meeting was suggested in the 
Konigsplatz; on second thoughts this proposal was turned down, as someone 
feared the proceedings might be wrecked by Red elements. 


Another suggestion was a demonstration in front of the Feldherrnhalle, 
but this also came to nothing. Finally, a combined meeting in the Miinchner- 
Kindl-Keller was suggested. Meanwhile day after day went by; the parties 
entirely ignored the terrible event and the cooperative association could not 
decide on a definite date for holding the demonstration. 


On Tuesday, February Ist, I put forward an urgent demand for a final 
decision. I was told I should be given it on Wednesday. On that day I demanded 
to be told clearly, if and when, the meeting was to take place. 


The reply was again uncertain and evasive, it being stated that it was 
‘intended’ to arrange a demonstration for that day week. At that I lost all 
patience and decided to conduct a meeting of protest on my own. 


At noon on Wednesday I dictated in ten minutes the text of the poster and 
at the same time hired the Circus Krone for the next day, February 3rd. 


In those days this was a tremendous venture, not only because of the 
uncertainty of filling that vast hall, but also because of the risk of the meeting 
being broken up. 


Numerically, our squad of hall-guards was not strong enough for this vast 
hall. I was also uncertain about what to do in case the meeting was broken up, 
as I imagined it would be more difficult to deal with that contingency, in the 


562 


huge circus building than in an ordinary meeting hall. 


But events showed that my fears were misplaced, the opposite being the 
case. In that vast building a band of men bent on breaking up the meeting could 
be tackled and subdued more easily than in crowded halls. 


One thing was certain—a failure would throw us back for a long time to 
come. If one meeting were broken up our prestige would be seriously injured 
and our opponents would be encouraged to repeat their success. 


That would lead to sabotage of our work in connection with further 
meetings and months of difficult struggle would be necessary to overcome this. 


We had only one day in which to post our bills, Thursday. 


Unfortunately it rained during the morning of that day and there was 
reason to fear that many people would prefer to remain at home rather than 
hurry to a meeting through rain and snow, especially when there was likely to 
be violence and bloodshed. 


Indeed on that Thursday morning I was suddenly struck by the fear that 
the hall might never be filled to capacity, which would have made me 
ridiculous in the eyes of the co-operative association. 


I therefore immediately dictated various leaflets and had them printed 
and distributed in the afternoon. Of course, they contained an invitation to 
attend the meeting. 


Two lorries which I hired were draped as much as possible in red, each 
had our new flag hoisted on it and was then ‘manned’ by fifteen or twenty 
members of our Party. 


Orders were given to the members to canvas the streets thoroughly, 
distribute leaflets and conduct propaganda for the mass meeting to be held that 
evening. It was the first time that lorries had driven through the streets bearing 
flags and not manned by Marxists. The public stared open-mouthed at these 
red-draped cars, and in the outlying districts clenched fists were angrily raised 
at this new evidence of ‘provocation of the proletariat.’ 


Were not the Marxists the only ones entitled to hold meetings and drive 
about in motor-lorries? 


By seven o’clock in the evening the circus hall was by no means full. I 


563 


was being kept informed by telephone every ten minutes and was becoming 
uneasy. 


Usually at seven or a quarter past our meeting-halls were already half- 
filled and sometimes even packed, but I soon discovered the cause of this. 


I had entirely forgotten to take into account the huge dimensions of this 
new meeting-place. A thousand people in the Hofbrauhaus was quite an 
impressive sight, but the same number in the Circus building was swallowed 
up in its vastness and was hardly noticeable. 


Shortly afterwards I received more hopeful reports and at a quarter to 
eight I was informed that the hall was three-quarters full, with huge crowds 
still lined up at the pay-boxes. I then left for the meeting. 


I arrived at the Circus building at two minutes past eight. There was still 
a crowd outside, composed partly of inquisitive people and among them many 
opponents who preferred to wait outside for developments. 


When I entered the great hall I felt the same joy I had felt a year 
previously at the first meeting in the Festsaal of the Miinchener Hofbrauhaus; 
but it was not until I had forced my way through the solid wall of people and 
reached the platform that I perceived the full measure of our success. 


The hall was before me, like a huge shell packed with thousands upon 
thousands of people. Even the arena was densely crowded. More than five 
thousand six hundred tickets had been sold and, allowing for the unemployed, 
poor students and our own detachments of men for keeping order, a crowd of 
about six thousand five hundred must have been present. 


My theme was, ‘Future or Downfall’ and I was filled with joy at the 
conviction that the future was represented by the crowd that I was addressing. 


I began, and spoke for about two and a half hours. I had the feeling after 
the first half-hour that the meeting was going to be a big success. Contact had at 
once been established with all those thousands of individuals. 


After the first hour the speech was already being received by 
spontaneous outbursts of applause, but after the second hour this died down to 
a solemn stillness which I was to experience so often later on in this same hall 
and which will be for-ever remembered by all those present. 


564 


Nothing broke, this impressive silence and only when the last word had 
been spoken did the meeting give vent to its feelings by singing the national 
anthem. I watched the scene during the next twenty minutes, as the vast hall 
slowly emptied itself, and only then did I leave the platform, a happy man, and 
make my way home. 


Photographs were taken of this first meeting in the Circus Krone in 
Munich. They are more eloquent than words in demonstrating the success of 
this meeting. The bourgeois papers reproduced photographs and reported the 
meeting as having been merely ‘nationalist’ in character-in their usual modest 
fashion they omitted all mention of its promoters. 


Thus we had, for the first time, far exceeded the limits of an ordinary 
party. We could now no longer be ignored, and to dispel all doubt that the 
meeting was merely an isolated success, I immediately arranged for another at 
the Circus Krone in the following week, with the same results. 


Once more the vast hall was filled to overflowing; so much so that I 
decided to hold a third meeting in the same hall during the following week, and 
yet a third time the immense building was filled with people. 


After these initial successes early in 1921 I increased our activity in 
Munich still further. I not only held meetings once a week, but often twice a 
week and very often during, the summer and autumn as many as three meetings 
were held every week. 


We met regularly at the Circus Hall and it gave us great satisfaction to 
see that every meeting brought us the same measure of success. 


The result was shown 1n an ever-growing number of supporters and an 
increase in the number of party members. 


Naturally the news of our success did not allow our opponents to sleep 
soundly. At first their tactics fluctuated between the use of terrorist tactics and 
silence. But as they were forced to realise that neither terrorism nor silence 
could hinder the progress of our Movement, they had recourse to a supreme act 
of terrorism which was intended to put a definite end to our activities as 
regards the holding of meetings. 


As a pretext for action along this line they took advantage of a 
mysterious attack on one of the Landtag deputies, named Erhard Auer. It was 
declared that someone had fired several shots at this man one evening, that is 


565 


to say, he was not actually hit, but an attempt had been made to shoot him. 


Fabulous presence of mind and heroic courage on the part of the Social 
Democratic leader not only foiled this dastardly attempt on his life, but also 
put the crazy would-be assassins to flight. 


They were so quick and fled so far that subsequently the police could not 
find even the slightest traces of them. This mysterious episode was used by the 
organ of the Social Democratic Party to arouse public feeling against the 
Movement and at the same time it delivered its old rigmarole about what was 
to happen in the near future. They would see to it that the proletariat would 
intervene in time and prevent us from flourishing like the green bay-tree. A 
few days later the real attack came. It was decided finally to interrupt one of 
our meetings which was billed to, take place in the Miinchener Hofbrauhaus 
and at which I myself was to speak. 


On November 4th, 1921, between six and seven o’clock in the evening, I 
received the first definite news that the meeting would positively be broken up 
and that to carry out this action our adversaries had decided to send to the 
meeting large numbers of workmen employed in certain ‘Red’ factories. 


It was due to an unfortunate accident that we did not receive this news 
sooner. On that day, we had given up our old business office in the Sternecker 
Gasse in Munich and moved into other premises; or rather we had given-up the 
old offices and our new quarters were not yet in functioning order. 


The telephone had already been cut off in the old office and had not yet 
been installed in the new one. Hence it happened that several attempts to 
inform us by telephone of the break-up which had been planned for that 
evening failed. 


Consequently our hall-guards were not present in strength at that meeting. 
There was only one squad present, which did not consist of the usual one 
hundred men, but only of about forty-six, and our machinery for giving the 
alarm was not yet sufficiently perfect for us to be able to collect within the 
space of an hour a sufficient number of guards to deal with the situation. 


It must also be added that on several previous occasions we had been 
forewarned, but nothing unusual had happened. The old saying that revolutions 
which are predicted seldom take place had hitherto proved true in our case. 


Possibly this was an additional reason why sufficient precautions had 


566 


not been taken on that day to cope with the brutal determination of our 
opponents to break up our meeting. 


Finally, we did not believe that the Hofbrauhaus in Munich was suitable 
for the interruptive tactics of our adversaries. We had feared such a thing far 
more in the bigger halls, especially in the Circus Krone, but on this point we 
were to learn a very serviceable lesson on that evening. 


Later, we studied this whole question scientifically and arrived at 
conclusions, both interesting and incredible, which were afterwards of 
fundamental importance in determining the organisation and tactics of our 
Storm Troops. 


When I arrived at the entrance hall of the Hofbrauhaus at 7:45 p.m. that 
evening, I realised that there could be no doubt as to what the Reds intended. 


The hall was filled, and for that reason the police had barred the 
entrances. Our adversaries, who had arrived very early, were in the hall, and 
our followers were, for the most part, outside. 


The small bodyguard of S.A. men awaited me at the entrance. I had the 
doors leading to the principal hall closed and then asked the bodyguard of 
forty-five or forty-six men to come forward. 


I made it clear to them that perhaps on that evening they would for the 
first time have to show their unbending and unbreakable loyalty to the 
Movement and that not one of us must leave the hall unless he were carried out 
dead. 


I added that I would remain in the hall and that I did not believe that one 
of them would abandon me, and that if I saw any one of them act the coward I 
myself would personally tear off his armlet and his badge. 


I demanded of them that they should come forward if the slightest attempt 
were made to sabotage the meeting and that they must remember that the best 
defence is always attack. 


I was answered with a triple ‘Heil’ which sounded more hoarse and 
enthusiastic than usual. 


Then I advanced through the hall and could take in the situation with my 
own eyes. Our opponents sat close together and tried to pierce me with their 


567 


looks. Innumerable pairs of eyes glowing with hatred and rage were fixed on 
me, while others with sneering faces greeted me with shouts and threats to the 
effect that they would ‘settle our hash’, that we should ‘look out for ourselves’ 
and that they would ‘stop our mouths once and for all’, along with other 
expressions of an equally elegant character. 


They knew that they were superior in numbers and they acted 
accordingly. Yet we were able to open the meeting, and I began to speak. In the 
hall of the Hofbrauhaus I always stood against one of the side walls and my 
platform was a beer table. Therefore I was always right in the midst of the 
audience. 


Perhaps this circumstance was responsible for creating a certain 
atmosphere which I never sensed elsewhere. 


Before me, and especially towards my left, there were only opponents, 
seated or standing. They were mostly robust youths and men from the Maffei 
Factory, from Kustermann’s, from the Isaria meter works, etc. 


Along the left-hand wall of the hall they had pushed their way close to 
my table and now began to collect beer-mugs, that is to say, they ordered one 
beer after another and placed the empty mugs under the tables. 


In this way they succeeded in collecting whole batteries of ammunition, 
and no one would have been more surprised than I, had the meeting passed off 
quietly. 


In spite of all the interruptions, I was able to speak for about an hour and 
a half and I began to feel that I was master of the situation. 


Even the ringleaders among the disturbers appeared to be convinced of 
this, for they steadily became more uneasy, often left the hall, returned and 
spoke to their men in an obviously nervous way. 


A small psychological error which I committed in replying to an 
interruption, a mistake of which I myself was conscious the moment the words 
had left my mouth, gave the sign for the outbreak. 


There were a few furiously angry shouts and all in a moment a man 
jumped on a seat and shouted ‘Liberty!’ 


At that signal the champions of liberty began their work. 


568 


In a few moments the hall was filled with a yelling shrieking mob. 
Numerous beer-mugs flew like shells above their heads. Amid this din, one 
heard the crash of chair legs, the crashing of mugs, shouts, yells and screams. 


It was a mad uproar and I should just like to have seen such a scene 
enacted at a bourgeois meeting. I stood were I was and could observe my men 
doing their duty, every one of them. 


The fun had hardly begun when my Storm Troops, as they were called 
from that day onwards, launched their attack. Like wolves they threw 
themselves on the enemy again and again, in parties of eight or ten and began 
steadily to drive them out of the hall. 


After five minutes I could see hardly one of them that was not streaming 
with blood. Then I realised what kind of men many of them were, above all my 
brave Maurice and Hess, who is my private secretary to-day, and many others 
who, even though seriously wounded, returned to the attack again and again, as 
long as they could stand on their feet. 


Pandemonium reigned for some twenty minutes and by that time our 
opponents, who had numbered seven or eight hundred, had been driven from 
the hall or hurled out headlong by my men, who had not numbered fifty. 


Only, in the left corner a big crowd was still standing out against our 
men and putting up a stiff fight. Then two pistol-shots rang out from the 
entrance to the hall and immediately wild shooting broke out on all sides. 
One’s heart almost rejoiced at this spectacle which recalled memories of the 
War. 


At that moment it was not possible to identify the persons who had fired 
the shots, but at any rate I could see that my men had returned to the attack with 
increased fury, until finally the last disturbers were overcome and flung out of 
the hall. 


About twenty-five minutes had passed since it all began. The hall looked 
as 1f a bomb had exploded there. 


Many of my comrades were being bandaged and others were being taken 
away, but we remained masters of the situation. Hermann Esser, who was 
chairman of the meeting, announced, ‘The meeting will continue. The speaker 
will proceed.’ So I went on with my speech. 


569 


When we ourselves had declared the meeting at an end, an excited police 
officer rushed in, waved his arms and declared, ‘The meeting is dissolved.’ 


I could not help laughing at this example of the law’s delay. It was 
typical of the officiousness of the police. The more insignificant they are, the 
more important they try to appear. 


That evening taught us many a lesson and our adversaries never forgot 
the lesson they had received. 


Up to the autumn of 1923 the Minchener Post did not again threaten us 
with the clenched fist of the proletariat.

CHAPTER VIII: THE STRONG ARE STRONGER 
WITHOUT ALLIES 


In the preceding chapter I mentioned the existence of a co-operative 
association between the German patriotic societies. Here I shall deal briefly 
with this question. 


In speaking of a co-operative association we generally mean a group of 
societies which, for the purpose of facilitating their work, establish mutual 
relations for collaborating along certain lines, appointing a common board of 
management vested with a varying degree of authority with a view to 
undertaking concerted action. 


This very fact shows that these were societies, associations and parties, 
whose aims and course of action were not too widely divergent, and it was 
asserted that this was invariably true. 


The average citizen is pleased and reassured when he hears that these 
societies, by establishing a co-operative association, have at long last 
discovered a common platform on which they can stand united and have 
eliminated all causes of dissension. 


Therewith a general conviction arises, to the effect that such a union is 
an immense gain in strength and that small groups which were weak as long as 
they stood alone have now suddenly become strong. 


Yet this conviction is generally a mistaken one. 


It will be interesting and, in my opinion, important for the better 
understanding of this question to try to get a clear notion of how it came about 
that so many of these associations, unions, etc., were formed when all of them 
declared that they had the same ends in view. 


In itself it would be logical to expect that one aim should be fought for 
by a single association and it would be more sensible if there were not a 
number of associations fighting for the same aim. 


In the beginning there was undoubtedly only one association which had 
this one fixed aim in view. Some men somewhere stated a definite fact, called 
for the solution of a definite problem, enunciated their aim and founded a 


573 


movement for the purpose of achieving that aim. 


That is how an association or a party is founded, whose programme may 
be either the abolition of existing evils or the positive establishment of a 
certain order of things in the future. 


Once such a movement has come into existence it may lay practical 
claim to certain priority rights. 


The natural course of things would now be that all those who wish to 
fight for the same objective as this movement is striving for, should identify 
themselves with it and thus increase its strength, so that the common purpose in 
view may be the better served. 


Especially men of superior intelligence must feel, one and all, that by 
joining the movement they are establishing precisely those conditions which 
are necessary for practical success in the common struggle. 


Accordingly it is reasonable and, in a certain sense, honest—which 
honesty, as I shall show later, 1s an element of very great importance—that only 
one movement should be founded for the purpose of attaining one aim. 


The fact that this does not happen must be attributed to two causes. The 
first may almost be described as tragic; the second as despicable, because it 
has its source in the weaknesses of human nature. 


But, when all is said and done, I see in both causes only facts which go 
to strengthen our determination and our energy and which, by this 
intensification of human activity render possible the solution of the problem in 
question. 


The tragic reason why it so often happens that the pursuit of one definite 
task is not left to one association alone is as follows: Generally speaking, 
every action carried out on a grand scale is the expression of a desire that has 
already existed for a long time in millions of human hearts, a longing which 
may have been nourished, in silence. 


It may even happen that throughout the centuries many men have been 
yearning for the solution of a definite problem, because they have been 
suffering under an unendurable state of affairs, without hope of fulfilment of the 
universal longing. 


574 


Nations which are no longer capable of finding a heroic deliverance 
from such a sorrowful fate may be looked upon as effete. 


But, on the other hand, nothing affords better proof of the vital forces of a 
people and the consequent guarantee of its right to exist than that one day, 
through a happy decree of Destiny, a man arises who is capable of liberating 
his people from some great oppression, or of wiping out some bitter distress, 
or of calming the national soul which had been tormented through is sense of 
insecurity, and thus fulfilling what had long been the universal yearning of the 
people. 


An essential characteristic of what are called the great questions of the 
age 1s that thousands undertake the task of solving them and that many feel 
themselves called upon to fulfil this task; it may even be that Destiny herself 
puts forward many for selection, in order that, through the free play of events 
the strongest and most capable man shall ultimately be the victor and be 
entrusted with the task of solving the problem. Thus it may happen that for 
centuries many are discontent with the form in which their religious life 
expresses itself and yearn for a reformation. 


So it may come about that through this impulse of the soul some dozens 
of men may arise who believe that, by virtue of their understanding and their 
knowledge, they are called upon to solve the religious difficulties of the day 
and accordingly present themselves as the prophets of a new doctrine or at 
least as declared adversaries of the accepted dogmas. 


Here also it is certain that the laws of Nature will take their course, 
inasmuch as the strongest will be destined to fulfil the great mission, but 
usually the others are slow to acknowledge that only one man is called upon to 
fulfil the task. 


On the contrary they all believe that they have an equal right to engage in 
the solution of the difficulties 1n question and that they are equally fitted for 
that task. 


Their contemporary world is generally quite unable to decide which of 
them possesses the highest gifts and accordingly merits universal support. 


Thus, in the course of centuries, and indeed often within the same epoch, 
different men establish different movements to achieve the same end. 


At least the end is declared by the founders of the movements to be the 


my) 


same, or may be looked upon as such by the bulk of the people. 


The people nourish vague desires and have only general opinions, 
without having any precise notion of their own ideals and desires or of the 
question whether and how it is possible for these ideals and desires to be 
fulfilled. 


The tragedy lies in the fact that many men struggle to reach the same 
objective by different roads, each one genuinely believing in his own mission 
and holding himself in duty bound to follow his own road without regard for 
the others. 


These movements, parties, religious groups, etc., originate entirely 
independently of one another out of the general urge of the age, and all witha 
view to working towards the same goal. 


It may seem a tragic thing, at least at first sight, that this should be so, 
because people are too often inclined to think that forces which are dispersed 
in different directions would attain their ends far more quickly and more surely 
if they were united in one common effort. 


This is, however, not so, for Nature herself decides according to the 
rules of her inexorable logic. She leaves these diverse groups to compete with 
one another and dispute the palm of victory in order, finally, to lead that 
movement to the final goal which has chosen the clearest, shortest and surest 
path. 


How can the world decide which path is right or wrong, if the available 
forces are note given free play, if the final decision is not taken out of the hands 
of men who are convinced of their own infallibility and left to the infallible 
test of established success which 1s always the final confirmation of the justice 
of a course of action. 


Therefore, if various groups are striving by various routes to reach the 
same goal, they will, inasmuch as they are aware that similar efforts are being 
made elsewhere, examine more critically their own method of procedure, 
simplify it if possible and, by exerting themselves to the utmost, try to reach 
that goal more quickly. 


Through this rivalry the faculties of each individual protagonist are 
developed to a still higher pitch of perfection and the human race has 
frequently owed its progress to the lessons learned front former attempts which 


576 


have come to grief. 


Thus it happens that in the initial dispersion of effort for which the 
individual is not consciously to blame and which appeared at first sight to be 
fraught with tragic consequences, we may recognise the means by which the 
best method is finally selected. 


History shows that, as most people believe, the two parties by whicha 
solution of the German problem might have been reached amid whose chief 
advocates were Austria and Prussia, the Habsburg and the Hohenzollern, 
should have been united from the outset. 


In the opinion of these same people both parties should have decided to 
follow either one path or the other, but at that time, the path chosen would 
inevitably have been that of the rival who was then more important and 
Austria’s aims would never have included the foundation of the German Reich. 


A strong and united German Reich finally arose out of that which many 
millions of Germans deplored in their hearts as the last and most terrible 
manifestation of our fratricidal strife. 


The truth is that the German Imperial Crown was secured on the 
battlefield of Koniggratz and not, as was commonly asserted afterwards, in the 
battles that were waged outside Paris. 


Thus the foundation of the German Reich was not the consequence of any 
common will working along common lines, but it was rather the outcome of a 
deliberate, if sometimes unconscious, struggle for hegemony, in which Prussia 
finally was victorious. 


Anybody who is not so blinded by party politics as to be unable to 
recognise the truth must perforce admit that the so-called wisdom of men 
would never have come to the same wise decision which the wisdom of Life 
itself, that is to say, the free play of forces, finally brought to realisation. 


For in the German territories of two hundred years ago who would 
seriously have believed that Hohenzollern Prussia, and not Habsburg, would 
become the nucleus, the founder and the tutor of the new Reich? 


And, on the other hand, who would deny to-day that Destiny thus acted 
with more insight than human wisdom. Who could now imagine a German 
Reich based on the foundations of an effete and degenerate dynasty? 


ay | 


The natural course of events, even though it took centuries of struggle, 
finally awarded the superior force the position which it was fitted to occupy. 


This will always be so and will remain, as it always has been, an 
immutable law. It is, therefore, not a matter for regret if different men set out to 
attain the same objective by various means. 


In this way the strongest and swiftest is recognised and will be the 
victor. 


There is yet a second cause for the fact that often in the lives of nations 
several movements which show the same characteristics strive by different 
routes to reach what appears to be the same goal. 


This second cause is not at all tragic, but merely deserves scorn. 


It arises from a sad mixture of envy, jealousy, ambition and predatory 
instincts. Unfortunately these failings are often found united in single 
specimens of the human species. 


The moment a man arises who profoundly understands the distress of his 
people and, having diagnosed the evil with perfect accuracy, takes measures to 
cure it; the moment he fixes his aim and chooses the means to reach it then 
paltry and pettifogging people become all attention and eagerly follow the 
doings of this man who has thus come before the public eye. 


Just like sparrows who are apparently indifferent, but in reality keenly 
observant of the movements of their more fortunate companion with the morsel 
of bread, in order that they may snatch it from him if he should momentarily 
relax his hold, so it is also with the human species. 


All that is needed is that one man should strike out on a new road and 
then a crowd of poltroons will prick up their ears and begin to hope that some 
trifling gain may lie at the end of that road. 


The moment they think they have discovered where the reward is to be 
reaped they hasten to find another route by which to reach the goal more 
quickly. 


AS soon as a new movement is founded and has formulated a definite 
programme, people of that kind come forward and proclaim that they are 
fighting for the same cause. 


578 


This does not imply that they are honestly ready to join the ranks of such 
a movement and thus recognise its right of priority. 


It implies rather that they intend to steal the programme and found a new 
party. In doing this they are shameless enough to assure the unthinking public 
that they had long intended to take the same line of action as the other had now 
taken and frequently succeed in thus placing themselves in a favourable light, 
instead of arousing the general disapprobation which they justly deserve. 


For it is a piece of gross impudence to steal another’s slogan and 
proclaim it as one’s own, to steal the programme of another, and then to form a 
separate group as if all this had been created by the new founder of this group. 


The impudence of such conduct is particularly obvious when the 
individuals who first caused dispersion and disruption by their new foundation 
are, the same who (as experience has shown) are most emphatic in proclaiming 
the necessity for union and unity the moment they find they cannot catch up with 
their adversary’s advance. 


It is to that kind of conduct that so-called ‘volkisch disintegration’ is to 
be attributed. 


Certainly in the years 1918-1919 the founding of a multitude of new 
groups, parties, etc., calling themselves ‘volkisch’ was a natural phenomenon 
of the time, for which the founders were not responsible. 


By 1920 the National Socialist German Labour Party had slowly 
crystallised from all these parties and had become supreme. 


There could be no better proof of the sterling honesty of certain 
individual founders than the fact that many of them decided, in a way that calls 
for admiration, to sacrifice their manifestly less successful movements to the 
stronger movement, by joining it unconditionally and dissolving their own. 


This is especially true in regard to Julius Streicher, who was at that time 
the protagonist of the German Socialist Party in Nurnberg. 


The National Socialist German Labour Party had been founded with 
similar aims in view, but quite independently of the other. 


As I have already said, Streicher, then a teacher in Nurnberg, was the 
chief protagonist of the German Socialist Party. He had a sacred conviction of 


519 


the mission and future of his own movement. 


As soon, however, as he recognised the superior strength and steadier 
growth of the National Socialist Party, he gave up his work in the German 
Socialist Party and called upon his followers to fall into line with the National 
Socialist German Labour Party, which had emerged victorious from the mutual 
contest, and carry on the fight for the common cause within its ranks. The 
decision was personally a difficult one for him, but it showed a profound sense 
of honour. 


When that first period of the Movement was over, there remained no 
further dispersion of forces, for their honest intentions had led the men of that 
day to the same honourable, straightforward and just conclusion. 


What we now call the ‘volkisch disintegration’ owes its existence 
exclusively to the second of the two causes which I have mentioned. 


Ambitious men who, at first, had no ideas of their own, and still less any 
‘conception of aims to be pursued, felt themselves ‘called upon’ exactly at that 
moment in which the success of the National Socialist German Labour Party 
became unquestionable. 


Programmes suddenly appeared which were mere transcripts of ours. 
Ideas were proclaimed which had been filched from us. Aims were enunciated 
on behalf of which we had been fighting for several years, and a course of 
action chosen which the National Socialists had for a long time followed. 


All kinds of means were resorted to for the purpose of trying to convince 
the public that, although the National Socialist German Labour Party had now 
been in existence for a long time it was found necessary to establish these new 
parties, but the more noble the motives put forward, the more insincere the 
phraseology. 


In reality there was only one dominant motive, namely, the personal 
ambition of the founders, who wished to play a part in which their own pigmy 
talents could contribute nothing except the grass effrontery of appropriating the 
ideas of others, a mode of conduct which in ordinary life is looked upon as 
thieving. 


At that time there was not an idea or concept launched by other people 
which these political kleptomaniacs did not seize upon at once for the purpose 
of applying it for their own ends. 


580 


Those who did all this were the same people who subsequently, with 
tears in their eyes, profoundly deplored ‘vdlkisch disintegration’ and spoke 
unceasingly about the ‘necessity for unity.’ 


In doing this they nurtured the secret hope that they might be able to cry 
down the others, who would tire of hearing these loud-mouthed accusations 
and would end up by abandoning in favour of the thieves, not only the ideas 
already stolen by the latter, but the movements which had been founded for the 
execution of these ideas. 


When that did not occur and the new enterprises, thanks to the poor 
mentality of their promoters, did not show, the favourable results which had 
been promised beforehand, then they became more modest in their pretensions 
and were happy if they could find refuge in one of the so-called ‘co-operative 
associations.’ 


At that period everything which could not stand on its own feet joined 
one of those cooperative associations, probably in the belief that eight cripples 
arm-in-arm equalled one gladiator. 


If among all these cripples there was one who was sound of limb he had 
to use all his strength to sustain the others and thus he himself was, in the long 
run, crippled. 


We ought to look upon the question of joining these co-operative 
associations as a tactical problem, but, in coming to a decision, we must never 
forget the fundamental principle that through the formation of a co-operative 
association, societies which are weak in themselves can never be made strong, 
whereas it can and does not infrequently happen that a strong society or party 
loses in strength by joining a coalition of weaker ones. 


It is a mistake to believe that a factor of strength will result from the 
coalition of weak groups, because experience shows that in any form and under 
any conditions the majority is representative of the stupid and cowardly 
elements. 


Hence, a multiplicity of societies or parties is, aS soon as it comes under 
the control of a board of management consisting of several persons elected by 
the parties, the victim of weakness and cowardice. 


Through such a coalition the free play of forces is paralysed, the struggle 
for the-selection of the best is abolished and therewith the necessary and final 


581 


victory of the healthier and stronger elements is impeded. 


Coalitions of that kind are inimical to the process of natural 
development, because for the most part they hinder rather than advance the 
solution of the problem which is the object of the struggle. 


It may happen that, from considerations of a purely tactical kind, the 
leaders of a movement which looks ahead will enter into a coalition with 
other, movements for the treatment of special questions and may also act in 
common with them, but this can be only for a short and limited period. 


Such a coalition must not be permanent, if the movement does not wish to 
renounce its liberating mission, because if it should become indissolubly tied 
up in such a combination it would lose the capacity and the right to allow its 
own forces to work freely in following out a natural development, in order to 
overcome rivals and attain its own objective. 


It must never be forgotten that nothing really great in this world has ever 
been achieved through coalitions, but that such achievements have always been 
due to the triumph of the individual. 


Successes achieved through coalitions, owing to the very nature of their 
source carry in them from the very start the germs of future disintegration and 
the possibility of losing what has already been achieved. 


The great revolutions which have taken place in human thought and have 
transformed the aspect of the world would have been inconceivable and 
impossible except as the titanic struggles waged by individual elements. They 
could never have been the work of coalitions. 


Above all things, the volkisch State will never be created by the 
compromising attitude of co-operative associations but only by the iron 
determination of a single movement which has struggled and triumphed over 
all the others.

584 


CHAPTER Ix: NATURE AND ORGANISATION OF 
THE STORM TROOPS 


The strength of the old state rested on three pillars: the monarchical form 
of government, the civil service, and the Army. 


The Revolution of 1918 abolished the form of government, disbanded the 
Army and abandoned the civil service to the corruption of party politics. 


Thus the essential supports of the so-called authority of the State were 
shattered. This authority nearly always depends on three elements, which are 
the essential foundations of all authority. 


Popular support is the first element which is necessary for the creation of 
authority, but an authority resting on that foundation alone 1s still quite frail, 
uncertain and vacillating. 


Hence, everyone who finds himself vested with an authority that is based 
only on popular support must take measures to improve and consolidate the 
foundations of that authority by the acquisition of power. 


Accordingly, we must look upon power, that is to say the capacity to use 
force, as the second foundation on which all authority is based. This foundation 
is more stable and secure, but not always stronger, than the first. 


If popular support and power are united and can endure for a certain 
time, then an authority may evolve which is based on a still stronger 
foundation, namely, the authority of tradition. 


Finally, if popular support, power, and tradition are united together, then 
the authority based on them may be looked upon as invincible. 


In Germany the Revolution abolished this last foundation. There was no 
longer even a traditional authority. With the collapse of the old Reich, the 
abolition of the monarchical form of government, the destruction of all the old 
insignia of greatness and the imperial symbols, tradition was shattered at a 
blow. 


The result was that the authority of the State was shaken to its 
foundations. 


585 


The second pillar of state authority, namely power, also ceased to exist. 
In order to carry through the Revolution it was necessary to disband that body 
which had hitherto incorporated the organised force and power of the State, 
namely, the Army. Indeed some decimated fragments of the Army itself had to 
be employed as fighting elements in the Revolution. 


The armies at the front were not subjected in the same measure to this 
process of disruption, but as they gradually left farther behind them the fields 
of glory on which they had fought heroically for four and a half years they were 
attacked by the corrosive acid that was destroying the discipline of the home 
front. When they arrived at the demobilizing centres, they fell into that state of 
confusion which was styled ‘voluntary obedience,’ at the time of the Soldiers’ 
Councils. 


Of course it was out of the question to think of founding any kind of 
authority on this crowd of mutineering soldiers, who looked upon military 
service as a job of eight hours per day. 


Therefore, the second element, that which guarantees the stability of 
authority, was also abolished and the Revolution had only the original element, 
popular support, on which to build up its authority, but this basis was 
extraordinarily insecure. 


With one mighty blow, the Revolution had shattered the old state edifice, 
but only because the normal equilibrium within the social structure of the 
nation had already been destroyed by the war. 


Every national body is made up of three main classes. At one extreme 
we have the best of the people, taking the word ‘best’ as indicating those who 
are highly endowed with the civic virtues and are noted for their courage and 
their readiness to sacrifice their private interests. 


At the other extreme are the worst dregs of humanity, in whom vice and 
egotistic interests prevail. Between these two extremes stands the third class, 
which is made up of the broad middle stratum, which does not incorporate 
either radiant heroism or vulgar vice. 


Those eras which mark the rise of a State are characterized and indeed 
made possible only by the fact that they occur under the exclusive leadership of 
that section belonging to the best extreme of the population. 


Times of normal and steady development, or of stable conditions, owe 


586 


their existence and outwardly visible characteristics to the preponderating 
influence of the middle stratum. 


In this stage the two extreme classes counterbalance each other, or in 
other words; they cancel each other. Times of national collapse are determined 
by the preponderating influence of the worst elements. 


It must be noted here, however, that the broad masses, which constitute 
what I have called the middle section, come forward and make their influence 
felt only when the two extreme sections are engaged in mutual strife, in case 
one of the extreme sections comes out victorious, the middle section will 
readily submit to its domination. 


If the best dominate, the broad masses will follow it. Should the worst 
extreme prove triumphant, then the middle section will at least offer no 
opposition to it, for the masses that constitute the middle stratum never fight 
their own battles. The bloodshed which continued for four and a half years 
during the War destroyed the inner equilibrium between these three sections in 
so far as it can be said (with all due respect for the sacrifices made by the 
middle section) that it nearly led to the best extreme being bled white, because 
the total amount of irreplaceable and heroic German lives lost during these 
four and a half years was really tremendous. 


Just think of the hundreds of thousands of instances when there was a call 
for volunteers for the front, volunteers for patrol duty, volunteer dispatch 
carriers, volunteers to go out and rig up a telephone, volunteers for bridge 
building, volunteers for the submarines, volunteers for the air service, 
volunteers for the storm battalions, and so on. 


During four and a half years, and on thousands of occasions, there was 
always the cry for volunteers and again for volunteers, and the result was 
always the same. 


Beardless young fellows or fully developed men, all filled with an 
ardent love for their country; urged on by their own courageous spirit or by a 
lofty sense of their duty—it was always such men who answered the call for 
volunteers. 


There were tens of thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of such 
cases, so that that kind of human material steadily grew scarcer and scarcer. 


Those who were not killed were either maimed on the field of battle or 


587 


disappeared gradually owing to the steady decrease in the number of 
SUrVIVOTS. 


Let us remember, above all, that in 1914 whole armies were composed 
of volunteers who, owing to a criminal lack of conscience on the part of our 
feckless parliamentarians, had not received a regulation peace-time training 
and were consequently defenceless cannon-fodder at the mercy of the enemy. 


The four hundred thousand who fell or were permanently maimed on the 
battlefields of Flanders were irreplaceable. Their loss was something far more 
than a numerical loss. 


With their death the scales, being too lightly weighted at the best end, 
tipped rapidly upwards and the vulgar, infamous and cowardly elements, in 
short, those who constituted the worst extreme of our population, weighed 
heavier in the balance than previously. 


In addition to this, for four and a half years, our best human material was 
being thinned to an exceptional degree on the battlefields, while the worst 
extreme surpassed itself in the art of self-preservation. 


For each heroic volunteer who made the supreme sacrifice and ascended 
the steps of Valhalla, there was a shirker who cunningly dodged death on the 
plea of being engaged in business that was of more or less national importance 
at home. 


Thus, the state of affairs at the end of the war was as follows: The great 
middle stratum of the nation had fulfilled its duty and paid its toll of blood. 


One extreme of the population, which was constituted of the best 
elements, had, with exemplary heroism, sacrificed itself almost to a man. 


The other extreme, which was, constituted of the worst elements of the 
population, had preserved itself almost intact, through taking advantage of 
absurd laws and also because the authorities failed to enforce certain articles 
of the military code. 


This carefully preserved scum of our nation then engineered the 
Revolution, and the reason why it could do so was that the extreme section 
composed of the best elements was no longer there to oppose it. It no longer 
existed. 


588 


Hence the German Revolution, from the very beginning, depended on 
only one section of the population. This act of Cain was not committed by the 
German people as such, but by an obscure rabble of deserters, hooligans, etc. 
The man at the front gladly welcomed the end of the strife in which so much 
blood had been shed. He was happy to be able to return home and be with his 
wife and children once again, but he had no moral connection with the 
Revolution. He did not like it, nor did he like those who had provoked and 
organised it. 


During the four and a half years of that utter struggle at the front he had 
come to forget the party hyenas at home and all their wrangling had become 
alien to him. 


The Revolution was really popular only with a small section of the 
German people, namely, that Class and their accomplices who had selected the 
rucksack as the hall-mark of all honorary citizens in this new State. 


They did not like the Revolution for its own sake, as many people still 
erroneously believe, but for the consequences which followed in its train. 


It was, however, very difficult to establish any abiding authority on the 
popular support given to these Marxist freebooters, and yet the young Republic 
stood in need of authority at any cost, unless it was prepared to be suddenly 
overthrown after a short period of chaos by an avenging force assembled from 
those last elements that still remained of the best extreme of the population. 


The danger which those who were responsible for the Revolution feared 
most at that time was that, in the turmoil of the confusion which they 
themselves had created, the ground would suddenly give under their feet, that 
they might be abruptly seized and transported to another milieu by an iron 
hand, such as has often made itself felt at such junctures in the history of 
nations. 


The Republic had to be consolidated at all costs. Hence, it was forced 
almost immediately after its foundation to erect another pillar beside that 
unstable pillar of its wavering popularity. Its promoters found that power must 
be organised once again in order to procure a firmer foundation for their 
authority. 


When those who had been the matadors of the Revolution in December 
1918, and January and February 1919, felt the ground trembling beneath their 


589 


feet they looked around them for men who would be prepared to support, by 
means of military force, the insecure position which their popularity with the 
public afforded them. 


The ‘anti-militarist? Republic had need of soldiers. Since, however, the 
first and only pillar on which the authority of the State rested, namely, its 
popularity, was grounded only on a conglomeration of rowdies, thieves, 
burglars, deserters, shirkers, etc., namely, on that section of the nation which 
we have called the evil extreme, it was useless to look to it to provide men 
who would be willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of a new ideal. 


The section which had nourished the revolutionary idea and carried out 
the Revolution was neither able nor willing to provide the men to protect it, for 
that section had no wish whatsoever to organise a republican State, but to 
disorganise what already existed in order the better to satisfy its own instincts. 


Their watchword was not the organisation and construction of the 
German Republic, but rather the pillaging of it. 


Hence, the cry for help, sent out by the public representatives, who were 
beset by a thousand anxieties, did not find any response among this class of 
people, but rather provoked a feeling of bitterness and repudiation. 


They looked upon this step as a breach of faith and trust, and in the 
building up of an authority which was no longer based on popular support, but 
also on force, they saw the beginning of a struggle against what was, for these 
elements, an essential factor of the Revolution, namely, the right to plunder and 
absolute domination by a horde of thieves and robbers in short, the worst 
rabble who had broken out of the convict prisons, leaving their chains behind. 


The representatives of the people might cry out as much as they liked, but 
they could get no help from that rabble and only the answering cry, ‘Traitors!’ 
revealed the attitude of the very people on whose support the popularity of the 
regime was founded. 


Then for the first time large numbers of young Germans were ready to 
don their military uniform once again in the service, as they believed, of ‘law 
and order,’ shouldering their rifles and donning their steel helmets, to defend 
the wreckers of the Fatherland. 


Volunteer corps were assembled and, although hating the Revolution, 
they set to work to defend and to establish it firmly. In doing this they acted in 


590 


perfect good faith. 


The real organiser of the Revolution and the actual wire-puller behind it, 
the international Jew, had sized up the situation correctly. 


The German people were not yet ripe to be drawn into the bloody 
swamp of Bolshevism, as the Russian people had been drawn. 


That was because there was a closer racial unity between the intellectual 
classes in Germany and the manual workers, and also because, as was also the 
case in the other States in Western Europe, broadly speaking, most classes of 
the community had their quota of cultured persons, whereas this was not the 
case in Russia. 


In that country the intellectual classes were, for the most part, not of 
Russian nationality, or at least they did not have the racial characteristics of the 
Slav. 


The thin upper layer of intellectuals which then existed in Russia could 
be abolished at any time, because there was no intermediate stratum connecting 
it organically with the great mass of the people. There the mental and moral 
level of the great mass of the people was extremely low. 


In Russia, the moment the agitators were successful in inciting the broad 
masses of the people, who could neither read nor write, against the upper layer 
of intellectuals who were not in contact with the masses or permanently linked 
with them in any way, the fate of Russia was decided, the success of the 
Revolution assured. 


Thereupon the analphabetic Russian became the slave of his Jewish 
dictators who, on their side, were shrewd enough to name their dictatorship 
‘the dictatorship of the people.’ 


In the case of Germany an additional factor must be taken into account. 
Here the Revolution could be carried into effect only if the Army could first be 
gradually dismembered. 


The real author of the Revolution and of the process of disintegration in 
the Army was not the soldier who had fought at the front, but canaille who 
more or less shunned the light and were either quartered in the home garrisons 
or were officiating as ‘indispensables’ somewhere in the business world at 
home. 


591 


This canaille was reinforced by ten thousand deserters who, without 
running any particular risk, could turn their backs on the fighting front. At all 
times the real coward fears nothing so much as death, but at the front he had 
death before his eyes every day in a thousand different shapes. 


There has always been one possible way, and one only, of making weak 
or wavering men, or even downright cowards, face their duty steadfastly and 
that 1s that the deserter be given to understand that his desertion will bring 
upon him just the very thing from which he is fleeing. 


At the front a man may die, but the deserter must die. Only this draconian 
threat against every attempt to desert the flag can have an intimidating effect, 
not merely on the individual, but also on the mass. Therein lay the meaning and 
purpose of the military penal code. 


It was a magnificent delusion, to believe that the great struggle for the 
life of a nation could be carried through if it were based solely on voluntary 
fidelity, arising from and sustained by the knowledge that such a struggle was 
necessary. 


The voluntary fulfilment of one’s duty is a motive that determines the 
actions of only the best men, but not of the average type of man. 


Hence, special laws are necessary, just as, for instance, the law against 
stealing, which was not made for men who are honest on principle, but for the 
weak and unstable elements. 


Such laws are meant to hinder the evil-doer by their deterrent effect and 
thus prevent a state of affairs from arising in which the honest man 1s 
considered stupid, and which would end in the belief that it is better to have a 
share in the robbery, than to stand by with empty hands or allow oneself to be 
robbed. 


It was a mistake to believe that in a struggle which, according to all 
human reckoning, might last for several years it would be possible to dispense 
with those expedients which the experience of hundreds and even of thousands 
of years had proved to be effective in making weak and unstable men face and 
fulfil their duty in difficult times and at moments of great nervous stress. 


For the voluntary war-hero it is, of course, not necessary to have the 
death-penalty in the military code, but it is necessary for the cowardly egotists 
who value their own lives above the existence of the community in the hour of 


592 


national need. 


Such weak and characterless people can be deterred from surrendering 
to their cowardice only by the application of the heaviest penalties. 


When men have to struggle with death every day and remain for weeks in 
trenches of mire, often very badly supplied with food, the man who is unsure of 
himself and begins to waver cannot be made to stick to his post by threats of 
imprisonment or even penal servitude. 


Only by a ruthless enforcement of the death-penalty can this be effected, 
for experience shows that at such a time the weakling considers prison a 
thousand times preferable to the battlefield. In prison his precious life is not in 
danger. 


The abolition of the death-penalty during the War, that is to say, the fact 
that the military penal code was, to all practical purposes, in abeyance, was a 
mistake for which we had to pay dearly. 


An army of deserters poured into the stations at the rear or returned 
home, especially in 1918, and there began to form that huge criminal 
organisation with which we were suddenly faced, after November 7th, 1918, 
and which engineered the Revolution. 


The front had nothing to do with all this. Naturally, the soldiers at the 
front were yearning for peace, but it was precisely that fact which represented 
a special danger for the Revolution, for when the German soldiers began to 
draw near home, after the Armistice, the revolutionaries, in trepidation, asked 
again and again, ‘What will the troops from the front do? Will the men in field- 
grey stand for it?’ 


During those weeks the Revolution was forced to give itself at least an 
external appearance of moderation, if it were not to run the risk of being 
speedily wrecked by a few German divisions. 


For at that time, had the commander of one single division made up his 
mind to rally the men of his command, who had always remained faithful to 
him, to participate in an onslaught, to tear down the red flag and put the 
‘councils’ against the wall, or, if there was any resistance, to break in with 
trench-mortars and hand-grenades, that division would have grown into an 
army of sixty divisions in less than four weeks. 


593 


The Jewish wire-pullers were terrified by the prospect more than by 
anything else, and to forestall this particular danger they found it necessary to 
give the Revolution a certain aspect of moderation. 


They dared not allow it to degenerate into Bolshevism, but, conditions 
being what they were, had to produce a semblance of ‘law and order’—hence 
many important concessions, the appeal to the old civil service and to the 
leaders of the old Army. 


They would be needed, at least for a certain time, and only when they 
had served their turn could they be dismissed with impunity and the Republic 
taken entirely cut of the hands of the old servants of the State and delivered 
into the clutches of the revolutionaries. 


They thought that this was the only means of duping the old generals and 
civil servants and of disarming beforehand any possible opposition through the 
apparently harmless and mild character of the new regime. Experience has 
shown to what extent the plot succeeded. 


The Revolution, however, was not made by the peaceful and orderly 
elements of the nation but rather by rioters, thieves and robbers, and the way in 
which the Revolution was developing did not accord with the intentions of 
these latter elements. 


Still, on tactical grounds, it was not possible to explain to them the 
reasons for the course things were taking and make that course acceptable. 


As Social Democracy gradually gained power, it lost more and more the 
character of a crude revolutionary party. Of course in their inner hearts the 
Social Democrats wanted a revolution and their leaders had no other end in 
view. 


The final result, however, was only a revolutionary programme and a 
body of men no longer capable of putting it into execution. 


A revolution cannot be carried through by a party often million members. 
In such a movement there is no longer a climax of activity, but merely the broad 
masses of the middle stratum, that is to say, inertia. 


Recognising all this, even during the War, the Jews brought about the 
famous split in the Social Democratic Party. While the Social Democratic 
Party, conforming to the inertia of its mass following, hung like a leaden weight 


594 


on the neck of the national defence, the actively radical elements were 
extracted from it and formed into a particularly efficient force for purposes of 
attack. 


The Independent Party and the Spartacist League were the storm- 
battalions of revolutionary Marxism. The objective assigned to them was to 
create a fait accompli, on the basis of which the masses of the Social 
Democratic Party could take their stand, having been prepared for this event 
long beforehand. 


The spineless bourgeoisie had been estimated at its just value by the 
Marxists and treated en canaille. Nobody bothered about it, knowing well that 
in their canine servility the representatives of an old and worn-out generation 
would not be able to offer any serious resistance. 


When the Revolution had succeeded and its engineers believed that the 
main pillars of the old State had been broken down, the Army returning from 
the front began to appear in the light of a sinister sphinx and thus made it 
necessary to slow down the natural course of the Revolution. 


The main body of the Social Democratic horde occupied the conquered 
positions, and the Independent and Spartacist storm-battalions were side- 
tracked. This was not, however, possible without a struggle. 


Not only were the active assault formations that had started the 
Revolution dissatisfied and, feeling that they had been betrayed, eager to 
continue the fight on their own account, but their unchecked racketeering was 
even approved by the wire-pullers of the Revolution, for the Revolution itself 
had scarcely been accomplished when it appeared to be divided into two 


camps. 


In the one camp were the elements of law and order; in the other, those of 
blood and terrorism. Was it not perfectly natural that our bourgeoisie should 
take up its stand with flying colours in the camp of law and order? 


For once these pitiable, political organisations found it possible to act, 
inasmuch as, although not admitting it, they had gained a first foothold and thus 
to a certain extent they found themselves in coalition with that power which 
they hated but feared. 


The German political bourgeoisie achieved the high honour of being able 
to associate itself with the accursed Marxist leaders for the purpose of 


595 


combating Bolshevism. 


Thus as early as December 1918 and January 1919 the situation was as 
follows: A minority consisting of the worst elements had engineered the 
Revolution, and behind this minority all the Marxist parties immediately fell 
into step. 


The Revolution itself had an outward appearance of moderation, which 
aroused the enmity of the fanatical extremists. These began to resort to the use 
of hand-grenades and machine-guns, occupying public buildings, and thus 
threatening to destroy the moderate trend of the Revolution. 


To prevent this terrorism from developing further a truce was concluded 
between the representatives of the new regime and the adherents of the old 
order, for the purpose of waging a common fight against the extremists. 


The result was that the enemies of the Republic ceased to oppose the 
Republic as such and helped to subjugate those who were also enemies of the 
Republic, though for quite different reasons, but a further consequence was that 
all danger of the adherents of the old State putting up a fight against the new 
was now definitely averted. This fact must always be borne in mind. 


Only by remembering it, can we understand how it was possible that a 
nation in which nine-tenths of the people had not joined in a revolution, while 
seven-tenths repudiated it and six-tenths detested it, allowed the Revolution to 
be imposed upon it by the remaining one-tenth of the population. 


Gradually the barricade heroes in the Spartacist camp petered out, and 
so did the nationalist patriots and idealists on the other side. As these two 
groups steadily dwindled, the masses of the middle stratum triumphed, as they 
always will. 


The bourgeoisie and the Marxists met together on the basis of a fait 
accompli and the Republic began to be consolidated. At first, however, that 
did not prevent the bourgeois parties from continuing to propound their 
monarchist ideas for some time, especially at the elections, whereby they 
endeavoured to conjure up the spirit of the dead past to encourage and win 
over once more their own feeble-hearted followers. 


It was not an honest proceeding. In their hearts they had broken with the 
monarchy long ago; but the foulness of the new regime had begun to extend its 
corruptive action and make itself felt in the camp of the bourgeois parties. 


596 


The common bourgeois politician now felt better in the slime of 
republican corruption than in the severe austerity of the defunct State, which 
still lived in his memory. 


As I have already pointed out, after the destruction of the old Army the 
revolutionary leaders were forced to strengthen the authority of the State by 
creating a new factor of power. 


In the conditions that existed they could do this only by winning over to 
their side the adherents of a Weltanschauung which was diametrically 
opposed to their own. 


From those elements alone was it possible slowly to create a new Army, 
limited numerically by the peace treaties, whose spirit had to undergo a 
transformation, before it could become an instrument of the new regime. If, 
setting aside the very real defects of the old State, which undoubtedly 
constituted a contributory factor, we ask ourselves how it was possible for the 
revolutionary action to succeed, we arrive at the following conclusions: 


Firstly, it was due to the petrifaction of our sense of duty and obedience. 


Secondly, it was due also to the passive timidity of the parties who were 
supposed to uphold the State. 


Moreover, it should be emphasised that the process of petrifaction of our 
sense of duty and obedience was fundamentally due to our wholly non-national 
and purely State education which resulted in a confusion of the conceptions 
‘means’ and ‘ends.’ 


Consciousness of duty, fulfilment of duty and obedience, are not ends in 
themselves any more than the State is an end in itself, but they all ought to be 
employed as means to facilitate and assure the existence of a community of 
people who are physically and mentally akin. 


At a moment when a nation is manifestly collapsing and when all 
outward signs show that it is on the point of becoming the victim of ruthless 
oppression, thanks to the conduct of a few miscreants, to obey these people and 
fulfil one’s appointed task is merely doctrinaire formalism, and indeed pure 
folly. 


On the other hand, refusal to obey and to ‘fulfil one’s appointed task’ in 
such a case might save the nation from collapse. 


597 


According to our current bourgeois idea of the State, a divisional general 
who received from his superior the order not to shoot fulfilled his duty and 
therefore acted rightly in not shooting, because, to the bourgeois mind blind 
obedience is more valuable than the life of a nation. 


But, according to the National Socialist concept it is not a sense of 
obedience to weak superiors that should prevail at such moments. In such an 
hour the duty of assuming personal responsibility towards the whole nation 
arises. 


The Revolution succeeded because that concept had ceased to be a vital 
force with our people, or rather with our governments, and lead given place to 
something that was merely formal and doctrinaire. 


As regards the second point, it may be said that the real reason for the 
cowardly attitude of the parties which supported the former State was that the 
most active and upright section of our people had been killed during the War. 


Apart from that, the bourgeois parties, which may be considered as the 
only political formations that stood by the old State, were convinced that they 
ought to defend their principles only by intellectual ways and means, since the 
use of physical force was permitted only to the State. That outlook was a sign 
of the weakness and decadence which had been gradually developing, and it 
was also senseless at a period when there was a political adversary in the 
field who had long ago abandoned that standpoint and had instead openly 
declared that he meant to attain his political ends by force whenever possible. 


When Marxism appeared in the world of bourgeois democracy, as a 
consequence of that democracy itself, the appeal sent out by the bourgeois 
democracy to fight Marxism with intellectual weapons was a piece of folly for 
which terrible expiation had to be made later on. Marxism always professed 
the doctrine that the choice of weapons was a matter which had to be decided 
from the standpoint of expediency and that success justified the choice of the 
weapon. 


This idea was proved correct during the days from November 7th to 
11th, 1918. At that time the Marxists did not bother themselves in the least 
about parliament or democracy, but gave the death-blow to both by turning 
loose their horde of criminals to shoot and raise hell. 


It was, therefore, only natural that the long-winded bourgeois 


598 


organisations were forthwith rendered defenceless. 


When the Revolution was over, the bourgeois parties changed the name 
of their firm and suddenly reappeared, the heroic leaders emerging from the 
dark cellars or more airy storehouses where they had sought refuge. 


But, just as happens in the case of all representatives of antiquated 
institutions, they had not forgotten their errors or learned anything new. 


Their political programme was grounded in the past, even though they 
themselves had become reconciled to the new regime. 


Their aim was to secure, if possible, a share in the new institution, and 
so they continued to use words as their sole weapon. 


Therefore, after the Revolution the bourgeois parties also capitulated to 
the mob in a miserable fashion. 


When the Law for the Protection of the Republic was introduced the 
majority was not at first in favour of it, but, confronted with two hundred 
thousand Marxists demonstrating in the streets, tine bourgeois ‘statesmen’ were 
so terror stricken that they voted for the law against their better judgment, for 
the edifying reason that they feared they might otherwise be beaten up by the 
enraged masses on leaving the Reichstag—something which unfortunately did 
not occur upon the law being passed. 


Thus, the new State developed along its own lines, as if there had been 
no national opposition at all. 


The only organisations which might at that time have had the strength and 
courage to face Marxism and its incited masses were, first of all, the Freikorps 
and subsequently the organisations for self-defence, the civic guards, and 
finally, the ex-servicemen’s association. For the following reasons the 
existence of these bodies did not appreciably change the course of German 
history. Just as the so-called national parties were unable to take any steps 
since they lacked an efficient force to deal with the mob, the defence leagues 
were likewise unable to exert any influence because they had no political ideal 
and especially because they had no definite political aim in view. 


The success which Marxism had scored was due to perfect co-operation 
between political determination and ruthless force. 


599 


What prevented nationalist Germany from taking a hand in shaping 
developments was the lack of determined co-operation between brute force 
and inspired political aims. 


Whatever may have been the aspirations of the ‘national’ parties, they 
had no force whatsoever to fight for these aspiration least of all in the streets. 


The power lay in the hands of the defence leagues. They were masters of 
the street and of the State, but they lacked political ideals and aims on behalf of 
which their forces could have been mobilised in the interests of the German 
nation. 


In both cases, the cunning Jew was able by his astute powers of 
persuasion, to make this unfortunate state of affairs permanent or at least to 
aggravate it. 


The Jew succeeded brilliantly in using his press for the purpose of 
spreading abroad the idea that the defence leagues were of a ‘non-political 
character,’ just as in politics he was always astute enough to praise the ‘purely 
intellectual’ character of the struggle and demand that it must always be kept on 
that plane. 


Millions of German imbeciles then repeated this folly, without having the 
slightest suspicion that by so doing, they were, to all practical purposes, 
disarming themselves and delivering themselves defenceless into the hands of 
the Jew. 


There is a natural explanation of this also. The lack of a great ideal 
capable of re-moulding conditions has always meant a limitation of fighting 
power. 


The conviction of the right to employ even the most brutal weapons is 
always associated with an ardent faith in the necessity for the triumph of a new 
and revolutionary order of things on this earth. 


A movement which does not fight for such high aims and ideals will 
never have recourse to extreme means. The appearance of a new and great 
ideal was the secret of the success of the French Revolution. 


The Russian Revolution owes its triumph to an ideal, and it was only the 
ideal that enabled Fascism to bestow on a whole nation the blessing of a 
complete reformation. 


600 


Bourgeois parties are not capable of such an achievement, and it was not 
the bourgeois parties alone whose political aim was a restoration of the past. 


This was also the aim of the defence leagues, in so far as they concerned 
themselves with political aims at all. The spirit of the old war legions and 
Kyffhauser traditions lived on in them and thereby helped to blunt, from the 
political point of view, these, the sharpest weapons which nationalist Germany 
then possessed and to, allow them to degenerate to the level of slaves of the 
Republic. 


The fact that these leagues were inspired by the best of intentions in so 
doing, and certainly acted in good faith, does not alter in the slightest degree 
the foolishness of the course they adopted. 


In the consolidated Reichswehr, Marxism gradually acquired the support 
of force, which it needed for the exercise of its authority. 


As a logical consequence it proceeded to abolish the defence leagues, 
which it considered dangerous, declaring that they were now no longer 
necessary. Some particularly bold leaders who were regarded with suspicion 
were tried and sent to prison, but even so, Fate dealt with them as they 
deserved. 


With the founding of the National Socialist German Labour Party there 
came into being for the first time a movement whose aim, unlike that of the 
bourgeois parties, was not mechanically to restore the past, but to set up in 
place of the absurd State machinery of the present day an organic volkisch 
State. 


From the outset the new Movement took its stand on the principle that its 
ideas had to be propagated by intellectual means but that, when necessary, 
force would be employed in support of its propaganda. 


In accordance with their conviction of the paramount importance of the 
new doctrine, the leaders of the new Movement naturally believe that no 
sacrifice can be considered too great when it is a question of carrying out the 
purpose of the Movement. 


I have emphasised that in certain circumstances a movement which is 
meant to win the hearts of the people must be ready to defend itself with its 
own forces against terrorist attempts on the part of its adversaries. 


601 


It has invariably happened in the history of the world that formal State 
authority has failed to break a reign of terror which was inspired by a 
Weltanschauung. It can only be overcome by a new and different 
Weltanschauung whose representatives are quite as bold and determined. 


Recognition of this fact has always been very unpleasant for the 
bureaucrats who are the protectors of the State, but the fact remains 
nevertheless. 


The rulers of the State can guarantee law and order only if the 
constitution coincides absolutely with the prevailing Weltanschauung so that 
disturbing elements merely assume the character of isolated criminals, instead 
of being considered as the champions of an ideal which is diametrically 
opposed to the State ideology. 


In the latter case the State may employ the most violent measures for 
centuries against the terrorism that threatens it; but in the end all these 
measures will prove futile, and the State will have to succumb. The German 
State was systematically attacked by Marxism. In a struggle that went on for 
seventy years the State was not able to prevent the triumph of the Marxist idea. 


Even though the sentences to penal servitude and imprisonment amounted 
in all to thousands of years, and even though the most sanguinary measures 
were, in innumerable instances, adopted against the champions of the Marxist 
Weltanschauung, which threatened its safety, in the end the State was forced to 
capitulate almost completely. 


The ordinary bourgeois political leaders will deny all this, but in vain. 
The State which capitulated unconditionally to Marxism on November 9th, 
1918, will not suddenly arise again tomorrow as the conqueror of Marxism— 
far from it! 


Bourgeois simpletons sitting on office stools in the various ministries 
babble about the necessity of not governing against the wishes of the workers 
and by the word ‘workers’ they mean the Marxists. 


By identifying the German worker with Marxism not only are they guilty 
of a vile distortion of the truth, but they are attempting to conceal the fact of 
their own collapse before the Marxist idea and the Marxist organisation. 


In view of the complete subordination of the present State to Marxism, 
the National Socialist Movement feels all the more bound, not only to prepare 


602 


the way for the triumph of its ideal by appealing to the reason and 
understanding of the public, but also to take upon itself the responsibility of 
organising its own defence against the terrorism of the International, which 1s 
intoxicated with its own victory. 


I have already described how the practical experience gained by our 
young Movement led us slowly to organise a system of defence at our 
meetings. 


This gradually assumed the character of a military body specially trained 
for the maintenance of order and tended to develop into a service having its 
properly organised cadres. 


This new formation might resemble the defence leagues externally, but in 
reality there were no grounds of comparison between the one and the other. 


As I have already said, the German defence leagues had no definite 
political ideas of their own. They were really only associations formed for 
purposes of self-defence, their training and organisation being more or less 
efficient so that they were an illegal complement or auxiliary to the legal 
forces of the State. 


Their Freikorps character arose only from the manner of their 
organisation and the situation in which the State found itself at that time, but 
they certainly could not claim to be Freikorps on the grounds that they were 
associations formed voluntarily and privately for the purpose of fighting for 
their own independent political convictions. 


Such they were not, despite the fact that some of their leaders and some 
associations as such were definitely opposed to the Republic, for before we 
can speak of political convictions in the higher sense, we must be something 
more than merely convinced that the existing regime is defective. 


Political convictions in the higher sense mean that a man has a clear 
conception and profound understanding of the form of a new regime and feels 
that the establishment of this regime is an absolute necessity and one which he 
regards as the aim of his life’s work. 


The body of men organised for the preservation of order, which was then 
formed under the National Socialist Movement, was fundamentally different 
from all the other defence associations. 


603 


This was by reason of the fact that our formations were not meant in any 
way to defend the state of things created by the Revolution, but rather that they 
were meant exclusively to support our struggle for the creation of a new 
Germany. 


In the beginning this body was merely a guard to maintain order at our 
meetings. Its first task was limited to making it possible for us to hold our 
meetings, which our opponents would otherwise have made completely 
unfeasible. 


These men were at that time trained to attack in blind obedience to 
orders but not, as was then pretended in stupid German patriotic circles, to 
revere the baton as the highest ideal, because they were aware that the highest 
ideals can be brought to naught if their champion 1s hit over the head witha 
club, since it has happened not infrequently in the course of history that great 
men have perished under the blows of the most insignificant helots. 


Our body-guards did not look upon violence as an end in itself, but they 
protected the protagonists of ideal aims and purposes against hostile coercion 
by means of violence. 


They also understood that there was no obligation to undertake the 
defence of a State which did not guarantee the defence of the nation, but that, 
on the contrary, they had to defend the nation against those who were 
threatening to destroy nation and State. 


After the fight which took place at the meeting in the Miinchener 
Hofbrauhaus, where the small number of our guards who were present won 
everlasting fame for themselves by the heroic manner in which they stormed 
their adversaries, these guards were called the Storm Detachment. 


As the name itself indicates, they represent only a detachment of the 
Movement. They form one constituent element of it, as do the press, the 
propaganda, scientific institutes or other sections of the Party. 


We learned how necessary was the formation of such a body, not only 
from our experience on the occasion of that memorable meeting, but also when 
we sought gradually to carry the Movement beyond Munich and extend it to the 
other parts of Germany. Once we had begun to appear as a danger to Marxism, 
the Marxists lost no opportunity of trying to quash beforehand all preparations 
for the holding of National Socialist meetings. 


604 


When they did not succeed in this they tried to break up the meeting 
itself. It goes without saying that all, the Marxist organisations, no matter of 
what grade, blindly supported every move and action of this nature taken by 
their representatives. 


What can be said for the bourgeois parties which, when they had been 
reduced to silence by these same Marxists and in many places did not dare to 
let their speakers appear before the public, were, nevertheless, childishly and 
incomprehensibly delighted, every time we received any kind of set-back in 
our fight against Marxism? 


The bourgeois parties were happy to think that those whom they 
themselves could not oppose and to whom they had been forced to capitulate, 
could not be broken by us. 


What can be said for those State officials, chief of police, and even 
cabinet ministers, who showed a scandalous lack of principle in presenting 
themselves to the public as ‘nationalists’ and yet unashamedly played the part 
of henchmen to the Marxists in the disputes which we, the National Socialists, 
had with the latter? 


What can be said for persons who, for the sake of a little abject praise in 
the Jewish Press, debased themselves so far as to persecute those men to 
whose heroic courage and intervention, regardless of risk, they were partly 
indebted for not having been torn to pieces by the ‘Red’ mob a few years 
previously and strung up to the lamp-posts? 


One day these lamentable phenomena forced the late but unforgotten 
Prefect Pohner (a man whose unflinching honesty forced him to hate all 
twisters and to hate them as only an honourable man can hate) to say, ‘All my 
life I wished to be first a German and then an official, and I never wanted to be 
taken for one of those creatures who, like prostitutes, sold themselves body 
and soul to anybody who could play lord and master for the time being.’ 


It was extremely sad that gradually tens of thousands of honest and loyal 
servants of the State did not only come under the power of such people, but 
were also slowly contaminated by their unprincipled morals. 


Moreover, men of this kind pursued honest officials with a furious 
hatred, hounding them out of their jobs, while passing themselves off as 
‘nationalist’ with the aid of their lying hypocrisy. 


605 


From officials of that kind we could expect no support, and only in very 
rare instances was it given. Only by building up its own defence could our 
Movement become secure and attract that amount of public attention and 
general respect which is given to those who can defend themselves when 
attacked. 


We decided that, as an underlying principle in the internal development 
of the Storm Detachment, it should not only be perfectly trained as regards 
physical fitness, but that the men should be so instructed as to make them 
indomitably convinced champions of the National Socialist ideals and, finally, 
that they should be schooled to observe the strictest discipline. 


This body was to have nothing to do either with the defence 
organisations of the bourgeois type or with any secret organisation. 


Even at that time my reasons for guarding strictly against allowing the 
Storm Detachment of the National Socialist German Labour Party, to be 
organised on the lines of a defence league were as follows: 


On purely practical grounds it is impossible to build up a national 
defence organisation by means of private associations, unless the State makes 
an enormous contribution to it. Whoever thinks otherwise over-estimates his 
own powers. 


Now, it is entirely out of the question to form organisations of any 
military value for a definite purpose on the principle of so-called ‘voluntary 
discipline.’ 


Here the chief support for, the enforcement of orders, namely, the power 
to inflict punishment, 1s lacking. In the autumn, or rather in the spring, of 1919 
it was still possible to raise so-called Freikorps, not only because most of the 
men who came forward at that time had been through the school of the old 
Army, but also because the kind of duty imposed there constrained the 
individual to absolute obedience, at least for a definite period of time. 


That spirit is entirely lacking in the volunteer defence organisations of 
to-day. The larger the defence league grows, the weaker its discipline becomes 
and so much less can be demanded of the individual members. 


Thus, the whole organisation will assume more and more the character 
of the old non-political associations of ex-servicemen and veterans. 


606 


To attempt to instruct in military duties a large number of men who have 
volunteered to undergo such training, is impossible without the backing of 
absolute power to issue commands. 


There will always be very few men who will voluntarily and 
spontaneously submit to that kind of discipline which is considered natural and 
necessary in the Army. 


Moreover, a proper system of military training cannot be developed 
where the funds available are as ridiculously scanty as those at the disposal of 
the defence leagues. 


The principal task of such an institution must be to impart the best and 
most reliable kind of instruction. Eight years have passed since the end of the 
War, and during that time none of our German youth, at an age when formerly 
they would have had to do military service, have received any systematic 
training at all. 


The aim of a defence league cannot be to enlist all those who have 
already received a military training, since in that case it could be reckoned 
with mathematical accuracy when the last member would leave the league. 


Even the youngest soldier of 1918 will not be fit for front-line service 
twenty years later, and we are approaching that state of affairs with a rapidity 
that gives cause for anxiety. 


Thus the defence leagues must assume more and more the aspect of the 
old ex-service men’s association, but that cannot be the meaning and purpose 
of an institution which calls itself, not an association of ex-service men but a 
defence league. 


By that title it considers its task to be to preserve the tradition of the old 
soldiers and hold them together, to propagate the idea of national defence, and 
be able to put this idea into practice—which means the creation of a body of 
men who are fit and trained for military defence. 


In order to fulfil this condition, it is, however, necessary that those 
elements receive a military training which up to now have received none. 


This is something that, in practice, is impossible for the defence leagues 
to accomplish. Real soldiers cannot be made by training men for one or two 
hours per week. 


607 


In view of the enormously increasing demands which modern warfare 
imposes on each individual soldier to-day a military service of two years is 
barely sufficient to transform a raw recruit into a trained soldier. 


At the front during the War we all saw the fearful consequences which 
our young recruits had to suffer from their lack of a thorough military training. 


Volunteer formations which had been drilled for fifteen to twenty weeks 
under iron discipline and shown unlimited self-sacrificing enthusiasm proved 
nevertheless to be no better than cannon-fodder at the front. 


Only when distributed among the ranks of the old and experienced 
soldiers did the young recruits, who had been trained for four to six months, 
become useful members of a regiment. Guided by the ‘old stagers,’ they 
adapted themselves gradually to their task. 


In the light of all this, how hopeless must be any attempt to create a body 
of fighting troops by a so-called training of one to two hours in the week, 
without any definite power to enforce commands and without sufficient means. 


It might be possible to give old soldiers a ‘refresher course’ of this kind, 
but raw recruits cannot be turned into useful soldiers in this way. 


How such a proceeding produces utterly worthless results may also be 
strikingly demonstrated by the fact that, while these so-called volunteer 
defence leagues, by dint of tremendous effort and after overcoming many 
difficulties, train, or attempt to train, a few thousand willing men (the others 
being beyond their reach) for national defence; the State, through its pacifist- 
cum-democratic education, perverts the natural instincts of millions of young 
men, poisons their logical sense of patriotism and gradually turns them into a 
herd of sheep who will patiently follow any arbitrary command. 


In the face of all this how ridiculous are all the attempts made by defence 
leagues to inculcate their ideas upon the minds of the German youth! 


Almost more important is the following consideration, which has always 
made me take up a stand against all attempts at a so-called military training on 
the basis of the volunteer associations. 


Assuming that, in spite of all the difficulties just mentioned, a defence 
league were successful in training a certain number of Germans every year to 
be efficient soldiers, with regards to mental outlook, physical fitness and the 


608 


expert handling of arms; the result must necessarily be null and void in a State 
whose whole tendency makes it look upon such a defensive organisation as 
undesirable and even intolerable—because such an organisation would be in 
complete contradiction to the secret aims of the political leaders, who are the 
corruptors of this State. 


Such a result would, in any case, be worthless under governments which 
have demonstrated by their own acts that they do not attach the slightest 
importance to the military power of the nation and are not disposed to have 
recourse to that power unless for the preservation of their own existence on 
earth. 


That is the state of affairs to-day. Is it not ridiculous to think of training 
some ten thousand men in the use of arms, and to carry on that training 
surreptitiously, when a few years previously the State, having shamefully 
sacrificed eight and a half million highly trained soldiers, not merely did not 
require their services any longer but, as a mark of gratitude for their faithful 
service, held them up to public contumely? 


Shall we train soldiers for a regime which besmirched and spat upon our 
most glorious soldiers, tore the medals and badges from their breasts, trampled 
on their flags and derided their achievements? 


Has the present regime taken one step towards restoring the honour of the 
old Army and making those who destroyed and outraged it answer for their 
deeds? Not in the least. 


On the contrary, the people I have just referred to may be seen enthroned 
in the highest governmental positions to-day, and yet it was said at Leipzig, 
‘Right is might.’ 

Since, however, in our Republic to-day might is in the hands of the very 
men who started the Revolution, and since that Revolution represents a most 
despicable act of high treason against the nation yes the vilest act in German 
history—there can surely be no grounds for saying that the might of these men 
should be enhanced by the formation of a new young army. It is against all 
sound reason. 


The importance which this State attached, after the Revolution of 1918, 
to the reinforcement of its position from the military point of view is clearly 
and unmistakably demonstrated by its attitude towards the large self-defence 


609 


organisations which existed at that period. 


They were not unwelcome as long as they were of use for the protection 
of the miserable creatures who had come into power with the Revolution. 


As soon as the danger threatening these creatures seemed to be on the 
decrease, thanks to the gradual debasement of our people, and the existence of 
the defence leagues represented a national-political strengthening factor, they 
became superfluous and every effort was made to disarm them and suppress 
them wherever that was possible. 


History records but few examples of gratitude on the part of princes and 
only a patriot belonging to the new bourgeoisie would dream of counting on the 
gratitude of revolutionary incendiaries and assassins, who have enriched 
themselves by robbing the public and by betraying the nation. 


On examining the problem as to the wisdom of forming these defence 
leagues, I could not refrain from asking: ‘For whom shall I train these young 
men? For what purpose will they be employed and when are they to be called 
out?’ 


The answer to these questions provides the best rule for us to follow. 


If the present State should one day call upon trained troops of this kind it 
would never be for the purpose of defending the interests of the nation against 
the foreigner, but rather to protect the oppressors of the nation within the 
country against the danger of a general outbreak of wrath on the part of a nation 
which has been deceived and betrayed and whose interests have been bartered 
away. 


For this reason it was decided that the Storm Detachment of the National 
Socialist German Labour Party ought not to be in the nature of a military 
organisation. 


It had to be an instrument of protection and education for the National 
Socialist Movement and its duties lay in quite a different sphere to those of the 
military defence association. Moreover, the Storm Detachment was not to be in 
the nature of a secret organisation. 


Secret organisations are established only for purposes that are illegal, 
and the purpose of such an organisation is limited by its very nature. 


610 


Considering the loquacious propensities of the German people, it is not 
possible to build up any vast organisation, at the same time keeping it secret or 
disguising its purpose. 


Every attempt of that kind is destined to turn out absolutely futile. 


It is not merely that our political officials to-day have at their disposal a 
staff of informers and other such rabble who are ready to play traitor, like 
Judas, for thirty pieces of silver and will betray whatever secrets they can 
discover and will invent what they do not know, for the sake of having 
something to reveal, but one’s own followers cannot be relied upon to maintain 
the silence necessary in such circumstances. 


Only small groups can become really secret societies, and that only after 
long years of selective elimination, but the very smallness of such groups 
would deprive them of all value for the National Socialist Movement. 


What we needed then, and need now, is not one or two hundred dare- 
devil conspirators, but hundreds of thousands of devoted champions of our 
Weltanschauung. 


The work must not be done through secret conventicles, but through 
impressive mass demonstrations in public. Dagger and pistol and poison-vial 
cannot clear the way for the progress of the Movement; that can be done only 
by winning over the man in the street. 


We must teach the Marxists that, in future, National Socialism will be 
master of the street, just as it will one day become master of the State. 


There is another danger connected with secret societies, It lies in the fact 
that their members often completely misunderstand the greatness of the task in 
hand and are apt to believe that the destiny of the nation can be assured 
overnight by the assassination of a, single man. 


Such a belief may find historical justification in cases where a nation 
had been suffering under the tyranny of some oppressor who at the same time 
was a man of genius and whose extraordinary personality was the sole 
guarantee for the continuance and frightfulness of his terrible oppression. 


In such cases a man may suddenly arise from the ranks of the people who 
is ready to sacrifice himself and plunge his deadly steel into the heart of the 
hated individual. 


611 


In order to look upon such a deed with horror one must have the 
republican mentality of petty rogues conscious of their own crime, but Schiller, 
the greatest poet-champion of liberty that the German people have ever had, 
has glorified such a deed in his ‘Wilhelm Tell.’ 


During 1919 and 1920 there was a danger that the members of secret 
organisations, under the influence of great historical examples and overcome 
by the immensity of the nations misfortunes, might attempt to wreak vengeance 
on the destroyers of their country, in the belief that this would end the miseries 
of the people. 


All such attempts were sheer folly, by reason of the fact that the Marxist 
triumph was not due to the superior genius of one remarkable person, but rather 
to immeasurable incompetence and cowardly shirking on the part of the 
bourgeoisie. 


The hardest criticism that can be uttered against our bourgeoisie 1s 
simply to state the fact that it submitted to the Revolution, even though the 
Revolution did not produce one single man of outstanding worth. 


One can, after all, understand how it was possible to capitulate to a 
Robespierre, a Danton, or a Marat; but it was utterly scandalous to go down on 
all fours before the withered Scheidemann, the obese Herr Erzberger, 
Friedrich Ebert, and the innumerable other political pygmies of the Revolution. 


There was not a single man of parts in whom one could see the 
revolutionary man of genius. Therein lay the country’s misfortune, for they 
were only revolutionary Spartacist vermin wholesale and retail. 


To put one of them out of the way was of little avail, as the only result 
was that another pair of blood-suckers, equally fat and thirsty, was ready to 
take his place. During those years we had to take up a determined stand against 
an attitude which had its origin and justification in genuinely great historical 
phenomena, but which did not, in the least, suit our present pigmy age. 


The same holds good in cases where it is a question of ‘bumping’ a so- 
called traitor to his country. 


It would be ridiculous and illogical to shoot a poor wretch who had 
betrayed the position of a gun to the enemy while the highest positions in the 
government are occupied by a rabble who bartered away a whole empire, who 
have on their consciences the deaths of two million men who were sacrificed 


612 


in vain, fellows who were responsible for the millions maimed in the war, but 
who, nevertheless, continue unperturbed to ‘make a good thing’ out of the 
republican regime without allowing their conscience to be disturbed in any 
way. 


It would be absurd to do away with small traitors ina State whose 
government absolves traitors on a large scale from all punishment. For it might 
easily happen that one day an honest idealist, who, out of love for his country, 
had removed some miserable informer who had betrayed the whereabouts of 
secret stores of arms was called upon to answer for his act before the chief 
traitors of the country. 


There is yet another important question, namely, 1s some petty traitorous 
wretch to meet death at the bands of another petty traitor, or of an idealist? 


In the former case the result would be doubtful and the deed would 
almost surely be revealed later on. 


In the second case an unworthy rascal is put out of the way, but the life of 
an idealist who may be irreplaceable is placed in jeopardy. 


For my own part, I believe that small thieves should not be hanged while 
big thieves are allowed go free. 


One day a national tribunal will have to judge and sentence some tens of 
thousands of organisers who were responsible for the criminal November 
betrayal and all the consequences that followed on it. Such an example will 
teach the necessary lesson, once, and for ever, to such as those paltry traitors 
who revealed to the enemy the places where arms were hidden. 


On the grounds of these considerations I steadfastly forbade all 
participation in secret societies, and I took care that the Storm Detachment 
should not assume such a character. 


During those years I prevented the National Socialist Movement from 
making experiments such as were being undertaken by young Germans who 
were, for the most part, inspired by a sublime idealism, but who became the 
victims of their own actions, without being able to ameliorate the lot of their 
Fatherland in the slightest degree. 


If, then, the Storm Detachment must not be either a military defence 
organisation or a secret society, we arrive at the following conclusion: 


613 


Firstly, its training must not be organised from the military standpoint, 
but from the point of view of what is most practical for party purposes. 


In so far as the members have to undergo a thorough physical training, 
attention must not be focussed mainly on military drill, but rather on the 
practice of sports. 


I have always considered boxing and ju-jitsu more important than 
training in rifle shooting, which, if inadequate, is definitely bad. 


If the German nation were presented with a body of six million young 
men who had been perfectly trained in athletic sports, who were imbued with 
an ardent love of their country and were ready to take the initiative in a fight, 
then the nationalist State could make an army out of that body within less than 
two years, if necessary, provided the cadres already existed. 


The situation being what it is to-day, the cadres would be furnished only 
by the Reichswehr, and not by a defence league that was neither one thing nor 
the other. 


Physical fitness must develop in the individual a conviction of his 
superiority and give him that confidence which is always based only on the 
consciousness of one’s own prowess. 


It must also develop that athletic agility which can be employed as a 
defensive weapon in the service of the Movement. 


Secondly, in order to safeguard the Storm Detachment against acquiring a 
secret character, the uniform must not only be such that it can immediately be 
recognised by everybody, but the large number of its members must serve as an 
indication of a course of action which is of advantage to the Movement and is 
known to the general public. 


The members of the Storm Detachment must not hold secret gatherings, 
but must march in the open and thus be employed in a manner which will put an 
end to all legends about a secret organisation in order to prevent them from 
finding an outlet for their mental energies in small conspiracies. 


We had from the very beginning to inculcate upon their minds the great 
idea behind the Movement and to educate them so thoroughly in the task of 
defending this idea that their horizon became enlarged and the individual no 
longer considered it his mission to ‘remove’ some rascal or other, whether big 


614 


or small, but to devote himself entirely to the task of bringing about the 
establishment of a new National Socialist volkisch State. 


In this way the struggle against the present State was placed on a higher 
plane than that of petty revenge and small conspiracies. 


It was elevated to the level of a spiritual struggle on behalf of a 
Weltanschauung, for the destruction of Marxism in all its shapes and forms. 


Thirdly, the form of organisation adopted for the Storm Detachment, as 
well as its uniform and equipment, had to be on a different model from those of 
the old Army. 


They had to be specially adapted to the task that was assigned to the 
Storm Detachment. 


These were the ideas I followed out in 1920 and 1921. I endeavoured to 
instil them gradually into the members of the young organisation, with the result 
that by the midsummer of 1922 we had a goodly number of formations each 
consisting of a hundred men. 


By the late autumn of that year these formations received their distinctive 
uniforms. There were three events which turned out to be of supreme 
importance for the subsequent development of the Storm Detachment. 


The first was the great mass demonstration against the Law for the 
Protection of the Republic held in the late summer of 1922 in the Konigsplatz 
in Munich. 


The patriotic associations of Munich had announced the holding of a 
gigantic mass demonstration as a protest against the introduction of the Law for 
the Protection of the Republic. The National Socialist Movement also 
participated. 


Our Party marched into the Square, in serried ranks, led by six Munich 
Storm Detachment units followed by the political sections of the Party. 


Two bands marched with us and about fifteen banners were carried. 
When the National Socialists arrived at the great square it was already half 
full, but no banners were displayed. 


Our arrival aroused unbounded enthusiasm. I myself had the honour of 
being one of the speakers who addressed that crowd of about sixty thousand 


615 


people. 


The demonstration was an overwhelming success, especially because it 
was proved for the first time that nationalist Munich could march through the 
streets, in spite of all threats from the Reds. 


Members of the organisation for the defence of the Red Republic 
endeavoured to hinder the marching columns by their terrorist activities, but 
they were scattered by the companies of the Storm Detachment within a few 
minutes and sent packing. The National Socialist Movement then showed for 
the first time that in future it was determined to exercise its right to march 
through the streets and thus deprive the international traitors and enemies of the 
country of their monopoly of this privilege. 


The events of that, day provided incontestable proof that our views on 
the creation of the Storm Detachment were right, both from the psychological 
standpoint and from the point of view of organisation. 


The principle having thus been proved correct we pushed on with the 
establishment of Storm Detachment units so that within a few weeks the 
number of Munich units was doubled. 


The second event was the expedition to Coburg in October 1922. Certain 
so-called vélkisch societies had decided to hold a German Rally at Coburg. 


I was invited to take part, with the intimation that they wished me to 
bring a following along. This invitation, which I received at eleven o’clock in 
the morning, arrived just in time. 


Within an hour the arrangements for our participation in the German 
Rally were completed. I picked eight hundred men of the Storm Detachment to 
accompany me. 


These were divided into about fourteen companies and were to be 
conveyed by special train from Munich to Coburg, which had become a part of 
Bavaria. Corresponding orders were given to other groups of the National 
Socialist Storm Detachment which had meanwhile been formed in various 
other localities. 


This was the first time that a special train for us was run in Germany. At 
all the places where the new units of the Storm Detachment joined us, our train 
caused a sensation. 


616 


Many of the people had never seen our banner and it created a very great 
impression. 


When we arrived at the station in Coburg we were received by a 
deputation of the organising committee of the German Rally. 


They announced that by order of the local trade-unions—that is to say, 
the Independent and Communist Parties—it had been ‘arranged’ that we should 
not enter the town with our banners unfurled and our band playing (we had a 
hand consisting of forty-two musicians with us) and that we should not march 
in formation. 


I immediately rejected these undignified conditions and did not fail to 
declare to the gentlemen who had arranged this ‘rally’ how astonished I was at 
the idea of their negotiating with such people and coming to an arrangement 
with them. 


Then I announced that the Storm Troops would immediately march into 
the town in company formation, with flags flying and band playing—which we 
proceeded to do forthwith. 


As we emerged in to the station square we were met by a hissing, yelling 
mob of several thousands, which greeted us with shouts of: ‘Assassins!’ 
‘Bandits!’ ‘Robbers!’ ‘Criminals!’ These were the choice names which these 
exemplary founders of the German Republic showered on us. 


The young Storm Detachment gave a fine exhibition of discipline. The 
companies fell into formation in the square in front of the station and at first 
took no notice of the insults hurled at them by the mob. 


The police were anxious. They did not pilot us to the quarters assigned 
to us on the outskirts of Coburg, a city quite unknown to us, but to the 
Hofbrauhaus-Keller in the centre of the town. 


To right and left of us as we marched the tumult raised by the 
accompanying mob steadily increased. 


Scarcely had the last company entered the courtyard of the Hofbrauhaus 
when the huge mob made a rush to get in after them, shouting madly. 


In order to prevent this, the police locked the gates. Seeing that the 
position was untenable I called the Storm Detachment to attention spoke a few 


617 


words to them and then asked the police to open the gates immediately. 
After a good deal of hesitation; they consented. 


We now marched back along the same route by which we had come, in 
the direction of our quarters and there we had to make a stand against the 
crowd. 


As their cries and yells all along the route had failed to disturb the 
equanimity of our companies, the champions of true Socialism, Equality, and 
Fraternity, now took to throwing stones. 


That brought our patience to an end. For ten minutes blows fell right and 
left, like a devastating shower of hail. Fifteen minutes later there were no Reds 
to be seen in the street. 


After nightfall serious clashes occurred. Patrols of the Storm Detachment 
had discovered National Socialists who had been attacked singly and were in 
a dangerous condition. 


Thereupon we made short work of the opponents. By the following 
morning the Red Terror, under which Coburg had been suffering for years, was 
definitely broken. 


With typical Marxist and Jewish mendacity, an attempt was made by the 
distribution of leaflets to passers-by in the street to incite the ‘comrades of the 
International Proletariat’ to demonstrate, once more in the public streets. 


Completely distorting the facts, they declared that our ‘bands of 
assassins’ had commenced ‘a war of extermination against the peaceful 
workers of Coburg.’ 


At half-past one that day there was to be a ‘great popular demonstration,’ 
at which it was hoped that thousands of workers from the whole district would 
turn up. 


I was determined finally to crush this Red Terror and so I summoned the 
Storm Detachment to meet at midday. 


Their number had now increased to fifteen hundred. I decided to march 
with these men to the Coburg citadel and to cross the big square where the Red 
demonstration was to take place. 


618 


I wanted to see if they would attempt to assault us again. When we 
entered the square we found that, instead of the thousands that had been 
advertised, there were only a few hundred people present. 


As we approached, they remained silent for the most part, and some ran 
away. Only at certain points along the route some bodies, of Reds, who had 
arrived from outside the city and had not yet come to know us, attempted to 
start a row, but they were soon put to flight. 


We could now observe how the town’s people, who had for such a long 
time been so thoroughly intimidated, slowly woke up and recovered their 
courage. 


They welcomed us openly, and in the evening, on our return march, 
spontaneous cheering broke out at several points along the route. 


At the station the railway officials informed us all of a sudden that our 
train would not depart. Thereupon I had some of the ringleaders told that if this 
were the case I would arrest all the Red Party heroes on whom we could lay 
our hands, that we would drive the train ourselves, but that we would take 
away with us, in the locomotive, on the tender and in every carriage, a few 
dozen disciples of international solidarity. 


I did not omit to let these gentry know that if we had to drive the train, 
the journey would undoubtedly be a very risky adventure and that we might all 
break our necks. 


It would be a consolation, however, to know that we should not go to 
Eternity alone, but in equality and fraternity with the Red gentry. 


Thereupon the train departed punctually and we arrived next morning 
safe and sound in Munich. 


Thus at Coburg, for the first time since 1914, the equality of all citizens 
was re-established in the eye of the law, for even if some coxcomb of a higher 
official should presume to assert to-day that the State protects the lives of its 
citizens, in those days at least it was not so. At that time the citizens had to 
defend themselves against the representatives of the present State. 


At first it was not possible fully to estimate the importance of the 
consequences of that day. The victorious Storm Troops had their confidence in 
themselves considerably reinforced and also their faith in the sagacity of their 


619 


leaders. 


Our contemporaries began to pay us special attention and for the first 
time many recognised in the National Socialist Movement an institution which 
was in all probability destined to bring the Marxist folly to an end. Only the 
democrats lamented the fact that we had not had the complaisance to allow our 
skulls to be cracked and that, in a democratic Republic, we had dared to reply 
to a brutal assault with fisticuffs and cudgels rather than with pacifist chants. 


The bourgeois press as a whole adopted, as usual, an attitude that was 
partly lachrymose and partly mean. Only a few decent newspapers expressed 
their satisfaction that in one locality at least, the Marxist street-bullies had 
been effectively dealt with. 


In Coburg itself, at least a section of the Marxist workers who must be 
looked upon as misled, learned from the blows of National Socialist fists that 
they too, were workers fighting for ideals, because experience teaches that the 
human being fights only for something in which he believes and which he 
loves. 


The Storm Detachment itself benefited most from the Coburg expedition. 
It grew so quickly in numbers that at the Party Congress in January 1923, six 
thousand men participated in the ceremony of consecrating the flags and the 
first companies appeared for the first time in the glory of their new uniform. 


Our experience at Coburg proved how essential it was to introduce one 
distinctive uniform for the Storm Detachment, not only for the purpose of 
strengthening its esprit de corps, but also to avoid confusion and the danger of 
not recognising the opponent in a fight. Up to that time they had merely been 
distinguished by the armlet, but now the tunic and the well-known cap were 
added. 


The experience gained at Coburg had also another important result. We 
now determined to break the Red Terror in all those localities in which it had 
for many years prevented men of other views from holding meetings. 


We were determined to restore the right of free assembly. From that time 
onward we brought our battalions together in such places and little by little the 
Red citadels of Bavaria fell one after another before tie National Socialist 
propaganda. 


The Storm Troops became more and more adept at their task. Gradually, 


620 


they placed an increasingly wide gulf between themselves and the aimless 
defence movements and established themselves as an active militant 
organisation, fighting for the establishment of a new German State. 


This logical development continued until March 1923. Then an event 
occurred which made me divert the Movement from the course hitherto 
followed and introduce certain fundamental formations. 


The third event was that in the first months of 1923 the French occupied 
the Ruhr district. The consequence of this was of great importance in the 
development of the Storm Detachment. 


It is no yet possible, nor would it be in the interests of the nation, to 
write or speak openly and freely on the subject. I shall speak of it only in so far 
as the matter has been dealt with in public discussions and thus brought to the 
knowledge of everybody. The occupation of the Ruhr district, which did not 
come as a Surprise to us, gave grounds for hoping that Germany would at last 
abandon her cowardly policy of submission and thereby give the defence 
leagues a definite task to fulfil. 


The Storm Detachment, which now numbered several thousand vigorous 
young men, would also have participated in this national service. 


During the spring and summer of 1923 it was transformed into a fighting 
military organisation. It is to this reorganisation that we must in great part 
attribute the later developments that took place during 1923, in so far as these 
affected our Movement. 


Elsewhere I shall deal in broad outline with the events of 1923. Here I 
wish only to state that the transformation of the Storm Detachment at that time 
was detrimental to the interests of the Movement, since the condition (namely, 
the adoption of a policy of active resistance against France) which had led to 
the change, was never realised. 


The events which took place at the close of 1923, terrible as they may 
appear at first sight, were almost a necessity if looked at from a higher 
standpoint; because in view of the attitude taken by the Government of the 
German Reich, the conversion of the Storm Troops into a military force 
became meaningless and thus a transformation which would have proved 
harmful to the Movement was stopped forthwith. 


Thereby it was made possible for us to set about the task of 


621 


reconstruction at the point at which we had been diverted from our proper 
course. 


In the year 1925 the National Socialist German Labour Party was re- 
founded and had to organise and train its Storm Detachment once again 
according to the principles I had laid down. 


It must revert, to its original sound views and must once more consider 
as its most essential function the establishment of its Storm Detachments as an 
instrument of defence and strength in the Movement’s struggle to establish its 
Weltanschauung and once more it must consider it as its most essential task to 
function as the instrument of defence and reinforcement in the spiritual struggle 
to establish the ideals of the Movement. 


The Storm Detachment must not be allowed to sink to the level of 
something in the nature of a defence league or a secret society. Steps must 
rather be taken to make it a force one hundred thousand strong to act as 
champion of the National Socialist, and thus of the genuinely volkisch ideal.

624 


CHAPTER X: THE MASK OF FEDERALISM 


In the winter of 1919, and still more in the spring and summer of 1920, 
the young Party felt bound to take up a definite stand on a question which had 
already become serious during the War. 


In the first volume of this book I have briefly recorded certain facts 
which I had personally witnessed, and which foreboded the break-up of 
Germany. 


In describing these facts I made reference to the special nature of the 
Propaganda which was directed by the English as well as by the French 
towards reopening the breach that had existed between North and South in 
Germany. 


In the spring of 1915 there appeared the first of a series of leaflets, the 
aim of which was to arouse feeling against Prussia as being solely responsible 
for the War. 


By 1916 this kind of propaganda had been developed and perfected ina 
mariner that was as cunning as it was poisonous. 


Appealing to the basest of human instincts, this propaganda endeavoured 
to arouse the wrath of the South Germans against the North Germans and after a 
short time it bore fruit. 


Persons who were then in high positions in the Government and in the 
Army, especially those attached to the headquarters of the Bavarian divisions, 
merited the just reproof of having blindly neglected their duty and failed to take 
the necessary definite steps to counter such propaganda, but nothing was done. 


On the contrary, it did not appear to be wholly unwelcome in some 
quarters and probably they were short-sighted enough to think that such 
propaganda would not only put an end to the movement towards unification in 
Germany, but that it might even automatically serve to strengthen the federative 
States. 


Scarcely ever in the course of history has such wicked neglect called 
down a more severe retribution. 


The weakening of Prussia, which, it was hoped, would result from this 


625 


propaganda, affected the whole of Germany. It served to hasten the collapse 
which not only wrecked Germany as a whole, but primarily the federal states. 
The Revolution first broke out in the city in which the artificially created 
hatred against Prussia raged most violently and, as elsewhere, it took the form 
of revolt against the reigning House. It would be a mistake to think that the 
enemy propaganda was exclusively responsible for creating an anti-Prussian 
feeling and that there was no excuse for the people for having listened to this 
propaganda. 


The incredible fashion in which our national economy was administered 
during the War through an absolutely crazy system of centralisation by means of 
which the whole Reich territory was brought under its control and exploited, 
furnished the principal grounds for the growth of anti-Prussian feeling. 


The average citizen looked upon the companies formed for the collection 
and distribution of war-time supplies, all of which had their headquarters in 
Berlin, as identical with Berlin, and Berlin itself as identical with Prussia. 


The average citizen did not realise that the organisation of these robber 
companies, which were called war-companies, was not in the hands of either 
Berlin or Prussia or even in German hands at all. 


People recognised only the gross irregularities and the continual 
encroachments perpetrated by that hated institution in the metropolis of the 
Reich and directed their anger against Berlin and Prussia, all the more because 
in certain quarters nothing was done to correct this attitude, but it was even 
welcomed with silent satisfaction. 


The Jew was far too shrewd not to understand that the infamous 
campaign which he had organised, under the disguise of war-companies, for 
plundering the German nation must eventually arouse opposition. 


As long as that opposition was not directed against himself he had no 
reason to be afraid. Hence he decided that the best way of forestalling an 
outbreak of hatred against himself on the part of the enraged and desperate 
masses was to direct their wrath against someone else and thus to allow it to 
burn itself out. 


Let Bavaria quarrel as much as it liked with Prussia and Prussia with 
Bavaria! The more bitter the strife between the two states, the greater the 
security of the Jew. 


626 


Thus public attention was completely diverted from the international 
maggot in the body of the nation; indeed it seemed to have been forgotten. 


Then when there appeared to be a danger that level-headed people, of 
whom there were many even in Bavaria, called for reflection and the exercise 
of restraint, thus calming the rage against Prussia, so that the bitter struggle 
threatened to peter out, all the Jew in Berlin had to do was to stage a fresh 
provocation and await results. 


Immediately all those profiting by the conflict between North and South 
hailed such an incident with delight and again fanned the flame of indignation 
until it became a blaze. It was a shrewd and expert manoeuvre on the part of 
the Jew, to set the different branches of the German people quarrelling among 
themselves, so that their attention was turned away from himself and he could 
exploit them all the more completely. 


Then came the Revolution. Until the year 1918, or rather until the 
November of that year, the average German citizen, particularly the less 
educated lower middle classes and the workers, did not rightly understand 
what was happening and did not realise what must be the inevitable 
consequences, especially for Bavaria, of this internecine strife between the 
various branches of the German people. 


Those sections of the people who called themselves ‘national’ ought to 
have clearly perceived these consequences on the day on which the Revolution 
broke out, for the moment the coup d’etat had succeeded, the leader and 
organiser of the Revolution came forward in Bavaria as the defender of 
‘Bavarian’ interests. 


The international Jew Kurt Eisner, began to play off Bavaria against 
Prussia. This Oriental was the last person in the world fitted to defend the 
interests of Bavaria, since in following his profession as a newspaper reporter, 
he had wandered from place to place all over Germany, and of all the world, 
Bavaria was the place which interested him least. 


In deliberately giving the revolutionary rising in Bavaria the character of 
an offensive against the rest of the Reich, Kurt Eisner was not by any means 
acting from the standpoint of Bavarian interests, but merely as the authorised 
representative of Jewry. 


He exploited existing instincts and antipathies in Bavaria as a means of 


627 


facilitating the dismemberment of Germany. Once dismembered, the Reich 
would fall an easy prey to Bolshevism. 


The tactics employed by him were continued for a time after his death. 
The Marxists, who had always derided the individual German states and their 
princes, now suddenly appealed, as an “Independent Party’, to those sentiments 
and instincts which had their strongest roots in the houses of the reigning 
princes and in the individual states. 


The fight waged by the Bavarian Soviet Republic against the military 
contingents that were sent to free Bavaria from its grasp was represented by 
the Marxist propagandists as being primarily the Bavarian workers’ struggle’ 
against ‘Prussian militarism.’ 


This explains why it was that the Soviet Republic in Munich did not 
have the same effect there as in the other German districts. Instead of recalling 
the masses to a sense of reason, it led to increased bitterness and anger against 
Prussia. 


The art of the Bolshevist agitators, in representing the suppression of the 
Bavarian Soviet Republic as a victory of ‘Prussian militarism’ over the ‘anti- 
militarist’ and ‘anti-Prussian’ people of Bavaria, bore rich fruit. Whereas at the 
elections for the Bavarian Legislative Diet in Munich, Kurt Eisner did not have 
ten thousand followers and the Communist Party less than three thousand, after 
the fall of the Bavarian Republic, the two parties together could reckon on 
nearly one hundred thousand voting in their favour. 


It was at this time that I began my own struggle against the folly of 
inciting one branch of the German people against the other. I believe that never 
in my life did I undertake a more unpopular task than I did when I took my 
stand against the anti-Prussian agitation. 


During the Soviet regime in Munich great public meetings were held at 
which hatred against the rest of Germany, but particularly against Prussia, was 
roused to such a pitch that a North German would have risked his life in 
attending one of those meetings. 


These meetings often ended in wild shouts of ‘Away from Prussia,’ 
Down with Prussia,’ ‘War against Prussia,’ and so on. 


This feeling was openly expressed in the Reichstag by a particularly 
brilliant defender of Bavarian sovereign rights, when he said: ‘Rather let us 


628 


die Bavarians than rot as Prussians.’ 


Only those who attended some of the meetings held at that time can 
realise what it implied for me personally, when, for the first time and 
surrounded by only a handful of friends, I raised my voice against this folly at a 
meeting held in the Miinchener Lowenbrau-Keller. 


My war comrades stood by me then. It is easy to imagine how we felt 
when we were howled at and threatened by a raging crowd, which was beyond 
all control and composed of men who, while we had been defending our 
country, had for the most part been deserters and shirkers skulking in billets 
behind the lines or at home. 


It is true that such episodes turned out to be of advantage to me. My 
small band of comrades felt for the first time absolutely united with me and 
readily swore to stand by me to the death. 


These clashes, which were constantly repeated throughout the year 1919, 
seemed to become more violent soon after the beginning of 1921. 


There were meetings I remember especially one in the Wagnersaal in the 
Sonnenstrasse in Munich, during the course of which my group, now grown 
much larger, had to defend itself against assaults of the most violent character. 


It happened more than once that dozens of my followers were 
manhandled, thrown to the floor and stamped upon by the attackers and were 
finally thrown out of the hall more dead than alive. 


The struggle upon which I had embarked, first on my own, and supported 
only by my war-comrades, was now continued by the young Movement, I might 
say almost as a sacred mission. 


I am proud of being able to say to-day that we-depending almost 
exclusively on our followers in Bavaria-were responsible for putting an end, 
slowly but surely, to the coalition of folly and treason. I say ‘folly and treason’ 
because, although convinced that the masses who joined in it meant well but 
were stupid, I cannot consider such simplicity as an extenuating circumstance 
in the case of the organisers and their abettors. 


I looked upon them then, and still look upon them to-day, as traitors in 
the pay of France. In one case, that of Dorten, history has already pronounced 
judgment. 


629 


The situation became specially dangerous at that time by reason of the 
fact that they were very astute in their ability to cloak their real tendencies, by 
insisting primarily on their federative intentions and claiming that these were 
the sole motives for their actions. 


Of course, it is quite obvious that the agitation against Prussia had 
nothing to do with federalism. 


Surely ‘federal activities’ is not the phrase with which to describe an 
effort to dissolve and dismember another federal state, for an honest federalist 
(in whom it is not hypocrisy to quote the formula used by Bismarck to define 
his idea of the Reich) could not in the same breath express the desire to cut off 
portions of the Prussian State, which was created or at least completed by 
Bismarck, nor could he publicly support such a separatist attempt. 


What an outcry would have been raised 1n Munich if some Prussian 
conservative party had declared itself in favour of detaching Franconia from 
Bavaria, or had publicly demanded or taken steps to promote such a separatist 
policy. 


Nevertheless, one cannot but feel sympathy for the genuine federalists 
who did not see through this infamous swindle, for they were its principal 
victims. 

By distorting the federalist idea in such a way, its own champions 
prepared its grave. One cannot make propaganda for a federal form of 
government within the Reich by debasing, abusing and besmirching the 
essential element of such a political structure, namely Prussia, and thus making 
such a state impossible as a member of the federation. 


It is all the more, incredible by reason of the fact that the fight carried on 
by those so-called federalists was directed against that section of the Prussian 
people which was the last that could be regarded as being connected with the 
November democracy. 


For the abuse and attacks of these so-called federalists were not levelled 
against the authors of the Weimar Constitution—the majority of whom were 
South Germans or Jews—but against those who represented the old 
conservative Prussia, which was the antithesis of the Weimar Constitution. 


The fact that those who directed this campaign were careful not to touch 
the Jews is not to be wondered at and perhaps gives the key to the whole 


630 


riddle. 


Before the Revolution, the Jew was successful in distracting attention 
from himself and his war-companies by inciting the masses, and especially the 
Bavarians, against Prussia; similarly, he felt obliged, after the Revolution, to 
find some way of camouflaging his new marauding campaign, the scope of 
which had increased tenfold. 


Again he succeeded, in this case by provoking the so-called ‘national’ 
elements in Germany against one another—the conservative Bavarians against 
the Prussians, who were just as conservative. 


He acted again with extreme cunning, inasmuch as he, who held the 
destiny of Germany in his hands, was behind acts of provocation so crude and 
tactless that the victims became incensed again and again—never against the 
Jew, but always against their own fellow-Germans. 


The Bavarian did not see the Berlin of four million industrious and 
efficient working people, but only the lazy and decadent Berlin which haunts 
the worst quarters of the West End, and yet antipathy was not directed against 
the West End of Berlin but against the ‘Prussian’ city. I was often driven to 
despair. 


The ability which the Jew displays in turning public attention away from 
himself and directing it elsewhere can be observed at the present time. 


In 1918 there was nothing like an organised anti-Semitic feeling. I still 
remember the difficulties we encountered the moment we mentioned the word 
Jew. We were either confronted with dumb-struck faces or else met with lively 
antagonism. 


The efforts we made at the time to point out to the public its real enemy 
seemed to be doomed to failure, but then things began to change for the better, 
though only very slowly. 


The Schutz and Trutzbund (Watch and Ward League) was defectively 
organised, but at least it had the great merit of opening up the Jewish question 
once again. 


In the winter of 1918-1919 a kind of anti-Semitism slowly began to take 
root. Later on, the National Socialist Movement presented the Jewish problem 
in a new light. 


631 


Taking the question beyond the restricted circles of the upper classes and 
small bourgeoisie we succeeded in transforming it into the vital motive of a 
great popular movement, but the moment we were successful in placing this 
problem before the German people in the light of an idea that would unite them 
in one struggle, the Jew reacted. 


He resorted to his old tactics. With amazing alacrity lie, sowed the seeds 
of discord within the vol/kisch movement itself and started a rift there. 


The raising of the ultramontane question and the resulting quarrels 
between Catholic and Protestant presented, under the conditions then 
prevailing, the only possibility of diverting public attention to other matters 
and staving off a concentrated attack upon the Jews. The men who dragged our 
people into this controversy can never make amends for the crime they then 
committed against the nation. 


Anyhow, the Jew has attained his ends. Catholics and Protestants are 
fighting one another to their heart’s content, while the enemy of Aryan humanity 
and of all Christendom is laughing up his sleeve. 


Just as it was once possible to occupy the attention of the public for 
several years with the struggle between federalism and unification, wearing 
out its energy in this mutual friction, while the Jew trafficked in the freedom of 
the nation and sold our country to the masters of international high finance—so 
in our day he has succeeded again, this time by raising strife between the two 
German religious denominations, while the foundations on which both rest are 
being eaten away and destroyed through the poison injected by international 
and cosmopolitan Jewry. 


Look at the injuries which our people are suffering daily as a result of 
being contaminated with Jewish blood. Bear in mind the fact that this 
poisonous contamination can be eliminated from the national body only after 
the lapse of centuries, if ever. 


Think further of how the process of racial degeneration is debasing and 
in some cases even destroying the fundamental Aryan qualities of our German 
people, so that our cultural creative ability as a nation is gradually decreasing 
and we are running the danger, at least in our great cities, of sinking to the level 
on which Southern Italy is to-day. 


This pestilential adulteration of the blood, of which hundreds of 


632 


thousands of our people take no account, is being systematically practised by 
the Jew to-day. Systematically these Swarthy parasites within our national 
body corrupt our innocent fair-haired girls and thus destroy something which 
can never be replaced in this world. 


The two Christian denominations look on with indifference at the 
profanation and destruction of a noble and unique creature who was given to 
the world as a gift of God’s grace. 


As regards the future of the world, it does not matter which of the two 
triumphs, the Catholic or the Protestant faith, but it does matter whether Aryan 
humanity survives or perishes. 


Yet the two Christian denominations are not contending against the 
destroyer of Aryan humanity, but are trying to destroy one another. 


It is the sacred duty, particularly of those who adopt a patriotic attitude, 
to see to it that within the framework of their own particular denomination, 
they do not render mere lip-service to God, but actually fulfil the Will of God 
and do not allow His handiwork to be debarred, for it was by the Will of God 
that man was created ina certain image and endowed with certain 
characteristics and certain faculties. 


Whoever destroys His work, wages war against God’s creation and 
God’s will. Therefore, everyone should endeavour, each in his own 
denomination, of course, and should consider it as his first and most solemn 
duty, to hinder any and every one whose conduct tends, either by word or deed, 
to overstep the limits of his own religious community and to raise a quarrel 
with those of another denomination. 


For, in view of the religious schism that exists in Germany, to attack the 
essential characteristics of one denomination must necessarily lead to a war of 
extermination between the two Christian denominations. 


There can be no comparison between our position and that of France, 
Spain or Italy. In those three countries one may, for instance, make propaganda 
for the side that is fighting against clericalism or ultramontanism, without 
thereby incurring the danger of a national rift among the French, Spanish or 
Italian people. 


In Germany, however, that cannot be done, for here the Protestants would 
also take part in such a movement and thus the defence, which elsewhere only 


633 


Catholics organise against clerical interference by their own prelates in 
political matters, would assume with us the character of a Protestant attack 
against Catholicism. 


What may be tolerated by the faithful belonging to one denomination 
even when it seems unjust to them, will at once be indignantly rejected and 
opposed on a priori grounds if it should come from the militant leaders of 
another denomination. 


This is so true that even men who might be ready and willing to fight for 
the removal of manifest grievances within their own religious denomination 
will drop their own fight and turn their activities against the outsider, the 
moment the abolition of such grievances is counselled or demanded by one 
who 1s not of the same faith. 


They consider it unjustifiable, inadmissible and incorrect for outsiders to 
meddle in matters which do not concern them. Such attempts are not excusable 
even when they are inspired by a feeling for the supreme interests of the 
national community, because even in our day religious sentiment still has 
deeper roots than all feeling for political and national expediency. 


This cannot be changed by setting one denomination against another in 
bitter conflict. It can be changed only if, through a spirit of mutual tolerance, 
the nation can be assured of a future, the greatness of which will gradually 
operate as a conciliating factor in the sphere of religion also. 


I have no hesitation in saying with regard to those men who to-day seek 
to embroil the vo/Aisch movement in religious quarrels, that they are worse 
enemies of my country than any internationally-minded Communist. 


The National Socialist Movement has set itself the task of converting 
those Communists, but anyone who goes outside the ranks of his own 
movement and tends to divert it from the fulfilment of its mission, is acting ina 
manner that deserves the severest condemnation. He is acting as a champion of 
Jewish interests, whether consciously or unconsciously does not matter, for it 
is to the interest of the Jews to-day that the energies of the volkisch movement 
should be frittered away in a religious conflict, because it is beginning to be 
dangerous for the Jews. 


I have purposely used the phrase about ‘frittering away’ the energies of 
the movement, because no one but he who is entirely ignorant of history could 


634 


imagine that this movement can to-day solve a question which the greatest 
statesmen have tried for centuries to solve, and tried in vain. 


Anyhow, the facts speak for themselves. The men who suddenly 
discovered in 1924, that the highest mission of the vo/kisch movement was to 
fight ultramontanism, have not succeeded in smashing it, but they did succeed 
in splitting the volkisch movement. 


I have to guard against some immature brain in the vo/kisch movement 
thinking that it can accomplish what even a Bismarck failed to do. 


It will always be one of the first duties of those who are directing the 
National Socialist Movement to oppose unconditionally any attempt to place 
the National Socialist Movement at the service of such a conflict. 


Anybody who conducts propaganda with that end in view must be 
expelled forthwith from its ranks. 


As a matter of fact, we succeeded until the autumn of 1923 in keeping 
our Movement aloof from such controversies. The most devout Protestant 
could stand side by side with the most devout Catholic in our ranks, secure in 
the knowledge that his religious convictions would be respected. 


The bitter struggle which both waged in common against the wrecker of 
Aryan civilisation taught them mutual respect and esteem; and it was, 
moreover, just at that time that our Movement had to engage in a bitter strife 
with the Centre Party not on religious grounds, but on national, racial, political 
and economic issues. 


The success we then achieved showed that we were right, and it speaks 
against those who to-day think they know better. 


In recent years things have gone so far that volkisch circles, in the god- 
forsaken blindness of their religious strife, could not recognise the folly of 
their conduct even in the light of the fact that atheist Marxist newspapers 
advocated the cause of one religious denomination or the other, according as it 
suited them—so as to inculpate now the one party and now the other by the 
repetition of remarks which were often incredibly foolish, thus fanning the fire 
to keep the blaze at its highest. 


To a people like the Germans, whose history, has so often shown them 
capable of fighting for phantoms to the point of complete exhaustion, every 


635 


slogan of this kind is a mortal danger. 


By these slogans the attention of our people has too often been diverted 
from the real problems affecting their very existence. 


While we were exhausting our energies in religious wars, other 
countries were acquiring their share of the world, and while the volkisch 
movement is debating with itself whether the ultramontane danger be greater 
than the Jewish, or vice versa, the Jew is destroying the racial basis of our 
existence and thereby annihilating our people. 


As regards that kind of vélkisch champion, I pray with all my heart on 
behalf of the National Socialist Movement and therefore of the German people, 
‘Lord, preserve us from such friends, that we can more easily deal with our 
enemies.’ 


The controversy over federation and unification, so cunningly 
propagated by the Jews in 1919-1920 and thereafter, forced National 
Socialism, which repudiated the quarrel, to take up a definite attitude in 
relation to the essential problems bound up with it. 


Ought Germany to be a federated or a united State? 
What is the practical significance of these terms? 


To me it seems that the second question is more important than the first, 
because it is fundamental to the understanding of the whole problem and also 
because the answer to it may help to clear up confusion and therefore have a 
conciliating effect. 


What is a federation of states? By a federation of states we mean a union 
of sovereign states which, of their own free will, and by virtue of their 
sovereignty come together and create a collective unit, ceding to that unit as 
much of their own sovereign rights as will render the existence of the union 
possible and will guarantee it. 


The theoretical formula is not put wholly into practice by any federation 
of states that exists to-day, least of all by the American Union, where it is 
impossible to speak of original sovereignty in regard to the majority of the 
States. 


Many of them were not included in the federal complex until long after it 


636 


had been established. The states that make up the American Union are mostly 
in the nature of greater or smaller territories, limited for technical 
administrative purposes, their boundaries having in many cases been fixed in 
the mapping office. 


Originally, these states did not and could not possess sovereign rights of 
their own, since they did not combine to form the Union, but it was, on the 
contrary, the Union which created a number of these so-called states. 


Therefore the sovereign rights, often very comprehensive, which were 
left, or rather granted, to the various territories, correspond not only to the 
whole character of the Confederation, but also to its vast area, which is almost 
equivalent to the size of a continent. 


Consequently, in speaking of the United States of America one must not 
consider them as sovereign states, but as states enjoying certain rights, or 
perhaps one ought to say powers, which have been granted to them and 
guaranteed under the constitution. 


Nor does our definition adequately express the condition of affairs in 
Germany, although it is true that in Germany the individual states existed as 
states before the Reich and that the Reich was formed from them. 


The Reich, however, was not formed by the voluntary and equal co- 
operation of the individual states, but rather because the state of Prussia 
gradually acquired a position of hegemony over the others. 


The difference in territorial area alone precludes any comparison 
between the German states and the American Union. 


The great difference in territorial area between the very small German 
states which then existed and the larger, and, ina still more pronounced 
degree, the largest, demonstrates the inequality of their achievements and 
shows that they could not have played an equal part in founding the Reich and 
in shaping the federal Empire. 


In the case of most of these individual states it cannot be maintained that 
they ever enjoyed real sovereignty, unless we choose to regard the phrase 
‘sovereign state’ as being merely an official designation. 


As a matter of fact, not only developments in the past, but also in our 
own time wiped out several of these so-called ‘sovereign states’ and thus 


637 


proved in the most definite way how frail these structures were. 


I cannot deal here with the historical question of how these individual 
states came to be established, but I must call attention to the fact that hardly in 
any case did their frontiers coincide with the ancestral tribal frontiers of their 
inhabitants. They were purely political phenomena which for the most part 
emerged during the darkest period in the history of the German Empire and 
they represented both cause and effect in that, process of exhaustion and 
partition of our Fatherland. 


The constitution of the old Reich took all this into account, at least to a 
certain degree, in so far as the individual states were not accorded equal 
representation in the Federal Council, but a representation proportionate to 
their respective areas, their actual importance and the role which they played 
in the formation of the Reich. 


Only in very few cases can it be asserted that the sovereign rights which 
the individual states renounced in order to render possible the foundation of 
the Reich were ceded voluntarily, since, for the most part, they did not exist in 
reality. In other instances they were simply done away with under the pressure 
exerted by the more powerful Prussia. 


The principle followed by Bismarck was not, to give to the Reich what 
he could take from the individual states, but to demand from the individual 
states only what was absolutely necessary for the Reich. A moderate and wise 
policy! 


On the one, hand, Bismarck showed the greatest regard for customs and 
traditions; on the other hand his policy secured for the new Reich, from its 
foundation onwards, a great measure of love and willing co-operation. 


It would, however, be a fundamental error to attribute Bismarck’s 
decision to any conviction on his part that the Reich had thus acquired such 
rights of sovereignty as would suffice for all time. That was far from being 
Bismarck’s idea. 


On the contrary, he wished to leave it to the future to settle what would 
be difficult to carry through at the moment and might not have been readily 
agreed to by the individual states. He trusted to the levelling effect of time and 
to the pressure exercised by the process of evolution, the steady action of 
which appeared to him more effective than an attempt to break the resistance 


638 


which the individual states offered at the moment. 


By adopting this policy, he showed his mastery of the art of 
statesmanship. As a matter of fact, the sovereignty of the Reich has continually 
increased at the cost of the sovereignty of the individual states. 


The passing of time has achieved what Bismarck hoped it would. The 
German collapse and the abolition of the monarchical form of government 
necessarily hastened this development. 


The German federal states, which had not been grounded on ethnological 
foundations, but arose rather out of political conditions, were bound to lose 
their importance the moment the monarchical form of government and the 
dynasties connected with it were abolished. For it was to the spirit inherent in 
these that the individual states owed their political origin and development. 


Thus deprived of their internal raison d’étre, many of these petty states 
renounced all right to survival and were induced for purely practical reasons 
to fuse with their neighbours, or else they joined the more powerful states of 
their own free will. 


This proved ina striking manner low extraordinarily frail was the actual 
sovereignty these small states enjoyed, and it proved too, how lightly they 
were esteemed by their own citizens. 


Though the abolition of the monarchical regime and its representatives 
had dealt the federal character of the Reich a hard blow, still more destructive, 
from the federal point of view, was the acceptance of the obligations that 
resulted from the ‘peace’ treaty. 


It was only natural and logical that the federal states should lose all 
sovereign control over their finances, the moment the Reich, in consequence of 
a lost war, was subjected to financial obligations which could never have been 
met by means of individual agreements concluded with the individual states. 


The subsequent steps which led the Reich to take over the postal 
services and railways were the inevitable result of the enslavement of our 
people which had begun with the peace treaties. 


The Reich was forced to obtain sole possession of more and more 
resources, in order to be in a position to meet the obligations resulting from 
increased extortion. 


639 


The form in which the powers of the Reich were thus extended to 
embrace the federal states was often ridiculously stupid, but in itself the 
procedure was logical and natural. 


The blame for this must be laid at the door of those men and those parties 
that failed in the hour of need to concentrate all their energies in an effort to 
bring the War to a victorious issue. 


The guilt lies with those parties which, especially in Bavaria, catered 
for their own egotistic interests during the War, and refused to the Reich what 
the Reich had to requisition in a tenfold greater measure when the War was 
lost. The retribution of history! 


Rarely has the vengeance of Heaven followed so closely on the crime, as 
it did in this case. Those same parties which, a few years previously, placed 
the interests of their own states—especially in Bavaria—before those of the 
Reich, had now to look on passively while the pressure of events forced the 
Reich, in its own interests, to abolish the existence of the individual states. 
They were the victims of their own defaults. 


It is an unparalleled act of hypocrisy to complain to the electorate (for it 
is only to the electorate that our contemporary parties address their 
propaganda) of the loss suffered by the individual states in being deprived of 
certain of their sovereign powers, while, at the same time, these selfsame 
parties vied with each other in pursuing a policy of favouring the fulfilment of 
the Versailles obligations—a policy of which the final outcome will be a 
profound alteration in the internal structure of the Reich. 


Bismarck’s Reich was free and unhampered by any obligations towards 
the outside world. Bismarck’s Reich never had to shoulder such heavy and 
entirely unproductive obligations as those imposed on Germany under the 
Dawes Plan. 


Even at home the authority of Bismarck’s Reich was confined to dealing 
with only a few absolutely essential matters. It was, therefore, possible for the 
Reich to dispense with the necessity for financial control over the federal 
states and to live on their contributions. 


It goes without saying that, on the one hand, the preservation of certain of 
their sovereign rights and, on the other, the relatively small financial tribute 
which the federal states had to pay to the Reich induced them to welcome its 


640 


existence. But it is untrue and unfair to state now, as certain propagandists do 
that the federal states were antagonistic to the Reich merely because of their 
financial subjection to it. That is not the true state of affairs. The lack of 
sympathy for the political idea embodied in the Reich is not due to the loss of 
sovereign rights on the part of the individual states. 


It is much more the result of the deplorable fashion in which the present 
regime acts as the representative of the German people. 


Despite all the celebrations in honour of the national flag and the 
constitution, the present Reich has failed to arouse the enthusiasm of any 
section of the people and the Law for the Protection of the Republic may 
prevent outrages against republican institutions, but 1t will not gain the 
devotion of one single German. 


The excessive care displayed by the Republic in attempting to protect 
itself against its own citizens by means of laws and sentences of imprisonment, 
constitutes the most damning and most humiliating criticism of all republican 
institutions as such. 


For yet another reason it is untrue to say, as certain parties do to-day, that 
the waning popularity of the Reich is due to its encroachment upon certain 
sovereign rights which the individual states had heretofore enjoyed. 


Supposing the Reich had not extended its authority over the individual 
states, there 1s no reason to believe that it would find more favour among those 
states, if the general obligations remained as heavy as they now are. 


On the contrary, if the individual states to-day had to pay contributions to 
the amount required by the Reich in order to fulfil the provisions of the dictates 
designed to reduce Germany to slavery, the hostility towards the Reich would 
be infinitely greater. 


For then not only would it prove difficult to collect the respective 
contributions due to the Reich from the federal states, but coercive methods 
would have to be employed in making the collections. 


The Republic, having accepted the peace treaties and having neither the 
courage nor the intention to break them, must reckon with the obligations which 
the peace treaties have imposed on it. 


The responsibility for this situation lies solely with those parties who 


641 


preach unceasingly to the patient electoral masses the necessity of maintaining 
the autonomy of the federal states, while at the same time they advocate and 
demand that the Reich should pursue a policy which must necessarily lead to 
the suppression of even the very last of those so-called ‘sovereign’ rights. 


I say ‘necessarily’ because the present Reich has no other possible 
means of bearing the burden of charges which an insane domestic and foreign 
policy have laid on it. 


The wedge is being driven ever deeper and every new debt which the 
Reich contracts, through the criminal way in which the interests of Germany 
are represented vis-a-vis foreign countries, necessitates the exertion of fresh 
and stronger pressure at home. This again entails the progressive abolition of 
all the sovereign rights of the individual states in order to prevent the germs of 
opposition from becoming active or even from coming into being. 


The chief characteristic difference between the policy of the present 
Reich and that of former times lies in this: The old Reich gave freedom to its 
people at home and showed itself strong towards the outside world, whereas 
the Republic shows itself weak towards the foreigner and oppresses its own 
citizens at home. 


In both cases one attitude determines the other. A vigorous national state 
does not need to make many laws for the interior, because of the affection and 
loyalty of its citizens. 


The international servile state can live only by coercing its citizens to 
render it the services it demands, and it is a piece of impudence for the present 
regime to speak of ‘free citizens.’ 


They existed only in the Germany that is gone. The present Republic is a 
colony of slaves at the beck and call of the foreigner. At best it has subjects, 
but not citizens. 


Hence it does not possess a national emblem, but only a trade mark, 
introduced and protected by official decrees and legislative measures. 


This symbol, which is the Gessler’s cap of German Democracy, will 
always remain alien to our people. 


The Republic having no sense of tradition or respect for past greatness, 
dragged the emblem of the past in the mire, but it will be surprised to discover 


642 


one day how superficial is the devotion of its subjects to their own emblems. 
The Republic has given itself the character of an intermezzo in German history. 


This State is bound to restrict the sovereign rights of the individual states 
more and more, not only for general reasons of a financial character, but also 
on principle, for by enforcing a policy of financial blackmail. In order to 
squeeze the last ounce of substance out of its people, it is forced also to 
deprive them of their last remaining rights, lest the general discontent may one 
day flare up into open rebellion. 


We National Socialists would reverse this formula and would adopt the 
following fundamental principle: A strong national Reich which in its foreign 
policy represents and protects the interests of its citizens in the highest 
possible degree can allow freedom to reign at home without trembling for the 
safety of the State. 


On the other hand, a strong national government can encroach to a 
considerable degree on the liberties of the individual subject as well as on the 
liberties of the constituent states without thereby weakening the ideal of the 
Reich; and it is justified in so doing, if in these particular acts and measures 
the individual citizen recognises a means of promoting the prestige of the 
nation as a whole. It is a fact that the tendency in every state throughout the 
world is towards uniformity, and Germany will prove no exception in this 
respect. 


Even to-day it is absurd to talk of the sovereignty of individual states 
because this has already become impossible on account of the ridiculously 
small size of so many of these states. 


In the sphere of commerce, as well as in that of administration, the 
importance of the individual states has been steadily decreasing. 


Modern means of communication and mechanical progress have 
gradually reduced distance and space. What was once a state is to-day only a 
province and the territory covered by a modern state had once the importance 
of a continent. 


The purely technical difficulties connected with the administration of a 
State like Germany are not greater than those connected with the government of 
a province like Brandenburg a hundred and twenty years ago. 


To-day it is easier to cover the distance from Munich to Berlin than it 


643 


was to cover the distance from Munich to Starnberg a hundred years ago. 
Thanks to modern means of transport, the whole territory of the Reich to-day is 
smaller than that of certain German federal states at the time of the Napoleonic 
wars. 


To close one’s eyes to the consequences of these facts is to live in the 
past. There always were, there are, and always will be, men who do this. They 
may retard, but they cannot stop the wheels of history. 


We National Socialists must not close our eyes to the logical 
consequences of these facts. Here again we must not permit ourselves to be 
misled by the hollow phrases of our so-called national bourgeois parties. 


I say ‘hollow phrases,’ because these same parties do not seriously 
believe that it is possible for them to carry out their proposals, and because 
they themselves are chiefly responsible for the present state of affairs. 


Especially in Bavaria, the demand for de-centralisation is no more than a 
party move behind which there is no serious resolve. 


Whenever these parties had to pass from the realm of phrase-making into 
that of practical deeds they failed miserably. On every occasion on which the 
Reich ‘robbed’ the Bavarian State ‘of sovereign rights,’ it met with no real 
resistance apart froma senseless and revolting outcry. 


Indeed, when anyone seriously opposed the madness that was shown in 
carrying out this system of centralisation he was condemned by those same 
parties as disloyal to the present State. 


They slandered, condemned and persecuted him until he was either shut 
up in prison or illegally deprived of the right of public speech. 


These facts should serve to convince our followers of the profound 
hypocrisy which characterizes these so-called federalist circles. To a certain 
extent they use the federalist doctrine just as they use religion-merely as a 
means of promoting their own base party interests. 


A certain uniformity, especially in the field of transport appears logical. 
But we National Socialists feel it our duty to oppose with all our might such a 
development in the modem State, especially when the measures proposed are 
solely for the purposes of screening and rendering possible a disastrous 
foreign policy. 


644 


Just because the present Reich has undertaken the nationalisation of the 
railways, the postal and telegraph services, the finances, etc., not from the 
elevated standpoint of national politics, but in order to have in its hands the 
means and security for the execution of a policy of unrestricted fulfilment of its 
pledges, we National Socialists must take every step that seems suitable to 
obstruct and, if possible, to prevent such a policy. 


We must fight against the present system of centralising institutions that 
are vitally important for the existence of our people, because this system is 
being adopted solely to facilitate the payment of milliards and the transference 
of pledges to the foreigner in accordance with our post-war foreign policy. For 
this reason the National Socialist Movement has to take up a stand against any 
such attempt. 


A second reason why we must oppose such centralisation is because in 
domestic affairs it helps to reinforce a system of government which in all its 
manifestations has brought the greatest misfortunes on the German nation. 


The present Jewish-Democratic Reich, which has become a veritable 
curse to the German people, is seeking to negate the force of the criticism 
offered by all the federal states which have not yet become imbued with the 
spirit of the age, and is trying to carry out this policy by reducing them to 
complete insignificance. 


We National Socialists, on the other hand, have every reason for 
attempting not only to establish the opposition of those individual states on the 
basis of a constitutional force which promises to be successful, but to make 
their struggle against centralisation as a whole the expression of higher 
national German interests in a wide sense. 


Therefore, while the Bavarian People’s Party, acting from its own 
narrow and particularist standpoint, fights to maintain the ‘special rights’ of the 
Bavarian state, we must utilise this particular attitude in the service of higher 
national interests which are at variance with those of the November 
Democracy. 


A third reason for opposing a centralising process of that kind arises 
from the certain conviction that to a great extent this so-called ‘Reichisation’ 
does not make for unification at all and still less for simplification. 


In many cases it is adopted simply as a means of removing from the 


645 


sovereign control of the individual states certain institutions and of placing 
these in the hands of the revolutionary parties. Never in, the course of German 
history has flagrant favouritism played so great a part as in the democratic 
republic. A great deal of this mania for centralisation is the work of those 
parties which once promised that they would open the way for the promotion 
of talent, intending thereby to fill posts and offices entirely with their own 
partisans. 


Since the foundation of the Republic the Jews especially have been 
obtaining positions in the economic institutions taken over by the Reich and 
also positions in the national administration, so that the one and the other have 
become the preserves of Jewry. 


For tactical reasons, this last consideration obliges us to watch with the 
greatest attention any further move in the direction of centralisation and fight it 
at every step. 


But in doing this our standpoint must always be that of a lofty national 
policy and never of pettifogging particularism. 


This last observation is necessary, lest the opinion might gain ground 
among our own followers that we do not accredit to the Reich the right of 
incorporating in itself a sovereignty which is superior to that of the constituent 
States. 


As regards this right we cannot, and must not, entertain the slightest 
doubt. Since for us the State is nothing but a vessel and its contents (that is to 
say, the nation, the people) the essential factor, it is clear that every other 
interest must be subordinated to the supreme interests of the nation. 


In particular, we cannot accredit to any other state a sovereign power 
and sovereign rights within the confines of the nation and the Reich, which 
represents the nation. 


The absurdity which some federal states commit by maintaining 
‘representatives’ abroad and among themselves must, and will, cease. 


Until this happens we cannot be surprised if certain foreign countries are 
dubious about the political unity of the Reich and act accordingly. 


The absurdity of these ‘representatives’ is all the greater because they do 
harm and do not yield the slightest advantage. If the interests of a German 


646 


abroad cannot be protected by the minister of the Reich, how much less can 
they be protected by the minister of some small federal state which appears 
ridiculous in the framework of the present world-order? 


The real truth is that these small federal states are envisaged as points of 
attack in connection with any attempt to bring about disintegration, engineered 
either from within or from without the German Reich, which attempts are 
always pleasing to a certain foreign State. 


We National Socialists must not allow some noble but degenerate family 
to obtain for one of its semi-moribund scions a ministerial post abroad with the 
idea that he might thrive in pastures new. 


Even in the days of the old Reich our diplomatic representatives abroad 
were such a sorry lot that further experiments of that kind are highly 
undesirable. It is certain that in the future the importance of the individual 
states will be transferred to the sphere of our cultural policy. 


Ludwig I, the monarch who did most to make Bavaria an important 
centre was not an obstinate particularist with anti-German tendencies, but was 
as much devoted to the ideal of a greater Germany as he was to art. 


His first consideration was to use the powers of the state to develop the 
cultural position of Bavaria and not its political power and in doing this he 
produced better and more durable results than if he had followed any other line 
of conduct. 


Up to this time Munich was a provincial capital of no great importance, 
but he transformed it into the metropolis of German art and by doing so he 
made it an intellectual centre which even to-day binds Franconia to Bavaria, 
though the Franconians are of quite a different temperament. 


If Munich had remained as it was formerly, what has happened in Saxony 
would have been repeated in Bavaria, with the difference that Nurnberg, the 
Bavarian counterpart of Leipzig, would have become, not a Bavarian, but a 
Franconian, city. 


It was not the cry of ‘Down with Prussia’ that made Munich great. What 
made this a city of importance was that the King wished to present it to the 
German nation as an artistic masterpiece that had to be seen to be appreciated, 
and it was both seen and appreciated. Therein lies a lesson for the future. 


647 


The importance of the individual states in the future will no longer lie in 
their political or constitutional power. 


I look on them rather as important Germanic ethnological and cultural 
political centres, but even here, time will perform its levelling work. Modem 
travelling facilities shuffle people together in such a way that tribal boundaries 
will fade out and even the cultural picture is gradually beginning to assume a 
more uniform pattern. 


The Army must definitely be kept clear of the influence of the individual 
states. The coming National Socialist State must not fall back into the error of 
the past by imposing on the Army a task which is not within its sphere and 
should never be assigned to it. 


The German Army is not meant to be a school for the preservation of 
provincial idiosyncrasies, but a school in which all Germans will learn to 
understand and adapt themselves to each other’s ways. 


Whatever tends to have a separating influence in the life of the nation 
ought to be made a unifying influence in the Army. 


The Army must raise the German boy above the narrow horizon of his 
own little native province and make him conscious that he is part of the nation. 


The youth must learn to know, not the confines of his own district, but 
those of his Fatherland, because it is the latter that he will have to defend one 
day. 


It is, therefore, absurd to have the German youth do his military training 
in his own native district. During that period he ought to learn to know 
Germany. This is all the more important to-day, since young Germans no longer 
travel during their years of apprenticeship as they once used to do, thus 
enlarging their horizon. 


In view of this, is it not absurd to leave the young Bavarian recruit in 
Munich, the Franconian in Nurnberg, the recruit from Baden in Karlsruhe, the 
Wurtemberger at Stuttgart and so on? 


Would it not be more sensible to show the Bavarian the Rhine and the 
North Sea, the native of Hamburg the Alps and the lad from East Prussia the 
mountains of Central Germany? 


648 


The character proper to each region ought to be maintained in the troops, 
but not in the barracks. We may disapprove of every attempt to achieve 
uniformity, but not as regards the Army. On the contrary, even if we were 
opposed to any such tendency, we would be bound to welcome it in this 
specific case, apart from the fact that, in view of the size of the present Army 
of the Reich, it would be absurd to maintain federal divisions. 


Moreover, we regard the uniformity which has been achieved in the 
Reich Army as something which we must retain even in future when we re- 
establish the national Army. 


Finally, a new and triumphant ideal should burst every chain which tends 
to paralyse its activity in promoting its ideas. 


National Socialism must claim the right to impose its principles on the 
whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of 
federal states. 


We must educate the German nation in our ideology and principles. As 
the Churches do not feel themselves bound or limited by political frontiers, so 
the National Socialist ideology cannot be confined to any of the federal states 
which constitute our Fatherland. 


The National Socialist doctrine is not meant to serve the political 
interests of the individual federal states, but to dominate the whole German 
nation. 


It must determine the life of the whole people and shape that life anew. 
For this reason we must imperatively demand the right to overstep boundaries 
that have been traced by a political development which we repudiate. 


The more complete the triumph of the National Socialist ideology, the 
greater will be the liberty which it can concede to the individual within the 
State.

651 


CHAPTER XI: PROPAGANDA AND 
ORGANISATION 


The year 1921 was, from many points of view, particularly important for 
me and for the National Socialist Movement. 


When I entered the German Labour Party, I at once took charge of the 
propaganda, believing this branch to be far the most important for the time 
being. 


The first necessity was not so much to rack one’s brains over problems 
connected with organisation as to spread out ideas among as many people as 
possible. 


Propaganda should go well ahead of organisation and gather together the 
human material for the latter to work up. I have never been in favour of hasty 
and pedantic methods of organisation, because, in most cases, the result is 
merely a piece of dead mechanism and rarely a living organisation. 


Organisation 1s a thing which derives its existence from organic life, 
organic evolution. When the same set of ideas have taken root in the minds ofa 
certain number of people they tend of themselves to achieve a certain degree of 
order among those people and this inner development is of inestimable value. 


Of course, here, as everywhere else, one must take account of those 
human weaknesses which make men hesitate, especially at the beginning, to 
submit to the control of a superior mind. 


AS soon as an organisation functions mechanically from above, there is 
always the danger that some individual who has been appointed to a certain 
office, but who has not yet proved his mettle and may be far from efficient, 
will, from motives of sheer jealousy, try to hinder abler persons from taking a 
leading place in the movement. 


The damage that results from that kind of thing may have fatal 
consequences, especially in a new movement. 


For this reason it is advisable first to propagate and publicly expound 
the ideas on which the movement is founded. This work of propaganda should 
continue for a certain time and should be directed from one centre. 


652 


When the ideas have gradually won over a number of people this human 
material should be carefully sifted for the purpose of selecting those who have, 
ability in leadership and of putting that ability to the test. 


It will often be found that apparently insignificant persons nevertheless 
turn out to be born leaders. 


At the same time it is quite wrong to imagine that possession of vast 
theoretical knowledge is a proof of capacity for leadership. The contrary is 
very frequently the case. 


Great theorists are only very rarely great organisers, because the 
greatness of the theorist and founder of a system coexists 1n being able to 
discover and lay down those laws that are right in the abstract, whereas the 
organiser must be first and foremost a psychologist. 


He must take men as they are, and for that reason he must know them, and 
have neither too high nor too low an estimate of human nature. 


He must take account of their weaknesses, their baseness and all their 
various characteristics, so as to form something which will be a living 
organism, endowed with great and unwavering force, fit to champion an ideal 
and pave the way for its successful realisation. 


It is still more rare to find a great theorist who is at the same time a great 
leader. An agitator is much more likely to prove a great leader a truth that is 
not palatable to many of those who deal with problems only from the scientific 
standpoint! 


Yet this is only natural, for an agitator who shows himself capable of 
expounding ideas to the great masses must always be a psychologist, even 
though he be only a demagogue. 


Therefore he will always be a much more capable leader than the 
contemplative theorist who, far from the madding crowd, meditates on his 
ideas. 


To be a leader means to be able to move the masses. The gift of 
formulating ideas has nothing whatsoever to do with the capacity for 
leadership. 


It would be entirely futile to discuss the question as to which is the more 


653 


important—the faculty for conceiving ideals and human aims or that of being 
able to realise them. Here, as so often in this world, the one would be entirely 
meaningless without the other. 


The noblest theoretical conceptions remain without purpose or value, if 
the leader cannot move the masses to accept them, and, conversely, what 
would it avail to have all the genius and verve of a leader if the intellectual 
theorist does not fix the aims for which mankind must struggle? 


But when the abilities of theorist, organiser and leader are united in the 
one person, then we have the rarest phenomenon on this earth, for it is that 
union which makes the great man. 


As I have already said, during my early days in the Party I devoted 
myself to the work of propaganda. I had to succeed in gradually gathering 
together a small nucleus of men who became imbued with the new doctrine, 
thus providing the human material which was subsequently to form the first 
elements of an organisation. Thus the goal of the propagandist was nearly 
always fixed far beyond that of the organiser. 


If a movement proposes to overthrow a certain order of things and set up 
a new one in its place, then the following principles must be clearly 
understood and respected by its leaders. 


Every movement which has gained its human material must first divide 
this material into two groups, namely, adherents and members. 


It is the task of the propagandist to gain adherents and it is the task of the 
organising body to enlist members. 


The adherent of a movement is he who sympathises with and accepts its 
aims, while the member is he who fights for them. 


The adherent is one for whom propaganda has converted to the doctrine 
of the movement. The member is he who will be charged by the organising 
body with collaborating in winning ever new adherents who will in turn 
become new members. 


Since to be an adherent demands only passive acceptance of an ideal, 
whereas membership implies championing and defending it, there will never 
be more than two members to every ten adherents. 


654 


Adhesion is based only on comprehension, whereas membership is 
founded on the courage to stand up for what has been comprehended and 
accepted and to propound it to others. 


The majority, being lazy and timid, is content with passive acceptance of 
a doctrine and only a minority will assume the responsibility of membership 
which implies readiness to defend one’s opinions. 


Such being the case, the propagandist must seek untiringly to acquire 
new followers for the movement, whereas the organising body must see to it 
that only the best elements among these followers are admitted to membership. 


The propagandist need not trouble about the personal worth of the 
individual converts he has won over to the movement. He need not inquire into 
their abilities, their intelligence or their character. 


From among these converts, however, the organising body will have to 
select those individuals who are most capable of actively helping to achieve 
victory for the movement. 


The propagandist aims at inducing the whole people to accept his 
teaching. The organising body includes within the framework of membership 
only those who, on psychological grounds, will not impede the further 
diffusion of the doctrines of the movement. 


The propagandist inculcates his doctrine upon the minds of the nation as 
a whole, preparing it for the time when this doctrine will triumph, whereas the 
organising body brings that triumph nearer by the continual, organic and 
combatant cohesion of those followers who have given proof of the necessary 
ability and will-power to carry on the struggle until victory is won. The more 
effectively propaganda has swayed the people as a whole and the more 
exclusive, rigorous and rigid the organisation, the greater the possibility of the 
triumph of its ideology. 


It follows, therefore, that the number of adherents can never be too large, 
whereas the number of members is apt to become too large rather than too 
small. 


When a whole nation has become imbued with an idea as a result of 
propaganda, the organising body can realise its aims with a handful of 
supporters. 


655 


There is, therefore, a certain fixed relationship between propaganda and 
organisation, and between the number of adherents and members. 


If the propaganda is good the organising body may be small, while the 
larger the number of adherents, the smaller the number of members. 


Conversely, if the propaganda be bad, the organising body must be large 
and if there be only a small number of adherents, the membership must be all 
the larger if the movement still genuinely hopes to be successful. 


The first task of the propagandist is to win over people who will 
subsequently belong to the organising body. The first duty of the organising 
body is to select and train men who will be capable of carrying on the 
propaganda. 


The second task of the propagandist is to disrupt the existing order of 
things and to saturate this order with the new teaching, while the second task of 
the organising body must be to fight for power, so that the doctrine may finally 


triumph. 


An ideological revolution will always be most successful, if the new 
ideology has been taught to the entire population, or if necessary, forced upon 
it subsequently, whilst, on the other hand, the movement itself, the organisation, 
should comprise only the minimum number of persons required to man the 
nerve-centres of the state in question. 


Put in another way, this means that in every great revolutionary 
movement of world-importance, the ideals of that movement must always first 
be propagated through the operation of propaganda. 


The propagandist must never tire in his efforts to make the new ideas 
clearly understood, to persuade others to adopt them and to endeavour to shake 
their confidence in the convictions they have hitherto held. 


In order that such propaganda should have a firm character, it must be 
based on an organisation. 


The organisation gains its members from any among those followers 
whom propaganda has won over and will grow the more rapidly if the work of 
propaganda be pushed forward intensively, and it will be all the more effective 
if the organisation at the back of it is vigorous and strong in itself. Hence, the 
supreme task of the organising body is to see to it that any discord or 


656 


differences which may arise among the members of the movement will not lead 
to a split and thereby cramp the work within the movement. 


Moreover, it is the duty of the organising body to see that the fighting 
spirit of the movement does not flag or die out, but that it is constantly 
reinvigorated and reinforced. 


It is not necessary that the number of members should increase 
indefinitely; on the contrary, in view of the fact that only a fraction of humanity 
has energy and courage, a movement which increases its own organisation 
indefinitely must of necessity one day become weakened thereby. 


Organisations, that is to say, memberships, which increase beyond 
certain limits gradually lose their fighting force and are no longer capable of 
backing up and turning to account propaganda on behalf of an ideal with the 
requisite verve and determination. 


Now, the greater and more revolutionary a doctrine is, the more active 
will be the spirit inspiring its body of members, because the very fact of the 
revolutionary nature of the doctrine implies danger for its champions and this 
suffices to frighten away the chicken-hearted and small-minded Philistines. 


In their hearts they may believe in the doctrine, but they are afraid to 
acknowledge their belief openly by becoming members of the movement. 


By reason of this very fact, however, an organisation inspired by a 
genuinely revolutionary ideal will attract as members only the most active of 
those who have been won over by its propaganda. 


It is in this activity on the part of the members, guaranteed by the process 
of natural selection, that we have the prerequisite conditions for the 
continuation of an active and spirited propaganda and also for the victorious 
struggle for the realisation of the ideal on which the movement is based. 


The greatest danger that can threaten a movement is an abnormal 
increase in the number of its members, owing to its too rapid success. 


So long as a movement has to carry on a hard and bitter fight, people of 
weak and fundamentally egotistic temperament will steer clear of it; but these 
will try to be accepted as members the moment the party appears likely to 
achieve, or has already achieved, a great measure of success. 


657 


It is for this reason that so many movements which are at first successful, 
slow down before reaching the fulfilment of their purpose and, from an inner 
weakness which cannot otherwise be explained, give up the struggle and 
finally disappear from the field. 


As a result of the early successes achieved, so many undesirable, 
unworthy and especially timid individuals become members of the movement 
that they are finally in the majority and overrule those who are filled with the 
fighting-spirit, use the movement to gain their own ends, dragging it down to 
their own petty level and do nothing to bring about the triumph of the original 
idea. The fire of the first fervour dies out, the fighting spirit flags and, as the 
bourgeois world is accustomed to remark (and in this case with some justice) 
the wine has become mixed with water and then it is, of course, impossible to 
achieve great things. 


For this reason it is necessary that a movement should, from the sheer 
instinct of self-preservation, close its list of membership the moment it 
becomes successful, while any further increase in its organisation should be 
undertaken only after the most careful precautions have been taken and after a 
painstaking sifting of those who apply for membership. 


Only thus will it be possible to keep the kernel of the movement intact, 
fresh and sound. 


Care must be taken that the conduct of the movement remains exclusively 
in the hands of the original nucleus, which means that this nucleus must direct 
the propaganda which aims at securing general recognition for the movement 
and is the central authority which decides what measures are to be adopted for 
the practical realisation of its ideals. 


The organisation should not only appoint the men who formed the 
original nucleus of the movement to all the important positions in those parts of 
the country that have been won over, but should see to it that the entire 
governing body is composed of such elements. 


This should continue until the maxims and doctrines of the party have 
become the foundation and substance of the new State. 


Only then will it be permissible gradually to transfer the reins to the 
hands of the constitution of that State which the spirit of the movement has 
created. 


658 


But this usually happens as the result of mutual rivalry, for here it is less 
a question of human intelligence than of the play of the forces whose 
development may indeed be foreseen from the start, but not perpetually 
controlled. 


All great movements, whether of a political or religious nature, owe 
their success to the recognition and adoption of these principles, and no 
durable success is conceivable if these laws are not observed. 


As director of propaganda for the Party, I took care not merely to 
prepare the ground for the size of the Movement in its subsequent stages, but I 
also adopted the most radical type of propaganda in order to make sure that 
none but the best would enter the organization. 


For the more radical and stirring my propaganda was, the more did it 
frighten away weak and wavering characters, thus preventing them from 
entering the first nucleus of our organisation. 


Perhaps they remained followers, but they did not advertise the fact, on 
the contrary, they maintained a discreet silence on the subject. 


Many thousands of persons then assured me that although they were in 
full agreement with us, they could not on any account become members of our 
Party. They said that the Movement was so radical that to take part in it as 
members would expose them to grave censure and even danger, so that nobody 
could take it amiss if an honest, peace-loving citizen chose to remain in the 
background, for the time being at least, though devoted whole-heartedly to our 
cause. 


This was all to the good. If all those men, who in their hearts did not 
approve of the Revolution, had joined our Movement as members at that time, 
we could regard ourselves to-day as a pious confraternity and not as a young 
Movement inspired with the spirit of combat. 


The lively and combative form which I gave to all our propaganda at that 
time fortified and guaranteed the radical tendency of our Movement, and the 
result was that, with few exceptions, only men of radical views were disposed 
to become members. 


It was due to the effect of our propaganda that, within a short period of 
time, hundreds of thousands of citizens not only became convinced in their 
hearts that we were right, but wished us victory, although personally they were 


659 


too timid to make sacrifices for that victory or even to fight for it. 


Up to the middle of 1921 the mere gaining of followers sufficed and was 
of value to the Movement, but in the summer of that year, certain events 
happened which made it seem opportune for us to bring our organisation into 
line with the manifest successes which the propaganda had achieved. 


An attempt made by a group of patriotic visionaries, supported by the 
chairman of the Party at that time, to take over the management of the party led, 
to the failure of this little intrigue, and, as the result of a motion carried 
unanimously at a general meeting of the members, the entire management of the 
Party was entrusted to me. 


At the same time a new statute was passed investing the chairman of the 
movement with absolute responsibility, abolishing the system of resolutions in 
committee and introducing in its stead a system of division of labour which, 
since that time, has worked excellently. 


From August Ist, 1921, onwards, I undertook the internal reorganisation 
of the Party and was supported by a number of excellent men. 


I shall mention them and their work individually in a postscript to the 
present work. In my endeavour to utilise the results gained by propaganda to 
the advantage of the organisation and thus to stabilise them, I had to abolish 
completely a number of established practices and introduce regulations which 
none of the other parties either possessed or recognised. 


In the years 1919-20 the Movement was controlled by a committee 
elected at meetings of the members, held in accordance with the constitution. 


The committee was composed of a treasurer and an assistant-treasurer, a 
secretary and an assistant-secretary and, at the head of it, a chairman and a 
vice-chairman. In addition to these there were a members’ representative, the 
director of propaganda, and various assessorial members. Comically enough, 
the committee embodied the very principle against which the Movement itself 
wanted to fight with all its energy, namely, the principle of parliamentarianism. 


It was evident that from the smallest local groups to the district and 
regional groups, the state groups and finally the supreme directorate for the 
Reich, the principle adopted incorporated the selfsame system under which we 
were all suffering and continue to suffer. 


660 


It was imperative to change this state of affairs forthwith, if this bad 
foundation in the internal organisation was not to jeopardise the Movement and 
render the fulfilment of its high mission impossible. 


The sessions of the committee at which minutes were read out, and at 
which resolutions were passed according to the vote of the majority, presented 
the picture of a miniature parliament. 


Here there was no such thing as personal responsibility, the same 
absurdities and paradoxes prevailed as in the great representative bodies of 
the State. 


Names were presented to this committee for appointment as secretaries, 
treasurers, members of the organisation, propaganda agents and God knows 
what else. 


Every single question was discussed by the committee as a whole and 
put to the vote. Accordingly, the director of propaganda voted on a question 
that concerned the man who had to do with the finances, and the latter, in his 
turn, voted on a question that concerned only the organising side as such, the 
organiser voting on a subject that had to do with the secretarial department, 
and so on. 


Why select a special man for propaganda, if treasurers, secretaries, 
members’ representatives etc., had to deliver judgment on questions 
concerning it? 


To a person of common sense that sort of thing seems as 
incomprehensible as 1t would be if, in a large manufacturing concern, the board 
of directors or technical experts belonging to other departments and other 
branches were called upon to decide questions which had nothing to do with 
their own particular job. 


I refused to countenance this kind of folly and after a short time I ceased 
to appear at the meetings of the committee. I did nothing except attend to my 
own department of propaganda and I did not permit any of the others to poke 
their noses into my activities. Conversely, I did not interfere in the affairs of 
others. 


When the new statute was approved and I was appointed chairman, I had 
the necessary authority and also the corresponding right to make short shrift of 
all that nonsense. 


661 


In the place of decisions by majority vote of the committee, the principle 
of absolute responsibility was introduced. 


The chairman is responsible for the whole control of the Movement. He 
apportions the work to be done among the members of the committee 
subordinate to him and for special work he selects other individuals. 


Each of these gentlemen must bear sole responsibility for the task 
assigned to him. He is subordinate only to the chairman, whose duty is to 
supervise the general collaboration, selecting the personnel and giving general 
directions as to how co-operation is to be achieved. 


This principle of absolute responsibility has gradually become a matter 
of course within the Movement, at least in so far as the management of the 
Party is concerned. 


In the small local groups and perhaps also in the regional and district 
groups it will take yet a long time before the principle can be thoroughly 
imposed, because the timid and inefficient are naturally opposed to it. 


For them the idea of bearing absolute responsibility for an action opens 
up an unpleasant prospect and they feel more at ease and safer if, faced witha 
difficult decision, they have the support of the majority on a so-called 
committee. 


But it seems to me a matter of absolute necessity to take a decisive stand 
against that view, to make no concessions whatsoever to this fear of 
responsibility, even though it will take some time before we can attain this 
concept of duty and ability in leadership, which will place in positions of 
authority only those who possess the necessary gifts and are selected for the 
work. 


In any case, a movement which has to fight against the absurdity of 
parliamentary institutions must itself be immune from them. Only thus will it 
have the requisite strength to carry on the struggle. 


It is absolutely certain that a movement which, in an era in which the 
majority principle holds good in every sphere of life, adopts as its fundamental 
principle that of leadership (and consequently the assumption of responsibility 
by the leaders), will one day succeed in abolishing and triumphing over 
existing conditions. 


662 


This idea made it necessary to reorganise our Movement internally. The 
logical development of this reorganisation brought about a clear-cut distinction 
between the economic section of the Movement and the general political 
management. The principle of personal responsibility was extended to all the 
administrative branches of the party and inevitably had a regenerating effect, 
by liberating them from political influences and allowing them to operate 
solely on economic principles. 


In the autumn of 1919, when I joined the Party, there were only six 
members. The Party had neither an office, officials, forms, a stamp, nor printed 
material of any sort. The committee first held its sittings in a restaurant in the 
Herrengasse and then in a cafe in the Gasteig. 


This state of affairs was intolerable, so I at once took action in the 
matter. I went around to several restaurants and hotels in Munich with the idea 
of renting a room in one of them for the use of the Party. 


In the old Sterneckerbrau im Tal, there was a small vault-like room 
which in earlier times had served the Bavarian Counsellors of the Holy Roman 
Empire as a tap-room when they foregathered. 


It was dark and dismal and accordingly well suited to its ancient uses, 
though less suited to the new purpose it was now destined to serve. The little 
street on which its one window looked out was so narrow that even on the 
brightest summer day the room remained dim and sombre. 


This became our first office. As the rent came to only fifty marks per 
month, (then an enormous sum for us) we could not expect very much and we 
dared not complain even when the wooden wainscoting was removed a few 
days before we took possession. This panelling had been specially put up for 
the Imperial Counsellors. The place began to look more like a tomb than an 
office. 


Still it marked an important step forward. By degrees, we had electric 
light installed and later on a telephone. A table and some borrowed chairs 
were put in, open bookshelves, and afterwards, a cupboard. Two sideboards, 
which belonged to the landlord, served to store our leaflets, placards, etc. 


As time went on, it proved impossible to direct the course of the 
Movement merely by holding a committee meeting once a week. 


The current business administration of the Movement could not be 


663 


regularly attended to unless we had a salaried official, but at that time it was 
very difficult for us to arrange anything of the kind. 


The Movement had still so few members that it was hard to find among 
them a suitable person for the job, who would be content with very little for 
himself and would at the same time be ready to meet the manifold demands 
which the Movement would make on his time and energy. 


After a long search we discovered a soldier who consented to become 
our first business-manager. His name was Schussler, an old war-time comrade 
of mine. At first he came to our new office every day between six and eight 
o’clock in the evening, later on he came from five to eight and subsequently for 
the whole afternoon; finally, it became a full-time job and he worked in the 
office from morning until late at night. 


He was an industrious, upright and thoroughly honest man, who was 
exceedingly painstaking and a loyal supporter of the Movement. He brought 
with him a small Adler typewriter of his own—it was the first typewriter to be 
used in the service of the Party. Subsequently, the Party bought it, paying for it 
in instalments. 


We needed a small safe in order to keep our papers and register of 
members out of harm’s way, not to hold our funds, which were then non- 
existent. On the contrary, our financial position was so hopeless that I often had 
to dip into my own personal savings. 


After eighteen months had passed our business quarters had become too 
small, so we moved to a new place in the Cornelius Strasse. 


Again our office was ina restaurant, but instead of one room we now 
had three smaller rooms and one large room with counters. At that time this 
appeared a wonderful thing to us. We remained in these premises until 
November 1923. 


In December 1920, we acquired the Volkischer Beobachter. This 
newspaper which, as its name implies, championed the vé/kisch cause, was 
now to become the organ of the National Socialist German Labour Party. 


At first it appeared twice weekly; but at the beginning of 1923 it became 
a daily paper, and at the end of August in the same year it began to appear in 
the form now so well known. 


664 


As a complete novice in journalism I then learned many a lesson for 
which I had to pay dearly. In contrast to the enormous number of papers in 
Jewish hands, there was at that time scarcely any important newspaper that 
defended the volkisch cause. 


This state of affairs ought to have provided us with food for thought. As I 
have often seen from experience, the reason for that state of things was, to a 
great extent, attributable to the incompetent way in which the business side of 
the so-called volkisch newspapers was managed. 


These were conducted too much according to the view that political 
opinion should be taken into consideration before efficiency—quite a mistaken 
attitude, inasmuch as political opinion should not be paraded, but should find 
expression in efficient work. 


The man who does valuable work for the nation expresses thereby the 
soundness of his political opinions, whereas another who merely talks about 
his opinions and does nothing that is of real value to the nation is detrimental to 
any real political opinion, and his attitude is also prejudicial to his particular 
political party. 


The Volkischer Beobachter was a so-called volkisch paper as its name 
indicates. It had all the good qualities, but still more the errors and 
weaknesses, inherent in all vo/kisch institutions. 


Though the reading-matter was excellent, the business side was 
conducted on very inefficient lines. Here also the underlying idea was that a 
volkisch newspaper ought to be subsidized by contributions from people 
holding volkisch views, and the fact was ignored that it had to make its way in 
competition with the others and that it was dishonest to expect the 
subscriptions of good patriots to make up for the mistakes and inefficiency of 
the management of the undertaking. I took care to alter these conditions 
promptly, for I recognised the danger inherent in them. Luck was on my side 
inasmuch as it brought me a man who, since that time, has rendered 
incalculable service to the Movement, not only as business-manager of the 
newspaper, but also as business-manager of the Party. 


In 1914, during the War, I made the acquaintance of Max Amann, who 
was then my superior officer and 1s to-day general business-manager of the 
Party. 


665 


During four years of war I had occasion to observe the unusual ability, 
diligence and rigorous conscientiousness of my future collaborator. In the 
summer of 1921 I applied to my old regimental comrade, whom I met one day 
by chance, and asked him to become business-manager of the Movement. 


At that time the Movement was passing through a grave crisis and I had 
reason to be dissatisfied with several of our officials, with one of whom I had 
had a very bitter experience. 


Amann then held a good position with good prospects. After long 
hesitation he agreed to my request, but only on condition that he would not be 
at the mercy of incompetent committees and would be responsible to one 
master, and one only. 


It is to the inestimable credit of this first business-manager of the Party, 
whose commercial knowledge is extensive and profound, that he brought order 
and probity into the various business concerns of the Party. 


Since that time these have remained exemplary and cannot be equalled, 
or excelled, by any other branches of the Movement. But as often happens in 
life, great ability provokes envy and disfavour; that was to be expected in this 
case and had to be put up with. 


From 1922 onwards we followed definite guiding principles as regards 
the commercial development of the Movement as well as in connection with its 
organisation. 


There already existed a central filing system, where the names and 
personal data of all the members were noted. The finances of the Party had 
been rendered sound. 


The current expenditure had to be covered by the current receipts and 
special receipts were used only for special expenditure. 


Thus, notwithstanding the difficulties of the time, the Movement 
remained practically free of debt, except for a few small current accounts. 
Indeed there was a steady increase in the funds. 


Things were managed as in a private business. The personnel employed 
held their jobs by virtue of their efficiency and could not in any way take cover 
behind their professed loyalty to the Party. 


666 


A good National Socialist proves his loyalty by the readiness, diligence 
and efficiency with which he discharges whatever duties are assigned to, him, 
in performing whatever work is allotted to him within the national community. 
The man who does not fulfil his duty in the job he holds cannot boast of a 
loyalty against which he actually transgresses. 


Adamant against all kinds of influence, the new business-manager of the 
party firmly maintained the standpoint that there were no sinecure posts in the 
party administration for followers and members of the Movement who did not 
want to work. 


A movement, which fights energetically against the corruption introduced 
into our civil service by the various political parties must be immune from that 
vice in its own administrative department. 


It happened that some men were taken on to the staff of the paper who 
had formerly been adherents of the Bavarian People’s Party, but whose work 
showed that they were excellently qualified for the job. 


The result of this experiment was, generally speaking, eminently 
satisfactory. It was owing to this honest and frank recognition of individual 
efficiency that the Movement won the hearts of its employees more readily and 
more profoundly than had ever been the case before. 


Subsequently these men became good National Socialists and remained 
so, not only professedly, but proved to be so by the steady, honest and 
conscientious work which they performed in the service of the new Movement. 


Although a well-qualified party member was preferred to another who 
had equal qualifications, but did not belong to the Party, nobody obtained a 
post merely by reason of the fact that he was a member of the Party. 


The rigid determination with which our new business-manager applied 
these principles and gradually put them into force, despite all opposition, 
turned out to be of great advantage to the Movement. 


To this we owe the fact that it was possible for us, during the difficult 
period of the inflation, when thousands of businesses failed and thousands of 
newspapers had to cease publication, not only to keep the commercial 
department of the Movement going and finance its activities, but also to make 
steady progress with the Volkischer Beobachter. At that time it came to be 
ranked among the big newspapers. 


667 


The year 1921 was of further importance by reason of the fact that, as 
chairman of the party, I slowly but steadily succeeded in putting a stop to 
criticism and interference by numerous members of committee with regard to 
various business concerns of the Party. 


This was important, because we could not get a capable man to take ona 
job if nincompoops were constantly allowed to butt in, pretending that they 
knew better, whereas in reality they left only chaos behind them. 


Then these wiseacres retired, for the most part quite modestly, to seek 
another field for their supervisory and animating activities. 


Some men seemed to have a mania for finding fault with everything and 
were, So to speak, always in a permanent state of pregnancy with magnificent 
plans, ideas, projects and methods. 


Naturally, their great aim and ideal was always the formation of a 
committee which, in its supervisory capacity, would be in a position to poke 
its nose into the efficient work being done by others. 


Many of these committee fiends failed to realise that it is offensive and 
contrary to the spirit of National Socialism if unauthorised people constantly 
interfere in the work of really competent persons. 


During those years I felt it to be my duty to safeguard against such 
annoyance all those who were performing good work or were entrusted with 
responsible task, to give them support so that they were guaranteed a free hand 
in their day’s work. 


The best means of rendering innocuous those committees, which either 
did nothing or hatched impracticable decisions, was to give them some real 
work to do. It was then amusing to see how the members would silently fade 
away and were soon nowhere to be found. 


It made me think of that great institution of the same kind, the Reichstag. 
How quickly its members would evanesce, if they were put to some real work 
instead of talking, especially if each member were made personally 
responsible for the work assigned to him. 


I always demanded that, as in private life so in the Movement, we should 
not abandon the search until the best, most honest and manifestly most 
competent person had been found for the position of official manager or leader, 


668 


as the case might be, in every business concern of the Movement. 


Once installed in his position he should be given absolute authority and 
full freedom of action in regard to his subordinates and at the same time be 
called upon to assume full responsibility towards his superiors. 


Nobody was placed ina position of authority over subordinates unless 
he himself was more competent than they to perform the work entrusted to 
them. In the course of two years I put my views more and more into practice, 
so that to-day, at least as far as the higher positions of authority in the 
Movement are concerned, they are accepted as a matter of course. 


The manifest success of this attitude was shown on November 9th, 1923. 
Four years previously, when I entered the Movement, it did not possess even a 
rubber stamp. 


On November 9th, 1923, the Party was dissolved and its property 
confiscated. This, including all objects of value and the newspaper, amounted 
to more than one hundred and seventy thousand gold marks.

CHAPTER XII: THE PROBLEM OF THE TRADE- 
UNIONS 


Owing to the rapid growth of the movement, we felt compelled in 1922 
to take a definite stand on a question which has not been fully solved even yet. 


In our efforts to discover the quickest and easiest way for the Movement 
to reach the heart of the broad masses, we were always confronted with the 
objection that the worker could never completely belong to us while his 
interests in the purely vocational and economic sphere were cared for by a 
political organisation conducted by men whose principles were quite different 
from ours. 


That was quite a serious objection. The general belief was that a 
workman engaged in some trade or calling could not exist if he did not belong 
to a trade-union. 


Not only were his professional interests thus protected, but his position 
in the factory or concern, would, in the long run, have become untenable, if he 
were not a member of a trade-union. 


The majority of the workers belonged to trade-unions. Generally 
speaking, the unions had conducted successfully the battle for the establishment 
of a definite scale of wages and had concluded agreements which guaranteed 
the worker a steady income. 


Undoubtedly, all workers benefited by the results of that campaign and, 
for honest men especially, conflicts of conscience must have arisen if they took 
the wages which had been assured through the struggle fought by the trade- 
unions and at the same time refrained from taking part in the fight. 


It was difficult to discuss this problem with the average bourgeois 
employer. He had no understanding (or did not wish to have any) for either the 
material or moral side of the question. 


Finally, his own supposed economic interests were, on principle, 
opposed to every kind of organisation which united the workmen that were 
dependent on him. Hence it was for the most part impossible to bring these 
bourgeois employers to take an impartial view of the situation. 


672 


Here, therefore, as in so many other cases, it was necessary to appeal to 
disinterested outsiders who would not be liable to fix their attention on the 
trees and fail to see the forest. 


With a little goodwill on their part, they could readily understand a state 
of affairs which is of the highest importance for our present and future 
existence. 


In the first volume of this book I have already expressed my views on the 
nature, purpose and necessity of trade-unions. There I adopted the standpoint 
that, unless measures are undertaken by the State (usually futile in such cases) 
or a new ideal is introduced in our education, which would change the attitude 
of the employer towards the worker, no other course will be open to the latter, 
except to defend his own interests himself by claiming his equal rights as a 
contracting party within the economic sphere of the nation’s existence. 


I stated further that this would conform to the ideal of a national 
community, if thereby social injustices could be redressed which would 
otherwise cause serious damage to the whole social structure. 


I stated, moreover, that the worker would always find it necessary to 
undertake this protective action as long as there were men among the 
employers who had no sense of their social obligations or even of the most 
elementary human rights, whilst I concluded by saying, that, if such self- 
defence be considered necessary, its form ought to be that of an association 
made up of the workers themselves on the basis of trade-unions. 


This was my general idea and it remained the same in 1922, but a clear 
and precise formula was still to be discovered. We could not be satisfied with 
merely understanding the problem; it was necessary to come to some 
conclusions that could be put into practice. 


The following questions had to be answered: 
(1) Are trade-unions necessary? 


(2) Should the National Socialist German Labour Party itself operate on 
a trade-unionist basis or have its members take part in trade-unionist activities 
in some form or other? 


(3) What form should a National Socialist trade-union take? What are the 
tasks confronting us and the ends we must try to attain? 


673 


(4) How can we establish trade-unions for such tasks and aims? 


I think that I have already answered the first question adequately. In the 
present state of affairs Iam convinced that we cannot possibly dispense with 
the trade-unions. On the contrary, they are among the most important 
institutions in the economic life of the nation. 


Not only are they important in the sphere of social policy but also, and 
even more so, in the national political sphere, for, when the great messes of a 
nation see their vital needs satisfied through a just trade-unionist movement, 
which is at the same time educating them, the stamina of the whole nation in its 
struggle for existence will be enormously reinforced thereby. Above all, the 
trade-unions are necessary as building stones for the future economic 
parliament, which will be made up of chambers representing the various 
professions and occupations. 


The second question is also easy to answer. If the trade-unionist 
movement is important, then it is clear that National Socialism ought to take a 
definite stand on that question, not only theoretically, but also in practice. But 
how? That is more difficult to decide. 


The National Socialist Movement, which aims at establishing the 
National Socialist vol/kisch State, must always bear in mind the principle that 
every future institution under that State must be evolved from the Movement 
itself. 


It is a great mistake to believe that, by the mere acquisition of supreme 
political power, we can suddenly bring about a definite reorganisation, from 
nothing, without the help of a certain reserve of men who have been trained 
beforehand, especially in the spirit of the Movement. 


Here, also, the principle holds good that the spirit is always more 
important than the external form which it animates, since this form can be 
created mechanically and quickly. 


For instance, the leadership principle may be imposed on an organised 
political community in a dictatorial way. But, this principle can become a 
living reality only when, by means of a gradual process of development from 
an extremely small nucleus, and by that process of elimination which the hard 
realities of life continually enforce, there is produced, after the lapse of years, 
the necessary material from which leaders, capable of carrying the principle 


674 


into practical effect, are chosen. 


It is out of the question to think that a scheme for the constitution of a 
State can be pulled out of a portfolio at a moment’s notice and ‘introduced’ by 
imperative orders from above. 


One may try that kind of thing, but the result will always be something 
that cannot endure, and may even prove abortive. 


This calls to mind the origin of the Weimar Constitution and the attempt 
to impose on the German people a new constitution and a new flag, neither of 
which had any inner relation to the vicissitudes of our nation’s history during 
the last half century. 


The National Socialist State must guard against all such experiments. It 
can only grow out of an organisation which has already existed for a long time. 


This organisation must be in itself the essence of National Socialist life, 
so that finally it may be able to establish a National Socialist State which will 
be a living reality. 


As I have already said the germ-cells of the economic chambers must be 
established in the various vocational representative bodies and especially in 
the trade-unions. If this subsequent vocational representation and the central 
economic parliament are to be National Socialist institutions, these important 
germ-cells must be vehicles of the National Socialist ideology. 


The institutions of the Movement must be transferred to the State; but the 
State cannot call into existence all of a sudden and as if by magic, 
corresponding organisations unless these are to remain completely lifeless. 


Looking at the matter from the highest standpoint, the National Socialist 
Movement will have to recognise the necessity for instituting its own trade- 
unionist activities. 

It must do so for a further reason, namely, because a real National 
Socialist education for the employer as well as for the employee, in the spirit 
of mutual co-operation within the common framework of the national 
community, cannot be secured by theoretical instruction, appeals and 
exhortations, but only through the struggle of daily life. 


In and through this struggle the Movement must educate the several large 


675 


economic groups and bring them closer to one another through a wider outlook. 
Without this preparatory work it would be sheer illusion to hope that a real 
national community could be brought into existence. 


Only the great Weltanschauung for which the Movement is fighting can 
serve to form by degrees that general attitude which the new era will one day 
prove to be internally and fundamentally sound and not mere outward show. 


Hence, the Movement must not only adopt a positive attitude towards the 
trade-unionist idea, it must go further; it must, by means of practical activity, 
provide the multitude of its members and adherents with the education 
requisite for the future National Socialist State. 


The answer to the third question follows from what has already been 
said. The National Socialist trade-union is not an instrument for class warfare, 
but a representative organ of the various professions and callings. 


The National Socialist State recognises no ‘classes’ but, from the 
political point of view, only citizens with absolutely equal rights and equal 
obligations corresponding thereto. 


Apart from these, it recognises subjects of the State who have no 
political rights whatsoever. 


According to the National Socialist concept, it is not the task of the 
trade-union to band together certain men within the national community and 
thus gradually to transform these men into a class, so as to use them ina 
conflict against other similarly organised groups within the national 
community. 


We certainly cannot assign this task to the trade-union as such. This was 
the task assigned to it the moment it became a fighting weapon in the hands of 
the Marxist. 


The trade-union is not naturally an instrument of class warfare; but the 
Marxists transformed it into an instrument for use in their own class struggle. 


They created the economic weapon which the international Jew uses for 
the purpose of destroying the economic foundations of free and independent 
national States, of ruining their national trade and industry and thereby 
enslaving free nations to serve Jewish world finance, which transcends all 
state boundaries. 


676 


In contradiction to this, the National Socialist trade-union must organise 
definite groups of those who participate in the economic life of the nation. 
They will thus enhance the security of the national economic system, 
reinforcing it by the elimination of all those anomalies which ultimately 
exercise a destructive influence on the social body of the nation, damage the 
vital forces of the national community, prejudice the welfare of the State and, 
by no means least, bring evil and destruction on economic life itself. 


In the hands of the National Socialist trade-union the strike is not, 
therefore, an instrument for disturbing and dislocating national production, but 
for increasing it and making it run smoothly, by fighting against all those abuses 
which, by reason of their non-social character, hinder efficiency in business 
and thereby hamper the existence of the whole nation. 


Individual efficiency is always in direct relation to the general social 
and legal position of the individual in the economic process, and to the 
consequent conviction that the economic prosperity of the nation must 
necessarily redound to the benefit of the individual citizen. 


The National Socialist employee will have to recognise the fact that his 
own material welfare is bound up with the economic prosperity of the nation. 


The National Socialist employer must recognise that the welfare and 
contentment of his employees are necessary prerequisites for the existence and 
development of his own economic prosperity. 


National Socialist workers and employers are both, at one and the same 
time, the representatives and administrators of the whole national community. 
The large measure of personal freedom which is accorded to them for their 
activities is to be explained by the fact that experience has shown that the 
productive powers of the individual are greater if he is accorded a generous 
measure of freedom than if he is coerced from above. 


Moreover, by according this freedom, we give free play to the natural 
process of selection which brings forward the ablest, most capable and most 
industrious. 


For the National Socialist trade-union, therefore, the strike 1s a means 
that may, and indeed must be, resorted to as long as there is not yet a National 
Socialist vélkisch State, but when that State is established it will, as a matter 
of course, abolish the class struggle between the two great groups made up of 


677 


employers and employees respectively. For that is a struggle which has always 
resulted in lessening national production and injuring the national community. 


In place of this struggle, the National Socialist State will undertake the 
task of caring for and defending the rights of all parties concerned. 


It will be the duty of the economic chambers to keep the national 
economic system in smooth working order and to remove whatever defects or 
errors may affect it adversely. 


Questions which are to-day settled only by the struggle of millions of 
people will then be settled in the representative chambers of trades and 
professions and in the central economic parliament. 


Thus employers and employees will no longer find themselves drawn 
into a mutual conflict over wages and hours of work, always to the detriment of 
the interests of both. 


They will solve these problems together before a higher authority, whose 
sole aim will be to safeguard the welfare of the national community and of the 
State. Here, as everywhere else, the inflexible principle must hold good that 
the interests of the country must come before party interests. 


The task of the National Socialist trade-union will be to educate and 
prepare its members to conform to these ideals, namely, that all must work 
together for the maintenance and security of our nation and its State, each one 
according to the abilities and powers with which Nature has endowed him and 
which have been developed and trained by the national community. 


Our fourth question was, ‘How can we establish trade-unions for such 
tasks and aims?’ It is by far the most difficult to answer. 


Generally speaking, it is easier to establish something in new territory 
than in old territory which already has its established institutions. 


It is easy to set up a new business in a district where there 1s no existing 
business of the same kind, but it is more difficult if the same kind of enterprise 
already exists and it is most difficult of all when the conditions are such that 
only one enterprise of this kind can prosper. 


In the latter case, the promoters of the new enterprise find themselves 
confronted not only with the problem of introducing their own business, but 


678 


also that of how to bring about the destruction of the other business already 
existing in the district, so that the new enterprise may prosper. 


It would be senseless to have a National Socialist trade, union side by 
side with other trade-unions, for the former must be thoroughly imbued with a 
feeling for the ideological nature of its task and the resulting obligation not to 
tolerate other similar or hostile institutions. 


It must also insist that it alone is necessary, to the exclusion of all the 
rest. It can come to no arrangement and no compromise with kindred 
tendencies, but must assert its own absolute and exclusive right to exist. 


There were two ways which might have led to such a development: 


(1) We could have established our own trade-union and then gradually 
taken up the fight against the Marxist international trade-unions. 


(2) We could have joined the Marxist trade-unions in an attempt to imbue 
them with a new spirit and, with the idea of transforming them into an 
instrument in the service of the new ideal. For the following reasons, it would 
have been inadvisable to choose the first method. Our financial situation was 
still the cause of much concern to us at that time and our resources were very 
slender. 


The effects of the inflation were steadily spreading and made the 
situation still more difficult, because at that time the trade-unions were unable 
to render their members any tangible service. 


From this point of view, there was no reason why the individual worker 
should pay his dues to the union. Even the Marxist unions then existing were on 
the point of collapse when, as the result of Herr Curio’s inspired Ruhr policy, 
millions suddenly poured into their coffers. This so-called ‘national’ 
Chancellor of the Reich should be dubbed the ‘saviour’ of the Marxist trade- 
unions. 


We could not count on similar financial facilities, and nobody would 
have felt inclined to join a new trade-union which, on account of its financial 
weakness, could not offer him the slightest material benefit. 


On the other hand, I had to guard against the danger of creating a new 
organisation of this kind which would only serve to provide ‘cushy jobs’ for 
men of little ability. 


679 


At that time the question of personnel played a most important role. I did 
not have a single man whom I could have called upon to carry out this 
important task. 


He who could have succeeded at that time in overthrowing the Marxist 
unions to make way for the triumph of the National Socialist corporative idea, 
which would have replaced this weapon of ruinous class warfare, could have 
been reckoned as one of the very greatest men our country had produced and 
his bust installed in the Valhalla at Regensburg for the admiration of posterity. 


But I knew of no person who could have qualified for such an honour. In 
this connection we must not be led astray by the fact that the international 
trade-unions are conducted by men of only mediocre significance. This fact is 
actually of no importance, for when those unions were founded there was 
nothing else of a similar kind in existence. 


To-day, the National Socialist Movement must fight against a monster 
organisation which has existed for a long time, and has been carefully thought 
out to the last detail. 


The assailant must always exercise more intelligence than the defender, 
if he is to overthrow the latter. 


The Marxist trade-unionist citadel may be governed to-day by mediocre 
leaders, but it cannot be taken by assault, except through the dauntless energy 
and genius of a superior leader on the other side. If such a leader cannot be 
found it is futile to haggle with Fate and even more foolish to try to make the 
attempt under a leader wanting in the necessary qualities. Here one must apply 
the maxim that in life it is often better to leave a thing alone for the time being, 
rather than try to do it by halves or do it badly, owing to a lack of suitable 
means. 


To this we had to add another consideration, which was not at all of a 
demagogic character. At that time I had, and I still have to-day, the firmly- 
rooted conviction that when one is engaged in a great ideological struggle in 
the political field, it would be a grave mistake to mix up economic questions 
with this struggle in its earlier stages. 


This applies particularly to our German people, because in their case, 
the economic struggle would immediately divert their energy from the political 


fight. 


680 


Once people are brought to believe that they can buy a little house with 
their savings they will devote themselves to the task of increasing their savings 
and no spare time will be left to them for the political struggle against those 
who, one way or another, intend one day to secure possession of the pennies 
that have been hoarded. 


Instead of participating in the political conflict on behalf of the opinions 
and convictions which they have been brought to accept, they will now go ‘all 
out’ for their ‘settlement’ idea and in the end they will fall between two stools. 


To-day the National Socialist Movement is at the beginning of its 
struggle. To a great extent it must first of all shape and develop its ideals. 


It must employ every ounce of its energy in the struggle to have its great 
ideals accepted, but this effort will not be crowned with success, unless the 
combined energies of the Movement be devoted exclusively to this struggle. 


To-day we have a classic example of how the militant strength of a 
people becomes paralysed when that people is too much taken up with purely 
economic problems. 


The Revolution which took place in November 1918, was not brought 
about by the trade-unions, but was carried out in spite of them, and the German 
bourgeoisie is not waging a political fight for the future of its country because 
it believes that that future can be amply secured by constructive work in the 
economic field. 


We must learn as lesson from such phenomena, because in our case the 
same thing would happen in the same circumstances. The more the combined 
strength of our Movement is concentrated in the political struggle, the more 
confidently may we count on being successful along our whole front, but if we 
busy ourselves prematurely with tradeunionist problems, settlement problems, 
etc., it will be to the detriment of our cause, taken as a whole. 


For, though these problems may be important, they cannot be solved in an 
adequate manner until we have political power in our hands and are able to 
use it in the service of these schemes. Until that day comes these problems can 
have only a paralysing effect on the Movement and if it takes them up too soon 
they will only be a hindrance in the effort to attain its ideological aims. 


It may then easily happen that trade-unionist considerations will decide 
the political trend of the Movement, instead of the Weltanschauung of the 


681 


Movement determining the course the trade-unions are to adopt. 


The Movement and the nation can derive advantage froma National 
Socialist trade-unionist organisation, only if the latter be so thoroughly 
inspired by National Socialist ideas that it runs no danger of falling into step 
behind the Marxist movement, for a National Socialist trade-union which 
considered itself only as a competitor against the Marxist unions would be 
worse than none. 


It must declare war against the Marxist trade-union, not only as an 
organisation but, above all, as an ideal. 


It must declare itself hostile to the idea of class and class warfare and, in 
place of this, it must declare itself the defender of the various vocational and 
professional interests of the German people. 


Considered from all these points of view it was not then advisable, nor 
is it yet advisable, to think of founding our own trade-union, unless somebody 
appeared who was obviously called upon by Fate to solve this particular 
problem. 


Therefore, there remained only two possible courses—either to 
recommend our own party members to leave the trade-unions in which they 
were enrolled, or to remain in them for the moment, with the idea of disrupting 
them as much as possible. 


In general, I recommended the latter alternative. There could be nothing 
against this, especially in 1922-1923, since, during the inflation, the financial 
gain which the trade-unions derived from the few members who belonged to 
our, as yet, youthful Movement was negligible, but the damage done to the 
unions was very considerable since the adherents of National Socialism were 
their most inveterate critics and consequently exerted a disintegrating influence 
from within. 


I entirely discountenanced all experiments which were destined from the 
very beginning to be unsuccessful. I would have considered it criminal to 
deprive a worker of some part of his scanty earnings on behalf of an 
organisation which, according to my inner conviction, could not promise any 
real advantage to its members. 


If a new political party fades out of existence it is seldom a matter for 
regret, but nearly always for congratulation and nobody has a right to 


682 


complain, for what each individual contributes to a political movement is 
given with the idea that he may receive no return for it. 


The man who pays his dues to a trade-union has the right to expect that 
the promises made to him will be kept in return; if this is not done, then the 
promoters of such a trade-union are swindlers, or at least irresponsible 
persons who ought to be brought to book. 


The course of action we pursued in 1922 was adopted in accordance 
with these principles. Others thought they knew better and founded trade- 
unions. 


They upbraided us for being short-sighted and failing to see into the 
future, but it did not take long for these organisations to disappear and the 
result was the same as in our own case, with this difference, that we had 
deceived neither ourselves nor other people.

CHAPTER XIII: THE GERMAN POLICY OF 
ALLIANCES 


The erratic manner in which the foreign affairs of the Reich were 
conducted was due to a lack of sound guiding principles in the formation of 
practical and useful alliances. 


Not only did this state of affairs continue after the Revolution, but it 
became even worse. If the confused state of our political ideas in general 
before the War may be looked upon as the chief cause of our defective foreign 
policy, in the post-war period this must be attributed to a lack of honest 
intentions. 


It was natural that those parties which had finally achieved their 
destructive purpose by means of the Revolution were not interested in the 
adoption of a policy of alliances which must ultimately result in the restoration 
of a free German State. 


A development in this direction would not have been in conformity with 
the purposes of the November crime; it would have interrupted, or even put an 
end to, the internationalisation of German national economy and German 
labour. Above all, it would put an end to the political repercussions within the 
country resulting from a foreign policy which aimed at liberating Germany, 
which would, in the long run, have been fatal to those who now wield the 
power in the Reich. 


One cannot imagine the revival of a nation unless that revival be 
preceded by a process of nationalisation. Conversely, every important success 
in the field of foreign politics must call forth a favourable reaction at home. 


Experience proves that every struggle for liberty increases national 
sentiment and national self-confidence and thereby gives rise to a keener 
awareness of anti-national elements and tendencies. 


Conditions and persons that may be tolerated and even pass unnoticed in 
times of peace will not only become the object of aversion when national 
enthusiasm is aroused, but will even provoke positive opposition, which 
frequently turns out disastrous for them. 


In this connection we may recall the spy-scare that became prevalent 


686 


when the war broke out, when human passion suddenly manifested itself to 
such a heightened degree as to lead to the most brutal persecutions, often 
without justifiable grounds, although everybody knows that the spy danger is 
greater during long periods of peace. Yet, for obvious reasons, it does not then 
attract a similar amount of public attention. 


For this reason the subtle instinct of those parasites of the State who 
came to the surface of the national body as a result of the events which took 
place in November 1918 makes them feel at once that a movement to restore 
the freedom of our people, supported by a wise foreign policy and the 
consequent awakening of national feeling—which would possibly mean the 
end of their own criminal existence. 


Thus we may explain the fact that, since 1918, the competent government 
departments have failed as regards foreign policy and the Government of the 
country has practically always worked systematically against the interests of 
the German nation, for that which at first sight seemed a matter of chance 
proved, on closer examination, to be a logical advance along the lines first 
openly followed by those responsible for the November Revolution of 1918. 


Undoubtedly a distinction ought to be made between, (1) the responsible 
administrators of our affairs of State, or rather those who ought to be 
responsible; (2) the average run of our parliamentary ‘politicians,’ and (3) the 
bulk of our people, whose sheepish docility corresponds to their want of 
intelligence. 


The first know what they want. 


The second fall into line with them, either because they know what is 
afoot, or because they have not the courage to take an uncompromising stand 
against a course which they know and feel to be detrimental. 


The third just submit because they are too stupid to understand. While the 
National Socialist German Labour Party was only a small and practically 
unknown society, problems of foreign policy could have only a secondary 
importance in the eyes of many of its members. 


This was the case especially because our Movement has always 
proclaimed, and must proclaim, the principle, that the freedom of the country in 
its foreign relations is not a gift that will be bestowed upon us by Heaven or by 
any earthly powers, but can only be the fruit of a development of our inner 


687 


strength. 


Only by fist rooting out the causes which led to our collapse and by 
eliminating all those who are profiting by that collapse can we establish the 
conditions necessary for the struggle for freedom abroad. 


It will be easily understood, therefore, why during the early stages of our 
young Movement’s development, we preferred to concentrate on the problem 
of internal reform rather than on foreign policy. 


But, when the small and insignificant society expanded and finally 
outgrew its first framework, and the young organisation assumed the 
importance of a great association, we then felt 1t incumbent upon us to take a 
definite stand on problems regarding the development of a foreign policy. 


It was necessary to lay down fundamental principles which would not 
only be in accord with the basic ideas of our Weltanschauung, but would 
actually be an outcome of it. 


Just because our people have had no political education in matters 
concerning our relations abroad, it is necessary for the youthful Movement to 
teach its leaders and also the masses of the people, the guiding principles 
governing our foreign political attitude. This is the prerequisite for the 
practical execution of any measures adopted in our foreign policy of the future 
with the object of regaining the freedom of our people and of re-establishing 
the genuine sovereignty of the Reich. 


The fundamental and guiding principles which we must always bear in 
mind when studying this question are, that foreign policy is only a means to an 
end and that the sole end to be pursued is the welfare of our own people. 


Every problem in foreign politics must be considered solely from the 
following point of view: Will such and such a solution prove advantageous to 
our people now or in the future, or will it injure their interests? 


That is the only question which must be considered in dealing with any 
problem. Party politics, religious considerations, humanitarian ideals—all 
such and all other preoccupations must, without compromise, give way to this. 


Before the War, the purpose to which German foreign policy should have 
been directed was to ensure the supply of material necessities for the 
maintenance of our people and their children, to prepare means for the 


688 


attainment of this end and the gaining of the necessary support in the shape of 
advantageous alliances. 


The task to be accomplished is the same to-day, but with this difference, 
that in pre-war times it was a question of caring for the maintenance of the 
German people, with the help of the power which a strong and independent 
State then possessed, but our task to-day is to make our nation powerful once 
again by re-establishing a strong and independent State. 


The re-establishment of such a State is the prerequisite and necessary 
condition which must be fulfilled in order that we may be able subsequently to 
put into practice a foreign policy which will serve to guarantee the existence, 
welfare and subsistence of our people in the future. 


In other words, the aim which Germany ought to pursue to-day in her 
foreign policy is to prepare the way for the recovery of her liberty to-morrow. 


In this connection there is a fundamental principle which we must bear in 
mind, namely, that the possibility of winning back the independence of a nation 
is not absolutely bound up with territorial integrity. 


It will suffice if a remnant, no matter how small, of a nation and State 
still exists, provided it possesses the necessary independence to become not 
only the vehicle of the common spirit of the whole people, but also to prepare 
the way for the military fight for the nation’s liberty. Ifa people numbering a 
hundred million souls tolerates the yoke of common slavery in order to prevent 
the territory belonging to its State from being broken up and divided, that is 
worse than it such a State and such a people were dismembered, and only one 
fragment still retained its complete independence. 


Of course, the proviso here is that this fragment is inspired with a 
consciousness of the solemn duty that devolves upon it, not only persistently to 
proclaim its spiritual and cultural unity, but also to make the necessary 
preparations for the military conflict which will finally liberate and re-unite 
the fragments suffering under oppression. 


One must also bear in mind the fact that the restoration of lost territories 
which were formerly part of the State, both ethnologically and politically, 
must, in the first instance, be a question of winning back political power and 
independence for the mother-country itself, 


In such cases, the special interests of the lost territories must be 


689 


uncompromisingly regarded as a matter of secondary importance in the face of 
the one main task, which is to win back the freedom of the mother-country. 


The liberation of oppressed or detached fragments of the population, or 
provinces of an empire, cannot be accomplished by reason of the wishes of the 
oppressed or the protests of the bereaved mother-country, but only by resort to 
force on the part of those sections of the one-time united parent-country which 
have still more or less retained their sovereign rights. 


Therefore, the first condition for the reconquest of lost territories is 
intensive promotion of the welfare, and reinforcement of the strength, of that 
portion of the State which remained intact after the partition. It must be allied 
to a cherished and indestructible determination to consecrate the fresh strength 
thus being developed to the cause of liberating and uniting the entire nation 
when the time is ripe. 


That is to say, the interests of the separated territories must be 
subordinated to a single purpose, namely, to gain for the remaining portion of 
the original State that degree of political strength and power necessary to 
oppose the will of the hostile victor. 


Oppressed territories are not returned to the bosom of their common 
parent-country as a result of heated protests, but only by the power of the 
sword. 


The forging of this sword must be the aim of the domestic policy adopted 
by a country’s government, whereas it is the object of foreign policy to 
safeguard the forging process and to gain allies. 


In the first volume of this book I discussed the inadequacy of our policy 
of alliances before the War. There were four possible ways of securing the 
necessary foodstuffs for the maintenance of our people. Of these ways, the 
fourth, which was the most unfavourable, was chosen: Instead of a sound 
policy of territorial expansion in Europe, our rulers embarked on a policy of 
colonial and trade expansion. 


Their policy was the more mistaken, inasmuch as they presumed that in 
this way the danger of an armed conflict would be averted. 


The result of their attempt to sit on two stools at the same time might 
have been foreseen, they fell between them, and the World War was only the 
final reckoning which the Reich had to pay for the failure of its foreign policy. 


690 


The course that should have been adopted in those days was the third, 
which I indicated, namely, to increase the strength of the Reich as a continental 
Power by the acquisition of new territory in Europe. 


At the same time, a further expansion through the subsequent acquisition 
of colonial territory, might thus have been brought within the range of 
possibility. 


Of course, this policy could not have been carried through except in 
alliance with Britain, or by making such an abnormal effort to increase the 
country’s military strength and armament that, for forty or fifty years, all 
cultural undertakings would have had to be completely relegated to the 
background. 


This would have been justifiable, for the cultural importance of a nation 
is almost always dependent on its political freedom and independence. 


Political freedom is a prerequisite condition for the existence, or rather 
the growth, of culture. Accordingly, no sacrifice can be too great when there is 
a question of securing the political freedom of a nation. 


The sacrifices which have to be made in the sphere of general culture, in 
favour of an intensive strengthening of the military power of the State will be 
richly rewarded later on. 


Indeed, it may be asserted that such a concentrated effort to preserve the 
independence of the State is usually succeeded by a certain easing of tension or 
is counterbalanced by a sudden blossoming forth of the hitherto neglected 
cultural spirit of the nation. 


Thus Greece flourished during the great Periclean era after the miseries 
she had suffered during the Persian Wars, and the Roman Republic turned its 
energies to the cultivation of a higher civilisation when it was freed from the 
stress and troubles of the Punic Wars. 


Of course, it is not to be expected that a parliamentary majority of 
cowardly and stupid people would ever be capable of deciding on such a 
resolute policy entailing the absolute subordination of all other national 
interests to the one sole task of preparing for a future conflict of arms which 
would result in establishing the security of the State. 


The father of Frederick the Great sacrificed everything in order to be 


691 


ready for such a conflict; but the fathers of our absurd parliamentarian 
democracy, with the Jewish hall-mark, could not do so. That is why, in pre- 
war times, the military preparations necessary to enable us to conquer new 
territory in Europe were only very mediocre, so that it was difficult to 
dispense with the support of really useful allies. 


Those who directed our foreign affairs would not entertain the bare idea 
of systematically preparing for war. They rejected every plan for the 
acquisition of territory in Europe and, by preferring a policy of colonial and 
trade expansion, they sacrificed the alliance with England, which was then 
possible. 


At the same time, they neglected to seek the support of Russia, which 
would have been a logical proceeding. Finally, they stumbled into the World 
War, abandoned by all except the ill-starred Habsburgs. 


The characteristic of our present foreign policy is that it follows no 
discernible or even intelligible line of action. 


Whereas before the War, a mistake was made in taking the fourth way 
that I have mentioned, and in pursuing it in a half-hearted manner, since the 
Revolution not even the then keenest observer can detect any attempt to pursue 
a definite course. 


Even more than before the War, there is absolutely no such thing as a 
systematic plan, except systematic attempts to destroy the last possibility of a 
national revival. 


If we make an impartial examination of the situation existing in Europe 
to-day as far as concerns the relation of the various Powers to one another, we 
can establish the following facts. 


For the past three hundred years the history of our Continent has been 
definitely determined by Britain’s efforts to preserve the balance of power in 
Europe, thus ensuring the necessary protection of her own rear while she 
pursued the great aims of British world-policy. 


The traditional tendency of British diplomacy ever since the reign of 
Queen Elizabeth has been to employ systematically every possible means to 
prevent any one Power from attaining a preponderant position over the other 
European Powers and, if necessary, to break that preponderance by means of 
armed intervention. 


692 


The only German parallel to this has been the tradition of the Prussian 
Army. Throughout the centuries Britain has adopted various methods to 
achieve her ends, choosing them according to the actual situation or the task to 
be faced; but the will and determination to use them has always been the same. 


The more difficult Britain’s position became in the course of history, the 
more did the British Imperial Government consider it necessary to maintain a 
condition of political paralysis among the various European States, as a result 
of their mutual rivalries. 


When the North American colonies obtained their political 
independence, it became still more necessary for Britain to make every effort 
to establish and maintain the defence of her flank in Europe. 


In accordance with this policy, Britain, after having crushed the great 
naval Powers, Spain and Holland, concentrated all her forces against the 
increasing strength of France, until she brought about the downfall of Napoleon 
Bonaparte and thereby destroyed the military hegemony of France, her most 
dangerous rival. 


The change in the attitude of British statesmen towards Germany took 
place only very slowly, because the German nation did not represent an 
obvious danger for Britain as long as it lacked national unification, and 
because the current of public opinion in Britain—long moulded along certain 
lines for political purposes—could be directed into a fresh channel only by 
slow degrees. 


In this case the calm reflections of the statesman are transformed into 
sentimental values which are not only more telling in effect, but also more 
permanent. 


When the statesman has attained one of his ends he immediately turns his 
thoughts to others; but only by degrees and by the slow process of propaganda, 
can the sentiment of the masses be shaped into an instrument for the attainment 
of the new aims which their leaders have chosen. 


As early as 1870/71, Britain had, however, decided on the new stand she 
would take. On certain occasions minor oscillations in that policy were caused 
by the growing influence of America on the commercial markets of the world 
and also by the increasing political power of Russia. Unfortunately, Germany 
did not take advantage of these and, therefore, the original tendency of British 


693 


diplomacy was reinforced. 


Britain looked upon Germany as a Power which was of importance 
commercially and politically and which, partly because of its enormous 
industrial development, was assuming such threatening proportions that the two 
countries were already contending against one another in the same sphere. 


The so-called peaceful conquest of the world by commercial enterprise, 
which, in the eyes of those who governed our public affairs at that time, 
represented the highest peak of human wisdom, was just the thing that led 
British statesmen to adopt a policy of resistance. 


That this resistance assumed the form of organised aggression on a vast 
scale was in full conformity with a type of statesmanship which did not aim at 
the maintenance of a dubious world peace, but aimed at the consolidation of 
British world-mastery. 


In carrying out this policy, Britain allied herself with all those countries 
which were of any military importance and this was in keeping with her 
traditional caution in estimating the power of her adversary and also in 
recognising her own temporary weakness. 


That line of conduct cannot be called unscrupulous, because such a 
comprehensive organisation for war purposes must not be judged from the 
heroic point of view, but from that of expediency. 


The object of a diplomatic policy is not to see that a nation perishes 
heroically, but rather that it survives. Hence, every road that leads to this goal 
is justifiable and failure to take it must be looked upon as criminal neglect of 


duty. 


When the German Revolution took place, Britain’s fears of German 
world-hegemony were laid to rest. From that time onward Britain has not been 
interested in erasing Germany from the map of Europe. 


On the contrary, the astounding collapse which took place in November 
1918, found British diplomacy confronted with a situation which at first 
appeared incredible. 


For four and a half years the British Empire had fought to break the 
presumed preponderance of a continental Power. A sudden collapse then 
occurred which apparently removed this Power from the foreground of 


694 


European affairs. 


Germany betrayed such a lack of even the primordial instinct of self- 
preservation, that European equilibrium was destroyed within forty-eight 
hours. Germany was annihilated and France became the first political Power 
on the continent of Europe. 


The tremendous propaganda which was carried on during the War for the 
purpose of encouraging the British public to ‘stick it out’ to the end aroused all 
the primitive instincts and passions of the populace and was bound eventually 
to act as a drag on the decisions of British statesmen. 


With the colonial, economic and commercial destruction of Germany, 
Britain’s war aims were realised. Anything in excess of these aims was an 
obstacle to the furtherance of British interests. 


Only the enemies of Britain could profit by the disappearance of 
Germany as a great continental Power in Europe. 


In November 1918, however, and up to the summer of 1919, it was not 
possible for Britain to change her diplomatic attitude, because during the long 
war she had appealed, more than ever before, to the feelings of the populace. 
In view of the feeling prevalent among her own people, Britain could not 
change her foreign policy. 


Another reason which rendered this impossible was the military strength 
to which other European Powers had now attained. 


France had taken the direction of affairs into her own hands and could 
impose her law upon the others. During those months of negotiation and 
bargaining the only Power that could have altered the course which things 
were taking was Germany herself but Germany was torn asunder by a civil 
war, and had declared through the medium of her so-called statesmen that she 
was ready to accept any and every dictate imposed on her. 


Now, in the history of nations, when a nation loses its instinct for self- 
preservation and ceases to be a possible active ally, it sinks to the level of an 
enslaved nation and its territory is fated to deteriorate into a colony. 


The only possible course which Britain could adopt in order to prevent 
France from becoming too powerful was to participate in her lust for 
agerandisement. 


695 


Actually, Britain had not realised her war aims. Not only had she failed 
to prevent a continental Power from predominating and thus upsetting the 
balance of power in Europe, but she had helped to bring about this very 
situation and in an acute degree. In 1914, Germany, considered as a military 
State, was wedged in between two countries, one of which equalled, while the 
other excelled her in military strength. 


Then there was Britain’s supremacy at sea. France and Russia alone 
hindered and opposed the excessive aggrandisement of Germany. 


The unfavourable geographical situation of the Reich, from the military 
point of view, might be looked upon as another coefficient of security against 
an exaggerated increase of German power. 


In the event of a conflict with Britain, Germany’s seaboard, being short 
and cramped, was unfavourable from the military point of view, whilst her 
frontiers on land were too extensive and open to attack. 


France’s position is different to-day. She is the foremost military Power, 
without a serious rival on the Continent. Her southern frontiers are practically 
secure from attack by Spain and Italy, she is safeguarded against Germany by 
the prostrate condition of our country. 


A long stretch of her coast-line faces the vital nerve-centre of the British 
Empire. Not only could French aeroplanes and long-range batteries attack the 
vital industrial, commercial and administrative, centres in Great Britain, but 
submarines could threaten the great British commercial routes. 


A submarine campaign based on France’s long Atlantic coast and on the 
European and North African coasts of the Mediterranean, would have 
disastrous consequences for Britain. Thus the political results of the war to 
prevent the development of German power was the creation of French 
hegemony on the Continent. 


The military result was the consolidation of France as the first 
continental Power and the recognition of American equality at sea. The 
economic result was the cession of great spheres of British interests to her 
former allies and associates. Just as Britain’s traditional policy renders the 
Balkanisation of Europe desirable and necessary up to a certain point, France 
aims at the Balkanisation of Germany. 


What Britain has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to 


696 


prevent any one continental Power in Europe from attaining a position of 
world-importance. Therefore, Britain wishes to maintain the balance of power 
in Europe, for this appears to be the prerequisite of British world hegemony. 


What France has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to 
prevent Germany from becoming a homogeneous Power. Therefore, France 
wants to maintain a system of small German States, whose forces would 
balance one another and over which there would be no central government. 


This, in conjunction with the French occupation of the left bank of the 
Rhine, would furnish the conditions necessary for the establishment and 
guarantee of French hegemony in Europe. 


The final aims of French diplomacy will inevitably be in perpetual 
opposition to the ultimate tendencies of British statesmanship. 


Taking these considerations as a starting-point, anyone who investigates 
the possible alliances which Germany could form to-day, is forced to the 
conclusion that the only course open to Germany is a rapprochement with 
Great Britain. 


Although the consequences of Britain’s war policy were, and are, 
disastrous for Germany, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that, as things 
stand to-day, Britain’s vital interests no longer demand the destruction of 
Germany. 


On the contrary, British policy must tend more and more, from year to 
year, towards curbing France’s unbridled lust for hegemony. 


Now, a policy of alliances cannot be pursued by bearing past grievances 
in mind, but it can be rendered fruitful by taking account of past experiences. 


Experience should have taught us that alliances formed for negative 
purposes are intrinsically weak. The destinies of nations can be welded 
together only by the prospect of a common success, of common gain and 
conquest, in short, a common extension of power for both contracting parties. 


Our people’s lack of insight in questions of foreign politics is clearly 
demonstrated by the reports in the daily press, which talk about the “pro- 
German attitude’ of one or the other foreign statesman, this assumed pro- 
German attitude being taken as a special guarantee that such persons will 
champion a policy that will be advantageous to our people. 


697 


That kind of talk is absurd to an incredible degree and reckons with the 
unparalleled simplicity of the average German Philistine when he comes to 
talking politics. 


There is no British, American, or Italian statesman who could ever be 
described as ‘pro-German.’ Every British statesman is, first and foremost, a 
Britisher, the American statesman, an American, and no Italian statesman 
would be prepared to adopt a policy that was not pro-Italian. 


Therefore, anyone who expects to form alliances with foreign nations on 
the basis of a pro-German feeling among the statesmen of other countries is 
either a fool or a deceiver. 


The necessary condition for linking together the destinies of nations is 
never mutual esteem or mutual sympathy, but rather the prospect of advantages 
accruing to the contracting parties. 


Although it is true that a British statesman will always follow a pro- 
British and not a pro-German policy, it is also true that certain definite 
interests involved in this pro-British policy may, for various reasons, coincide 
with German interests. 


Naturally, that can be so only to a certain degree and the situation may 
one day be completely reversed. But the art of the statesman consists in finding 
at the crucial moment, for the execution of his own vital policy, those allies 
who must, in their own interests, adopt a similar course. 


The practical application of these principles at the present time must 
depend on the answers to the following questions: What States are not vitally 
interested in the fact that, by the complete abolition of a German Central 
Europe, the economic and military power of France has reached a position of 
absolute hegemony? 


Which are the States that, in consideration of the conditions which are 
essential to their own existence and in view of the tradition that has hitherto 
been followed in conducting their foreign policy, envisage such a development 
as a menace to their own future? 


One point on which we must be clear is that France is, and will remain, 
the implacable enemy of Germany. 


It does not matter what governments have ruled or will rule in France, 


698 


whether Bourbon or Jacobin, Napoleonist or bourgeois-democratic, clerical 
Republican or Red Bolshevik, their foreign policy will always be directed 
towards acquiring possession of the Rhine frontier and consolidating France’s 
position on this river by disuniting and dismembering Germany. 


Britain did not want Germany to be a world-power, but France did not 
want Germany as a Power to exist at all—a very different matter! 


To-day we are not fighting for our position as a world-power, but only 
for the existence of our country, for national unity and our children’s daily 
bread. 


Taking this point of view into consideration, only two States remain to us 
as possible allies in Europe, namely, Britain and Italy. 


Britain is by no means desirous of having a France on whose military 
power there is no check in Europe, with the result that she might one day 
pursue a policy which, in some way or other, would inevitably conflict with 
British interests. Nor can Britain be pleased to see France in possession of 
such enormous coal and iron fields in Western Europe, which might make it 
possible for her one day to play a role in world-commerce which might 
endanger British interests. 


Moreover, Britain will never be desirous of having a France whose 
political position on the Continent, owing to the dismemberment of the rest of 
Europe, seems so absolutely assured that she is riot only able to resume a 
French world-policy on a large scale, but even finds herself compelled to do 
SO. 


It would be possible for an enemy to drop nightly a thousand times as 
many bombs as the Zeppelins did in the past. The military predominance of 
France weighs heavily on the minds of the British. 


Italy is another Power which cannot, and surely will not, welcome any 
further strengthening of France’s power in Europe. 


The future of Italy will be conditioned by developments in the territories 
bordering on the Mediterranean. The reason that made Italy come into the War 
was not a desire to contribute towards the aggrandisement of France, but rather 
to deal her hated Adriatic rival a mortal blow. 


Any further increase of France’s power on the Continent would hamper 


699 


the development of Italy’s future, and Italy does not deceive herself into 
thinking that racial kinship between the nations will in any way eliminate 
rivalries. 


Serious and impartial consideration proves that it is these two Powers, 
Great Britain and Italy, whose natural interests not only do not run counter to 
the conditions essential to the existence of the German nation, but are to a 
certain extent identical with them. 


When we consider the possibility of alliances we must be careful not to 
lose sight of three factors. 


The first factor concerns ourselves; the other two concern the States in 
question. 


Is it at all possible to conclude an alliance with Germany as she is to- 
day? 


Can a Power which would enter into an alliance for the purpose of 
securing assistance in the execution of its own offensive aims form an alliance 
with a State, whose rulers have, for years, presented a spectacle of deplorable 
incompetence and pacifist cowardice? A State where the majority of the 
nation, blinded by democratic and Marxist teachings, betrays the interests of its 
own people and country in a manner that cries to Heaven for vengeance? 


As things stand to-day, can any Power hope to establish useful relations 
with a State and hope to fight together for the furtherance of their common 
interests, if this State has neither the will nor the courage to lift a finger in 
defence of its bare existence? 


Can a Power for which an alliance must be much more than a pact to 
guarantee a state of slow decomposition on the lines of the old and disastrous 
Triple Alliance, associate itself for life or death with a State whose most 
characteristic signs of activity consist in an abject servility in external 
relations and a scandalous repression of the national spirit at home? 


Can such a Power be associated with a State in which there is nothing of 
greatness, because its whole policy does not deserve it? 


Or can alliances be made with governments which are in the hands of 
men who are despised by their own fellow-citizens and are consequently not 
respected abroad? 


700 


Never! 


A self-respecting Power which expects something more from alliances 
than commissions for greedy parliamentarians will not, and cannot, enter into 
an alliance with our present-day Germany. 


Our present inability to form alliances furnishes the principal and most 
profound reason for the solidarity of the enemies who are robbing us. 


Because Germany does not defend herself in any way apart from the 
flamboyant protests of our parliamentarian elect; because there is no reason 
why the rest of the world should take up the fight in our defence; and because 
God does not follow the principle of granting freedom to a nation of cowards, 
despite all the blubbering prayers addressed to Him by our ‘patriotic’ 
associations; even those States which have not a direct interest in our 
annihilation cannot do otherwise than participate in France’s campaign of 
plunder—if for no other reason than that, by their participation, they at least 
prevent France from being the sole country to be aggrandised thereby. 


In the second place, we must not underestimate the difficulty of changing 
the opinion of the bulk of the population in former enemy countries, which had 
been influenced in a certain direction by means of propaganda. 


When a foreign nation has for years been presented to the public as a 
horde of ‘Huns,’ ‘robbers,’ ‘Vandals,’ etc., it cannot suddenly be presented as 
something different, and the enemy of yesterday cannot be recommended as the 
ally of to-morrow. 


A third factor, however, deserves greater attention, since it is of 
essential importance for the establishment of future alliances in Europe. 


From the political point of view it is not in the interests of Great Britain 
that Germany should be ruined still more, but such a development would be 
very much in the interests of the Jews who manipulate the international money- 
markets. 


The cleavage between official, or rather traditional, British 
statesmanship and the controlling influence of the Jew on the money-markets is 
nowhere so clearly manifested as in the various attitudes adopted towards 
problems of British foreign policy. 


Contrary to the interests and welfare of Great Britain, Jewish finance 


701 


demands not only the absolute economic destruction of Germany, but its 
complete political enslavement. 


The internationalisation of our German economic system, that is to say, 
the transference of our productive forces to the control of Jewish international 
finance, can be completely carried out only in a State that has been politically 
Bolshevised. 


But the Marxist fighting forces of international and Jewish stock- 
exchange capital cannot finally smash the German national State without 
friendly, help from outside. 


To this end the armies of France will have to attack Germany until the 
Reich, inwardly cowed, succumbs to the Bolshevist storm-troops of 
international money-grubbing Jewry. 


Hence it is that, at the present time, the Jew is the chief agitator for the 
complete destruction of Germany. 


Whenever we read of Germany being attacked in any part of the world 
the Jew is always the instigator. 


In peace-time as well as during the War the Jewish-Marxist stock- 
exchange press systematically stirred up hatred against Germany, until one 
State after another abandoned its neutrality and placed itself at the service of 
the Allies in the World War, even against the real interests of its own people. 


The Jewish way of reasoning is quite clear. The Bolshevisation of 
Germany, that is to say, the extermination of the vélkisch and national German 
intellectuals, and the resultant exploitation of German labour under the yoke of 
Jewish international finance, is only the overture to the movement for 
expanding Jewish power ona wider scale and finally subjugating the world to 
its rule. 


As has so often happened in the course of history, Germany is the chief 
pivot of this formidable struggle. If our people and our State fall victims to 
these oppressors of the nations, who lust after blood and gold, the whole earth 
will become the prey of that hydra-headed monster. 


If Germany succeeds in freeing herself, from its grip, this great menace 
to the nations of the world will thereby be eliminated. 


702 


It is certain that Jewry will resort to every possible underhand device in 
order not only to keep alive the old anti-German feeling among other nations, 
but to intensify it if possible. 


It is no less certain that these activities are only very partially in keeping 
with the true interests of the nations among whom the poison is being spread. 


As a general principle, Jewry carries on its campaign in the various 
countries by the use of arguments that are best calculated to appeal to the 
mentality of the respective nations and are most likely to produce the desired 
results. 


Our nation has been so torn asunder racially that it is easy for Jewry in 
its fight for power to make use of the more or less ‘cosmopolitan’ and pacifist 
ideas, in short, the international tendencies, which are the result of this 
disruption. In France, the Jews exploit the well-known and accurately 
estimated chauvinistic spirit. In England, they exploit the commercial and 
world political outlook. In short, they always work upon the essential 
characteristics peculiar to the mentality of each nation. 


When they have by this means achieved a decisive influence in the 
political and economic spheres, they can drop the pretence which their former 
tactics necessitated, now disclosing their real intentions and the ends for which 
they are fighting. 


Their work of destruction now goes ahead more quickly, reducing one 
State after another to a mass of ruins on which they will erect the everlasting 
and sovereign Jewish Empire. 


In England, and also in Italy, the contrast between the better kind of 
native statesmanship and the policy of the Jewish financiers often becomes 
strikingly evident. 


Only in France does there exist to-day, in a greater degree than ever 
before, a profound harmony between the aims of the Stock Exchange, of the 
Jews who control it and those of a chauvinistic national policy. 


This identity of purpose constitutes an immense danger for Germany and 
it is for this very reason that France 1s, and will remain, by far her most 
dangerous enemy. 


The French nation, which is becoming more and more polluted by Negro 


703 


blood, represents a menace to the existence of the white race in Europe, 
because it is bound up with the Jewish campaign for world domination. 


The contamination caused by the influx of Negroid blood on the Rhine, in 
the very heart of Europe, is in accord with the sadistic and perverse lust for 
vengeance on the part of the hereditary enemy of our people. 


This suits the purpose of the cool, calculating Jew, who would use this 
means of beginning a process of bastardisation in the very centre of the 
European continent and, by infecting the white race with the blood of an 
inferior stock, destroy the foundations of its independent existence. 


France’s activities in Europe to-day, spurred on by the French lust for 
vengeance and systematically directed by the Jew, are a criminal attack upon 
the existence of the white races and will one day arouse against the French 
people a spirit of vengeance among a generation which will recognise racial 
pollution as the original sin of mankind. 


As far as Germany is concerned, the danger which France represents, 
makes it her duty to relegate all sentiment to a subordinate plane and to extend 
a hand to those who are threatened with the same menace and who are not 
willing to suffer or tolerate France’s lust for hegemony. 


For a long time to come there will be only two Powers in Europe with 
which it may be possible for Germany to conclude an alliance. These Powers 
are Great Britain and Italy. 


If we take the trouble to review the way in which German foreign policy 
has been conducted since the Revolution we must, in view of the constant and 
incomprehensible failure of our governments, either lose heart or be overcome 
with rage and take up the cudgels against such a regime. 


Their way of acting cannot be attributed to a want of understanding, 
because what seemed to every thinking man to be inconceivable was 
accomplished by the leaders of the November parties, with their Cyclopean 
intellects. 


They wooed France and begged her favour. Indeed, throughout these past 
years, they have, with the touching simplicity of incorrigible visionaries, gone 
on their knees to France again and again, they have grovelled before the 
Grande Nation, and thought they recognised in each successive wily trick 
performed by the French hangmen the first signs of a change of feeling. 


704 


Our real political wire-pullers never shared this absurd credulity. The 
idea of establishing a friendship with France was for them only a means of 
thwarting every attempt on Germany’s part to adopt a practical policy of 
alliances. 


They had no illusions about French aims or those of the men behind the 
scenes in France. What induced them to take up such an attitude and to act as if 
they honestly believed that the fate of Germany could possibly be changed in 
this way, was the cool calculation that otherwise our people might take the 
reins into their own hands and choose another road. 


Of course, it is difficult for us, even within the framework of our own 
Movement, to propose Britain as our possible ally in the future. 


Our Jewish press has been adept in concentrating hatred against Britain, 
in particular, and many of our good German simpletons perched on the 
branches which the Jews had lined to fool them. 


They babbled about a restoration of German sea-power and protested 
against the robbery of our colonies. Thus they furnished material which the 
contriving Jew transmitted to his clansmen in England, to be used there for 
purposes of practical propaganda. 


It is high time that even our easily duped bourgeoisie, which loves to 
dabble in politics, realised that to-day we have not to fight for ‘sea-power’ and 
the like. 


Even before the War it was absurd to direct the national energies of 
Germany towards this end without first having secured our position in Europe. 


Such an aspiration today reaches that peak of absurdity which may be 
called criminal in the domain of politics. 


The success of the Jewish wire-pullers in concentrating the attention of 
the people on things which are only of secondary importance to-day was often 
calculated to, drive one to despair. 


They incited the people to demonstrations and protests while at the same 
time France was tearing our nation asunder bit by bit and systematically 
removing the very foundations of our national independence. 


In this connection I have in mind one particular bone of contention of 


705 


which the Jew has made extraordinarily skilful use in recent years, namely, 
South Tyrol. 


The reason why I take up this question here is that I want to call to 
account that shameless canaille, who, relying on the ignorance and short 
memory of a large section of our people, simulate a national indignation which 
is as foreign to the real character of our parliamentary imposters as the idea of 
respect for private property is to a jackdaw. 


I should like to state here that I was one of those who, at the time when 
the fate of South Tyrol was being decided—that is to say, from August 1914 to 
November 1918—took their place where that country could be most 
effectively defended, namely, in the Army. 


I did my share of the fighting during those years, not merely to save South 
Tyrol from being lost, but also to save every other German province for the 
Fatherland. The parliamentary highwaymen, the whole gang of party 
politicians, did not take part in that combat. On the contrary, while we carried 
on the fight in the belief that a victorious issue to the War would enable the 
German nation to keep South Tyrol, along with other frontier provinces, these 
traitors carried on a seditious agitation against such a victorious issue, until the 
fighting Siegfried succumbed to the dagger-thrust in his back. 


The inflammatory and hypocritical speeches of the elegantly dressed 
parliamentarians in the Vienna Rathaus Plat or in front of the Feldherrnhalle in 
Munich could not save South Tyrol for Germany. 


That could have been done only by the battalions fighting at the front. 
Those who broke up that fighting front betrayed South Tyrol, together with all 
the other provinces of Germany. 


Anyone who thinks that the South Tyrolean question can be solved to-day 
by protests, declarations and processions organised by various associations, is 
either a humbug or merely a German Philistine. 


It must be quite clearly understood that we shall not get back the 
territories we have lost if we depend on solemn prayers addressed to Almighty 
God or on pious faith in a League of Nations, but only by the force of arms. 


The only question is, therefore: Who is ready to take up arms for the 
restoration of the lost territories? 


706 


As far as I myself am concerned, I can state with a good conscience, that 
I would have courage enough to take part in a campaign for the reconquest of 
South Tyrol, at the head of parliamentarian storm battalions consisting of 
parliamentary gasconaders, other party leaders and various Councillors of 
State. 


How I should enjoy seeing the shrapnel burst above the heads of those 
taking part in an ‘enthusiastic’ protest demonstration! 


I think that if a fox were to break into a poultry-yard his presence would 
not provoke such a helter-skelter and rush for cover as we should witness in 
the case of such a fine assembly of ‘protesters.’ 


The vilest part of it all is, that these talkers themselves do not believe 
that anything can be achieved in this way. Each one of them knows very well 
how harmless and ineffectual their whole play-acting is. 


They do it only because it is easier to babble about the restoration of 
South Tyrol now, than it was to fight for its preservation in days gone by. 


Each one plays the part that he is best suited to play in life. In those days 
we sacrificed our lives. To-day these people are engaged in shouting 
themselves hoarse. 


It is particularly interesting to note to-day how Legitimist circles in 
Vienna preen themselves on their work for the restoration of South Tyrol. 


Seven years ago their august and illustrious dynasty helped, by an act of 
perjury and treason, to make it possible for the victorious world-coalition to 
take away South Tyrol. 


At that time these circles supported the perfidious policy adopted by 
their dynasty and did not trouble themselves in the least about the fate of South 
Tyrol or any other province. 


Naturally, it is easier to-day to take up the fight for this territory, since 
the present struggle 1s waged with ‘the weapons of the mind.’ 


Anyhow it is easier to join in a ‘meeting of protest’ and talk yourself 
hoarse in giving vent to the righteous indignation that fills your breast, or stain 
your finger with the writing of a newspaper article, than to blow up a bridge, 
for instance, during the occupation of the Ruhr. 


707 


The reason why certain circles have made the question of South Tyrol the 
pivot of German-Italian relations during the past few years is quite evident. 


Jews and Habsburg Legitimists are greatly interested in preventing 
Germany from pursuing a policy of alliance which might one day lead to the 
resurgence of a free German Fatherland. 


It is not out of love for South Tyrol that they play this role to-day—for 
their policy would turn out detrimental rather than helpful to the interests of 
that province—but through fear of an agreement being established between 
Germany and Italy. 


A tendency towards lying and calumny is inborn in these people, and that 
explains how they can calmly and brazenly attempt to twist things in such a 
way as to make it appear that we have ‘betrayed’ South Tyrol. 


One thing must be made clear to these gentlemen, namely, that South 
Tyrol was betrayed, in the first place, by every German who was sound in 
wind and limb and was not at the front during the years 1914—1918 to do his 
duty to his country. In the second place, South Tyrol was betrayed by every 
man who, during those years, did not help to reinforce the national spirit and 
the national powers of resistance, so as to enable the country to carry on the 
war and keep up the fight to the very end. 


In the third place, South Tyrol was betrayed by everyone who took part 
in the November Revolution, either directly by co-operation, or indirectly by a 
cowardly toleration of it, and thus destroyed the sole weapon that could have 
saved South Tyrol. 


In the fourth place, South Tyrol was betrayed by those parties and their 
adherents who put their signatures to the disgraceful treaties of Versailles and 
St. Germain. 


Thus the matter stands, my brave gentlemen, who make your protests 
only in words. 


To-day I am guided by a calm and cool recognition of the fact that the 
lost territories cannot be won back by the glib tongues of parliamentary 
speechifiers, but only by the whetted sword; in other words, through a fight in 
which blood will be shed. 


I have, therefore, no hesitation in saying that now the die is cast, it is 


708 


impossible to win back South Tyrol through a war. In fact, I would definitely 
take my stand against such a move, because I am convinced that it would not be 
possible to arouse the national enthusiasm of the German people to the pitch 
necessary to carry such a war to a successful issue. 


On the contrary, I believe that if we have to shed German blood once 
again it would be criminal to do so for the sake of liberating two hundred 
thousand Germans, when close at hand more than seven million Germans are 
suffering under a foreign yoke, while a life-line of the German nation has 
become a playground for hordes of African Negroes. 


If the German nation 1s to put an end to a state of things which threatens 
to wipe it off the map of Europe, it must not fall into the error of the pre-war 
period and make the whole world its enemy. 


It must ascertain who is its most dangerous enemy, so that it can 
concentrate all its forces in a struggle to rout him, and if, in order to gain the 
victory in this struggle, sacrifices have to be made elsewhere, future 
generations will not condemn us on that account. 


The more brilliant the resulting victory, the better will they be able to 
appreciate the dice necessity and the deep anxiety which led us to make that 
bitter decision. 


We must always be guided by the fundamental principle that, as a 
preliminary to winning back lost provinces, the political independence and 
strength of the mother-country must first be restored. 


The first task which a strong government must accomplish in the sphere 
of foreign politics is to make that independence possible and to secure it by a 
wise policy of alliances, but it is just on this point that we National Socialists 
have to guard against being dragged along in tow by our ranting bourgeois 
patriots who take their cue from the Jew. 


It would be a disaster if, instead of preparing for the coming struggle, 
our Movement, too, were to content itself with mere protests by word of 
mouth. 


It was the fantastic idea of a Nibelungen alliance with the rotting body of 
the Habsburg State that brought about Germany’s ruin. 


Fantastic sentimentality in dealing with the possibilities arising in the 


709 


field of foreign politics to-day would be the best means of preventing our 
revival for innumerable years to come. 


Here I must briefly answer the objections which may be raised in 
connection with the three questions I have put. 


1. Is it possible to form an alliance with present-day Germany whose 
weakness is obvious to all? 


2. Can the enemy nations change their attitude towards Germany? 


3. Is not the influence of Jewry stronger than the recognition of facts, and 
does not this influence thwart all good intentions and render all plans futile? 


I think that I have already dealt adequately with one aspect of the first 
question. 


Of course nobody will enter into an alliance with present-day Germany. 
No Power in the world would link its fortunes with those of a State whose 
government does not afford grounds for the slightest confidence. 


I strongly object to the attempt which has been made by many of our 
compatriots to explain and excuse the conduct of the government by referring to 
the woeful state of public feeling. 


The lack of character which our people have shown during the last six 
years is indeed deeply distressing. The indifference with which they have 
treated the crying needs of our nation is depressing in the extreme and their 
cowardice is often revolting, but one must never forget that we are dealing 
with a people who gave the world, a few years previously, an admirable 
example of the highest human qualities. 


From the first days of August 1914 to the end of the tremendous struggle 
between the nations, no people in the world gave a better proof of manly 
courage, tenacity and patient endurance, than this people which is so cast down 
and dispirited to-day. 


Nobody dare assert that our humiliating position to-day is in keeping 
with the true character of our nation. What we have to endure to-day, 
physically and spiritually, is due only to the appalling, soul destroying 
influence of the act of high treason committed on November 9th, 1918. 


More than ever before the poet is right when he says that evil must 


710 


inevitably continue to breed evil. But even to-day, the fundamentally sound 
qualities of our nation are not dead, they are only dormant in the depths of the 
national conscience, and sometimes in the clouded firmament we see the gleam 
of qualities which Germany will one day remember as the first symptoms of a 
revival. 


More than once thousands of young Germans have rallied to a call, 
resolved, as in 1914, freely and willingly to offer themselves as a sacrifice on 
the altar of their beloved Fatherland. 


Millions of men have resumed work, whole-heartedly and zealously, as 
if no revolution had ever affected them. The smith is at his anvil once again, 
the farmer is driving his plough and the scientist is in his laboratory—all doing 
their duty, with the same zeal and devotion as formerly. 


The oppression which we suffer at the hands of our enemies is no longer 
accepted, as formerly, with a laugh and a shrug, but is resented with bitterness 
and anger. 


There can be no doubt that a great change of attitude has taken place. 


This change has not yet taken the shape of a conscious intention and urge 
to restore the political power and independence of our nation, but the blame 
for this must be attributed to those who, less in response to a heaven-sent call 
than in order to satisfy their own ambition, have been governing our nation 
since 1918 and leading it to ruin. 


If any man seeks to sit in judgment upon our nation to-day he must ask 
himself, ‘What has been done to help it?’ 


Was the poor support which the nation gave the resolutions passed by 
our governments (which were of a shadowy nature) a sign of our nation’s lack 
of vitality or was it not rather a sign of the complete failure of the methods 
employed in administering this valuable trust? 


What have our governments done to reawaken in this nation a spirit of 
proud self-assertion, courageous defiance and righteous hatred? 


In 1919, when the Peace Treaty was imposed on the German nation, 
these were grounds for hoping that this instrument of unrestricted oppression 
would help to reinforce the outcry for the freedom of Germany. 


711 


Peace treaties which make demands that fall like a whip-lash on the 
people turn out not infrequently to be the signal for a future revival. 


How could the Treaty of Versailles have been exploited! 


How, in the hands of a willing government, could this instrument of 
unlimited blackmail and shameful humiliation have been applied for the 
purpose of rousing national sentiment to fever-pitch! 


How could a well-directed system of propaganda have utilised the 
sadistic cruelty of that treaty in order to change the indifference of the people 
into a feeling of indignation and transform that indignation into a spirit of 
dauntless resistance! 


Every clause of that treaty should have been branded upon the hearts and 
minds of the German people until, in the souls of sixty million men and women, 
a common sense of shame and a hatred shared in common burst into flame like 
a torrent of fire, in the heat of which were forged an inflexible resolve and the 
cry, ‘We must have arms!’ 


A treaty of that kind can be used for such a purpose. Its unbounded 
oppression and its impudent demands were an excellent propaganda weapon to 
arouse the sluggish spirit of the nation and restore its vitality. 


Then, every type of reading-matter from the child’s story-book to the last 
newspaper in the country, every theatre and cinema, every pillar where 
placards are posted and every free space on the hoardings should be utilised in 
the service of this one great mission; until the faint-hearted cry of ‘Lord, 
deliver us,’ which our patriotic associations send up to Heaven to-day was 
transformed, even in the mind of the smallest child, into the ardent prayer, 
‘Almighty God, bless our arms when the hour comes. Be just, as Thou hast 
always been just. Judge now if we deserve our freedom. Lord, bless our 
struggle.’ 


All opportunities were neglected and nothing was done. Who can be 
surprised if our people are not such as they should be or might be, when the 
rest of the world looks upon us only as its valet, or as an obedient dog that will 
lick his master’s hand after he has been whipped. 


Of course the possibility of forming alliances with other nations is 
hampered by the indifference of our own people, but much more by our 
government. Their corrupting influence is to blame for the fact that now, after 


712 


eight years of indescribable oppression, there exists only a faint desire for 
liberty. 


Before our nation can embark upon a policy of alliances, it must restore 
its prestige among other nations, and it must have an authoritative government 
that 1s not a drudge in the service of foreign States and the taskmaster of its 
own people, but rather the herald of the national will. 


If our people had a government which looked upon this as its mission, a 
courageous foreign policy pursued by the Reich government would, before six 
years had elapsed, enjoy the equally courageous support of a people yearning 
for freedom. 


The second objection referred to the difficulty of changing ex-enemy 
nations into friendly allies. That objection may be answered as follows: The 
general anti-German psychosis which has developed in other countries through 
war-propaganda must of necessity continue to exist as long as there 1s no 
renascence of the national instinct of self-preservation among the German 
people. 


The appearance of such an instinct will transform the German Reich 
once more into a State able to play its part on the chess-board of European 
politics and one which the others regard as a worthy partner. Only when the 
government and the people give evidence of their fitness to enter into an 
alliance will some Power, whose interests coincide with ours, set about 
instituting a system of propaganda for the purpose of changing public opinion 
among its own people. 


Naturally, it will take several years of persevering and ably directed 
work to achieve such a result. 


Just because a long period is needed in order to change the public 
opinion of a country, it is necessary to reflect calmly before such an enterprise 
be undertaken. 


This means that one must not enter upon this kind of work unless one is 
absolutely convinced that it is worth the trouble and that it will bring results 
which will bear good fruit in the future. 


One must not try to change the opinions and feelings of a people by 
basing one’s actions on the vain cajolery of a more or less brilliant Foreign 
Minister, but only if there be a tangible guarantee that the new orientation will 


713 


be really useful. Otherwise, public opinion in the country concerned would be 
plunged into a state of complete confusion. 


The most reliable guarantee that can be given for the possibility of 
subsequently entering into an alliance with a certain State is not to be found in 
the loquacious suavity of some individual member of the government, but in the 
manifest stability of a definite and practical policy on the part of the 
government as a whole, and in public opinion which is solidly of the same 
mind. 


Universal faith in this policy will be strengthened in the same measure in 
which the government give tangible evidence of their activity through the 
medium of preparatory and supporting propaganda and in the measure in which 
the trend of public opinion is reflected in the government’s policy. 


Therefore, a nation in such a position as ours will be looked upon as a 
possible ally only when public opinion and the government are united in the 
same enthusiastic and openly avowed determination to carry through the fight 
for national freedom. 


That condition of affairs must be firmly established before any attempt 
can be made to change public opinion in other countries which, for the sake of 
defending their own interests, are disposed to take the road shoulder-to- 
shoulder with a companion who seems able to play his part in defending those 
interests—in other words, they are ready to establish an alliance. 


For this purpose, however, one thing is necessary. Seeing that the task of 
bringing about a radical change in the public opinion of a country calls for hard 
work—and many will at first not understand what that means—it would be 
both foolish and criminal to commit mistakes which could be used as weapons 
in the hands of those who are opposed to such a change. 


One must recognise the fact that it takes a long time for a people to 
understand completely the inner purposes which a government has in view, 
because it is not possible to explain the ultimate aims of the preliminary steps 
undertaken with a view to pursuing a certain policy. 


The government has to count on the blind faith of the masses or the 
intuitive instinct of the more intellectually developed ruling caste—but since 
many people lack this insight and political acumen, and since political 
considerations forbid a public explanation of why such and such a course is 


714 


being followed—a certain number of leaders in intellectual circles will 
always oppose new tendencies which, because they are not easily grasped, can 
easily be regarded in the light of mere experiments. 


It is in this way that the opposition of over-anxious conservative circles 
is aroused. 


For this reason it is our bounden duty not to allow any weapon to fall 
into the hands of those who would interfere with the work of bringing about a 
mutual understanding with other nations. 


This is especially so when, as in our case, we have to deal with the 
pretensions and unpractical talk of our patriotic associations and our small 
bourgeoisie who air their political opinions in the cafés. 


That the cry for a new navy, the restoration of our colonies, etc., is just 
silly talk which is not based on any plan for its practical execution, cannot be 
denied by anyone who thinks over the matter calmly and seriously. 


At the same time the manner in which Britain exploits the foolish tirades 
of these champions of the policy of protest who are in reality playing into the 
hands of our mortal enemies cannot be considered advantageous to Germany. 


These people dissipate their energies in futile demonstrations against 
everything and everybody which is harmful to our interests and those who 
indulge in them forget the fundamental principle which is a preliminary 
condition of all success, namely, that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing 
well. 


Because they keep on grumbling against five or ten States, they fail to 
concentrate all the forces of our national will and our physical strength for a 
blow at the heart of our most bitter enemy and in this way they sacrifice the 
possibility of securing an alliance which would reinforce our strength for that 
decisive conflict. 


Here, too, there is a mission for National Socialism to fulfil. It must 
teach our people not to fix their attention on the little things, but rather on major 
issues, not to exhaust their energies on questions of secondary importance and 
not to forget that the object for which we have to fight to-day is the bare 
existence of our people and that the sole enemy at whom we must strike, is the 
Power which is robbing us of that existence. 


q15 


It may be that we shall have to swallow many a bitter pill, but this is by 
no means an excuse for refusing to listen to reason or for raising a stupid and 
useless outcry against the rest of the world, instead of concentrating all our 
forces against our most deadly enemy. 


Moreover, the German people will have no moral right to complain of 
the manner in which the rest of the world acts towards them, as long as they 
themselves have not called to account those criminals who sold and betrayed 
their country. 


We are not acting sincerely if we indulge in long-range abuse and 
protests against Britain and Italy and then allow those scoundrels to go scot- 
free, who, acting in the pay of the enemy, wrested the weapons out of our 
hands, broke the backbone of our resistance and bartered away the paralysed 
Reich for thirty pieces of silver. 


Our enemies are acting in the only way in which they could be expected 
to act, and we ought to learn a lesson from their behaviour. 


Anyone who cannot rise to the level of this outlook must reflect that 
otherwise there would be nothing for us to do except to resign ourselves to our 
lot, since a policy of alliances would be impossible for all time. For if we 
cannot form an alliance with Britain because she has robbed us of our 
colonies, or with Italy because she has taken possession of South Tyrol, or 
with Poland or Czechoslovakia, then there remains no other possibility of an 
alliance in Europe except with France which, inter alia, has robbed us of 
Alsace and Lorraine. 


There can scarcely be any doubt as to whether this last alternative would 
be advantageous to the German people; the only matter for doubt is whether he 
who upholds such opinions is merely a simpleton or an astute rogue. 


As far as the leaders are concerned, I think the latter hypothesis is true. 


A change in public feeling among those nations which have hitherto been 
enemies and whose true interests will, in the future, coincide with ours could 
be effected, as far as one can foresee, if the internal strength of our State and 
our manifest determination to secure our own existence made it clear that we 
should prove valuable allies. 


Moreover, it is essential that incompetence or even criminal bungling 
should not furnish grounds which may be utilised for purposes of propaganda 


716 


by those who would oppose our projects for establishing an alliance with one 
or other of our former enemies. 


The answer to the third question is the most difficult. Is it conceivable 
that those who represent the true interests of those nations which may possibly 
form an alliance with us could put their views into practice against the will of 
the Jew, who is the mortal enemy of national and independent States? 


For instance, could the motive forces of Great Britain’s traditional 
statesmanship smash the disastrous influence of the Jew, or could they not? 


This question, as I have already said, is very difficult to answer. The 
answer depends on so many factors that it is impossible to form a conclusive 
judgment. One thing, at least, 1s certain: There is, at the present time, one State 
in which the regime is so firmly established and so absolutely at the service of 
the country’s interests that the forces of international Jewry could not possibly 
organise a real and effective obstruction of measures considered to be 
politically necessary. 


The fight which Fascist Italy waged against Jewry’s three principal 
weapons, even if it be to a great extent subconscious (though I do not believe 
this myself), furnishes the best proof that the poison-fangs of that power which 
transcends all State boundaries are being drawn, even though in an indirect 
way. 


The prohibition of freemasonry and secret societies, the suppression of 
the international press and the definite abolition of Marxism, together with the 
steadily increasing consolidation of the Fascist concept of the State—all this 
will enable the Italian Government, in the course of years, to advance more 
and more the interests of the Italian people without paying any attention to the 
hissing of the Jewish world-hydra. 


The situation in Britain is not so favourable. In that country of ‘freest 
democracy’ it is the Jew who, even to-day, can impose his will practically 
without let or hindrance, through his hold on public opinion. 


And yet there is a perpetual struggle in Britain between those who are 
entrusted with the defence of state interests and the protagonists of Jewish 
world-dictatorship. 


To what extent these two tendencies run counter to one another became 
obvious for the first time when, after the War, British statesmen adopted one 


FLT 


attitude with regard to the Japanese problem, while the press took up a 
different one. 


Immediately after the cessation of hostilities, the old mutual antipathy 
between America and Japan began to reappear. 


Naturally, the great European Powers could not remain indifferent to this 
new war menace. In Britain, despite the ties of kinship, there was a certain 
amount of jealousy and anxiety over the growing importance of the United 
States in all spheres of international economics and politics. 


What was formerly a colonial territory, the daughter of a great mother, 
seemed about to become the new mistress of the world. 


It is quite understandable that to-day Britain should re-examine her old 
alliances and that British statesmen should look anxiously ahead to a day when 
the cry will no longer be, ‘Britannia rules the waves’, but rather, ‘The seas 
belong to the United States.’ 


The gigantic North American State, with the enormous resources of its 
virgin soil, is much more invulnerable than the encircled German Reich. 


Should a day come when the fate of the nations will have to be decided, 
Britain would be doomed, if she stood alone. Therefore she eagerly reaches 
out her hand to a yellow race and enters upon an alliance which, from the 
racial point of view is perhaps unpardonable; but from the political standpoint 
it represents the sole possibility of reinforcing Britain’s world position in face 
of the tremendous developments taking place on the American continent. 


Thus, despite the fact that Britain and America fought side by side on the 
battlefields of Europe, the British Government could not decide to break off 
the alliance with their Asiatic partner, yet the whole Jewish press opposed the 
idea of a Japanese alliance. 


How can we explain the fact that up to 1918, the Jewish press 
championed the policy of the British Government against the German Reich 
and then suddenly veered round and began to go its own way. 


It was not in the interests of Great Britain to have Germany annihilated, 
but primarily a Jewish interest, and to-day the destruction of Japan would 
serve British political interests less than it would serve the far-reaching 
intentions of those who are leading the movement that hopes to establish a 


718 


Jewish world-empire. 


While Britain is making every effort to maintain her position in the 
world, the Jew is laying his plans for its conquest. He already sees the present 
European States as pliant instruments in his hands, whether indirectly through 
the power of so-called Western Democracy or in the form of direct domination 
through Russian Bolshevism. 


But it is not only the Old World that he holds in his snare; alike fate 
threatens the New World. Jews control the financial forces of America on the 
Stock Exchange. 


Year after year the Jew increases his hold on labour in a nation of one 
hundred and twenty million souls, but a very small section still remains quite 
independent and is thus a cause of chagrin to the Jew. 


The Jews show consummate skill in manipulating public opinion and 
forge from it a weapon to be wielded in the struggle for their own future. 


The great leaders of Jewry are confident that the day 1s near at hand 
when the promise given in the Old Testament will be fulfilled and the Jews 
will rule the other nations of the earth. 


Among this great mass of de-nationalised countries which have become 
Jewish colonies one independent State could bring about the ruin of the whole 
structure at the last moment, the reason being that Bolshevism as a world- 
system cannot continue to exist unless it encompasses the whole earth. 


Should one State alone preserve its national strength and its national 
greatness the empire of the Jewish satraps, like every other form of tyranny, 
would succumb to the force of the national idea. 


As a result of his millennial experience in accommodating himself to 
surrounding circumstances, the Jew knows very well that he can undermine the 
existence of European nations by a process of racial bastardisation, but that he 
could hardly do the same to an Asiatic national State like Japan. 


To-day he can ape the ways of the German and the Englishman, the 
American and the Frenchman, but he has no means of approach to the yellow 
Asiatic. 


Therefore, he seeks to destroy the Japanese national State by using other 


719 


national States as his instruments, so that he may rid himself of a dangerous 
opponent before he takes over supreme control of the last existing national 
State and transforms that control into a tyranny for the oppression of the 
defenceless. 


He does not want to have a national Japanese State in existence when he 
founds his millennial Jewish empire of the future and therefore he wants to 
destroy the former before establishing his own dictatorship. 


That is why he is busy to-day stirring up antipathy towards Japan among 
the other nations, as he once stirred it up against Germany. 


Thus it may happen that even while British statesmanship is still 
endeavouring to base its policy on an alliance with Japan, the Anglo-Jewish 
press is clamouring for war against the prospective ally and, to the 
accompaniment of the slogans, ‘Democracy!’ and ‘Down with Japanese 
militarism and imperialism!’ actually preparing for a way of annihilation. 


Thus, in Britain to-day the Jew is becoming refractory and so the 
struggle against the Jewish world-menace is bound to commence there, too. 


In this field, too, the National Socialist Movement has a tremendous task 
before it. It must open the eyes of our people in regard to foreign nations and it 
must continually remind them of the real enemy who menaces the world to-day. 


Instead of preaching hatred against Aryans from whom we may be 
separated on almost every other count, but with whom the bond of kindred 
blood and the main features of a common civilisation unite us, we must arouse 
general indignation against the malevolent enemy of humanity and the real 
author of all our sufferings. 


The National Socialist Movement must see to it that at least in our own 
country the mortal enemy is recognised and that the fight against him may be the 
beacon-light of a happier era, and show other nations, too, the way of salvation 
for struggling Aryan humanity. 


Moreover, may reason be our guide and our strength be in our 
indomitable will. May the sacred duty of acting thus grant us perseverance and 
our faith prove our supreme protection.

722 


CHAPTER XIV: EASTERN BIAS OR EASTERN 
POLICY 


There are two considerations which induce me to make a special 
analysis of Germany’s attitude towards Russia. 


These are, that firstly, this may prove to be the most important problem 
which German foreign policy has to solve, and secondly; this problem is, at the 
same time, the touchstone which will test the political capacity of the young 
National Socialist Movement for clear thinking and adopting the right course of 
action. 


I must confess that the second consideration has often been a source of 
great anxiety to me. The members of our Movement are not recruited from 
circles which are habitually indifferent to public affairs, but mostly from 
among men who hold more or less extreme views. 


Such being the case, it is only natural that their understanding of foreign 
politics should at first labour under the prejudices and inadequate knowledge 
of those circles to which they formerly belonged by virtue of their political and 
ideological opinions. 


This is true not only of the men who come to us from the Left. On the 
contrary, however harmful may have been the kind of teaching they formerly 
received in regard to these problems, in very many cases this was, in part, at 
least, counterbalanced by the sound and natural instincts which they retained. 


In such cases it is only necessary to substitute a better teaching in place 
of the earlier influences, in order to transform the instinct of self-preservation 
and other sound instinct into valuable assets. 


On the other hand, it is much more difficult to train a man to see clearly 
in political matters, if his previous education in this field was no less devoid 
of sense and logic, but if, in addition, he has sacrificed the last residue of his 
natural instincts on the altar of objective thinking. 


It is particularly difficult to induce such representatives of our so-called 
intellectual circles to adopt a realistic and logical attitude in protecting their 
own interests and the interests of their nation in its relations with foreign 
countries. 


723 


Their minds are overladen with a large burden of prejudices and absurd 
ideas and, as if this were not enough, they have lost or renounced every instinct 
of self-preservation. Against these men the National Socialist Movement has to 
fight a hard battle, too, and the struggle is all the harder because, though very 
often they are utterly incompetent, they are so self-conceited that, without the 
slightest justification, they even look, down on others whose opinions are more 
sound. 


These arrogant snobs, who pretend to know better than other people, are 
wholly incapable of calmly and coolly analysing a problem land of weighing 
the pros and cons, which is the necessary preliminary to any decision or action 
taken in the field of foreign politics. 


Since these particular circles are, at present, beginning to deflect our 
foreign policy in the most disastrous way from protecting the real interests of 
our people, in order to serve their own fantastic ideologies, I feel it incumbent 
upon me to give my own followers a clear exposition of the most important 
problem in our foreign policy, namely, our relations with Russia. 


I shall deal with it as thoroughly as may be necessary to make it 
generally understood and as far as the limits of this book permit. 


Let me begin by making the following general remarks. 


If, by foreign policy, we mean the establishment of relations between any 
nation and the other nations on this earth, we must admit that the establishment 
of such relations must depend on certain definite facts. 


Moreover, we, as National Socialists, must lay down the following 
principle as regards the essential characteristics of the foreign policy pursued 
by a volkisch State. 


The first object of the foreign policy of a volkisch State is to safeguard 
the existence on this earth of the race which has been organised as an entity by 
this State, by the establishment of a healthy, enduring and natural proportion 
between the size and the growth of the population, on the one hand, and the 
area and resources of its territory, on the other. 


The only proportion which can be termed ‘healthy’ is one in which the 
resources of the soil are sufficient, to guarantee the nation’s food-supply. 


Any condition which falls short of this is none the less unhealthy for the 


724 


fact that it may endure for centuries or even thousands of years. 


Sooner or later, this lack of proportion must of necessity lead to the 
decline; or even annihilation of the people concerned. Only a sufficiently large 
space on this earth can assure the independent existence of a people. 


The extent of the territory necessary for the accommodation of the 
national population must not be estimated in the light of present exigencies or 
even of its agricultural productivity in relation to the number of the population. 


In the first volume of this book, under the heading, ‘Germany’s Policy of 
Alliances before the War’, I have already explained that the territorial 
dimensions of a State are of importance not only as the immediate source of the 
nation’s food-supply, but also from the military standpoint. 


Once a people have become self-supporting as a result of the adequate 
area of its territory, the next consideration is how to take the necessary steps to 
safeguard his territory. 


National security depends on the political and military strength of a State 
and this, in turn, depends on its geographical situation looked at from the 
military point of view. 


Thus the German nation could assure its own future only by becoming a 
World Power. For nearly two thousand years the defence of our national 
interests (as we ought to describe our more or less successful foreign political 
activities) was a matter of world history. 


We ourselves have witnessed this, since the gigantic international 
struggle of the German people for their existence on this earth, and it was 
carried out in such a way that it has become known in the annals of history as 
the World War. 


When Germany entered this struggle it was presumed that she was a 
World Power. 


I say ‘presumed’ because in reality she was no such thing. If, in 1914, 
there had been a different proportion between the German population and its 
territorial area, Germany would really have been a World Power and, leaving 
other factors out of count, the War would have ended in her favour. 


It is neither my task nor my intention here to discuss what would have 


725 


happened if certain conditions had been fulfilled, but I feel it absolutely 

incumbent on me to depict the present situation in its true light, and to point out 
its weaknesses which give cause for alarm, in order to make at least those who 
belong to the National Socialist Movement aware of what steps must be taken. 


Germany is not a World Power to-day. Even though our present military 
weakness could be overcome, we would still have no claim to be called a 
World Power. 


What importance has any State on earth in which the proportion between 
the size of the population and the territorial area is so hopelessly unsatisfactory 
as in the present German Reich? 


In an epoch in which the world is being gradually portioned out among 
States, many of whom embrace almost whole continents, one cannot speak of a 
World Power in referring to a State whose political mother-country is limited 
to a territorial area of barely five-hundred-thousand square kilometres. 


Looked at purely from the territorial point of view, the area of the 
German Reich is insignificant in comparison with that of so-called World 
Powers. 


It would be wrong to cite the case of Britain for the purpose of 
disproving this statement, because Great Britain, the mother-country, is in 
reality the great metropolis of the British World Empire, which covers almost 
one-fourth of the earth’s surface. Among the giant States we must also consider 
the United States of America, Russia and China. These are enormous 
territories, some of which have more than ten times the area of the present 
German Reich. 


France must also be ranked among these States. Not only because she is 
constantly increasing the strength of her army by recruiting coloured troops 
from the population of her gigantic empire, but also because, from the racial 
point of view, she is rapidly becoming Negroid to such an extent that we can 
actually speak of the formation of an African state on European soil. 


The contemporary colonial policy of France cannot be compared with 
that of Germany in the past. If France develops along the lines it has taken in 
our day, and should that development continue for the next three hundred years, 
all traces of French blood will finally be lost in the formation of a Euro- 
African mulatto state. 


726 


This would represent a formidable and compact colonial territory 
stretching from the Rhine to the Congo, inhabited by an inferior race which had 
developed through a slow and steady process of bastardization. In this, French 
colonial policy differs from the policy followed by the old Germany. 


The former German colonial policy consisted in half measures as did 
almost everything undertaken at that time It did not aim at the acquisition of 
new territory for the settlement of German nationals nor did it make any 
attempt (criminal though this might have been) to reinforce the power of the 
Reich through the enlistment of black troops. 


The Askari units in German East Africa represented a small and hesitant 
step in this direction, but in reality they served only for the defence of the 
colony itself. 


The idea of transporting black troops to a European theatre of war— 
apart entirely from the practical impossibility of doing so during the World 
War—was never entertained as a proposal to be carried out under favourable 
conditions; whereas the French, on the contrary, always looked on this as the 
underlying motive and justification for their colonial activities. 


Thus we find in the world to-day a number of powerful States which are 
not only superior to Germany as regards the numerical strength of their 
population, but which also possess in territorial area the chief support of their 
political power. 


Never has the position of the German Reich, judged from the point of 
view of its area and the size of its population, been so unfavourable in 
comparison with other States of whilom importance, as at the beginning of its 
history two thousand years ago and again to-day. 


In that other era we were a young people and we stormed a world of 
decadent giant States, the last of which was Rome, to whose overthrow we 
contributed. To-day we find ourselves in a world of great and powerful States 
among which our own Reich is steadily losing in significance. We must always 
face this bitter truth with clear and calm minds. We must study the area and 
population of the German Reich in relation to the other States and compare 
them throughout the centuries. 


Then, I know, everyone will realise to his consternation that what I said 
at the outset is true, namely, that Germany is no longer a World Power, whether 


27 


she be strong or weak from the military point of view. 


There is no comparison between our position and that of the other States 
throughout the world, and this is to be attributed to the ill-fated foreign policy 
pursued by our governments, to the fact that our foreign policy failed 
absolutely to pursue a definite aim with unswerving perseverance and also to 
the fact that we have lost every sound impulse and instinct for self- 
preservation. 


If the National Socialist Movement is to be credited by posterity with 
having fulfilled a great mission on behalf of our nation it must fully recognise 
the serious nature of our actual position in the world, and struggle bravely and 
doggedly against the aimlessness and inefficiency which have hitherto led the 
German people to pursue a false course as regards foreign policy. 


Without respect for ‘tradition,’ and without any preconceived notions, the 
Movement must find the courage to organise our national forces, and set them 
on the path which will lead them beyond the confines of the ‘living space’ 
which is theirs to-day, to the acquisition of new territory. 


Thus the Movement will save the German people from the danger of 
perishing or of becoming slaves in the service of any other people. 


Our Movement must seek to abolish the present lack of proportion 
between our population and the area of our national territory, considered as the 
source of our maintenance or as a basis of political power. 


It ought also to strive to abolish the contrast between past history and the 
hopelessly powerless position in which we are to-day. 


In striving to do so, it must bear in mind the fact that we are the 
custodians of the highest form of civilisation on this earth, that we have a 
correspondingly high duty and that we shall fulfil this duty only if we inspire 
the German people with race-consciousness, so that they will concern 
themselves not merely with the breeding of dogs, horses and cats, but also care 
for the purity of their own blood. 


When I say that the foreign policy hitherto followed by Germany has 
been aimless and ineffectual, the proof of my statement will be found in the 
actual failure of this policy. 


Were our people intellectually backward, or did they lack courage, the 


728 


final results of their efforts could not have been worse than those of which we 
are witnesses to-day. We must not allow ourselves to be misled by 
developments during the last decades before the War, because we must not 
measure the strength of a State taken by itself, but in comparison with other 
States. 


Now, this comparison shows that not only had the strength of the other 
States increased more steadily than that of Germany, but that in the long run it 
proved to be greater, so that, despite her apparent prosperity, Germany 
gradually dropped further behind in the race with other States. 


In short, the difference in size increases much to our detriment. 


Even in the size of our population we lagged behind, and kept on losing 
ground. Since the courage of our people is unsurpassed by that of any other in 
the world and their sacrifice in defence of their existence greater than that of 
any other nation, their failure can be ascribed only to the false way in which 
this sacrifice was used. 


If, in this connection, we examine the chain of political vicissitudes 
through which our people have passed during more than a thousand years, 
recalling the innumerable struggles and wars and investigating the results as 
we have them before us to-day, we must confess that from the sea of blood only 
three phenomena have emerged which we can consider as the lasting fruits of a 
definite foreign policy, or, in fact of a policy at all. 


These were, firstly, the colonization of the Ostmark, which was mainly 
the work of the Bavarian secondly, the conquest and settlement of the territory 
east of the Elbe; and thirdly, the organisation of the Brandenburg-Prussian 
State, which was the work of the Hohenzollerns and which became the model 
for, and the nucleus of, a new Reich. An instructive lesson for the future! 


These first two great successes of our foreign policy turned out to be the 
most enduring. Without them our people would play no part in the world to- 
day. 


These achievements were the first, and unfortunately the only, successful 
attempts to establish a satisfactory balance between cur increasing population 
and the area of our country, and we must regard it as a fatal mistake that our 
German historians have never correctly appreciated these two outstanding 
achievements which were of such significance for the following generations. 


729 


On the other hand, they wrote panegyrics on many other things, on 
heroism displayed in the pursuit of a fantastic aim and on innumerable 
adventurous campaigns and wars, instead of realising that these latter had no 
significance in relation to the main course of our national development. 


The third great success achieved by our political activity was the 
establishment of the Prussian State and the development of a particular State 
concept which grew out of this. 


To the same source we must attribute the organisation of the instinct of 
national self-preservation and self-defence in the German Army, an 
achievement which suited the modem world. 


The transformation of the idea of self-defence on the part of the 
individual into the duty of national defence is derived from the Prussian State 
and the new State concept which it introduced. 


It would be impossible to over-estimate the importance of this process. 
The German nation, which, as a result of racial disintegration, had become the 
victim of exaggerated individualism, partially regained, through the 
disciplinary training of the Prussian Army, its capacity for organisation. 


What other nations still retain of the original herd instinct, we regained, 
in some measure, for the national community by the artificial means of military 
training. 


Consequently, the abolition of compulsory national military service— 
which may have no significance for dozens of other nations—had fatal 
consequences for us. 


Let ten generations of Germans be without the corrective and educative 
effect of military training and delivered over to the evil effects of their racial 
and, consequently, ideological disintegration and our people would lose the 
last relics of an independent existence on this earth. 


The German intellect could then make its contribution to civilisation only 
through the medium of individuals living under the rule of foreign nations and 
its origin would remain unknown, while acting as the fertilizing manure of 
civilisation, until the last residue of Nordic-Aryan blood in us had become 
corrupted or extinct. 


It is a remarkable fact that the real political successes achieved by our 


730 


people during their millennial struggles are better appreciated and understood 
by our adversaries than by ourselves. 


Even to-day we wax enthusiastic about an act of heroism which robbed 
our people of millions of their best racial stock and turned out completely 
fruitless in the end. 


The distinction between the real political successes which our people 
have achieved in the course of their long history and the futile aims for which 
the blood of the nation has been shed is of supreme importance in determining 
our policy now and in the future. 


We National Socialists must never allow ourselves to join in the huzza- 
ing patriotism of our contemporary bourgeois circles. 


It would be fatal for us to look upon the developments immediately 
before the War as in any way binding us in the choice of our own course. 


We can recognise no obligation devolving on us which may have its 
origin in any historical phase of the nineteenth century. 


In contradiction to the policy of those who represented that period, we 
must take our stand on the principles already mentioned in regard to foreign 
policy, namely, the necessity for bringing our territorial area into accord with 
the number of our population. 


From the past we can learn only one lesson, and this is that the aim 
which is to be pursued in our political conduct must be twofold, namely, (1) 
the acquisition of territory as the objective of our foreign policy and (2) the 
establishment of a new, uniform and ideologically secure foundation as the 
objective of our political activities at home. 


I shall deal briefly with the question of how far our territorial aims are 
justified according to ethical and moral principles. 


This is all the more necessary here because, in our so-called volkisch 
circles, there are all kinds of smooth-tongued phrase-mongers who try to 
persuade the German people that the great aim of their foreign policy ought to 
be to right the wrongs of 1918, while at the same time they consider it 
incumbent on them to assure the whole world of the brotherly spirit and 
sympathy of the German people. 


731 


In regard to this point I should like to make the following preliminary 
statement. To demand that the 1914 frontiers should be restored is a glaring 
political absurdity that is fraught with such consequences as to make the claim 
itself appear criminal. 


The confines of the Reich as they existed in 1914 were thoroughly 
illogical, because they were not really complete, in the sense of including all 
the members of the German people, nor were they reasonable, in view of the 
geographical exigencies of military defence. 


They were not the outcome of a well-considered political plan, they 
were temporary frontiers established in virtue of a political struggle that had 
not been fought to a finish, and indeed they were partly the chance result of 
circumstances. 


One would be equally justified (and in many cases better justified) in 
selecting any other year in our history and in demanding that the objective of 
our foreign policy should be the re-establishment of the conditions then 
existing. 


The demands I have mentioned are quite characteristic of our bourgeois 
compatriots, who, in such matters, take no politically productive thought for the 
future. 


They live only in the past and indeed only in the immediate past, for even 
their retrospect does not go back beyond their own times. 


The law of inertia binds them to the present order of things, leading them 
to oppose every attempt to change this. Their opposition, however, never takes 
the form of any kind of active defence, it is merely passive obstinacy. 


Therefore, we must regard it as quite natural that the political horizon of 
such people should not reach beyond 1914. In proclaiming that the aim of their 
political activities is to have the frontiers of that time restored, they only help 
to close up the rifts that are already becoming apparent in the league which our 
enemies have formed against us. 


Only on these grounds can we explain the fact that eight years after a 
world conflagration in which a number of allied belligerents had aspirations 
and aims that were partly in conflict with one another, the coalition of the 
victors still remains more or less solid. 


732 


Each of those States in its turn profited by the German collapse. In the 
fear which they all felt of our strength, the Great Powers maintained a mutual 
silence about their individual feelings of envy and enmity towards one another. 


They felt that to carry into effect a general process of expropriation of 
the Reich’s possessions would be the surest guarantee against the possibility of 
our resurgence. 


A bad conscience and fear of the strength of our people made up the 
durable cement which has held the members of that league together, even up to 
the present moment; nor have they been deceived by us. 


Inasmuch as our bourgeoisie sets up the restoration of the 1914 frontiers 
as the aim of Germany’s political programme, each member of the enemy 
coalition who might otherwise be inclined to withdraw from it, clings to the 
coalition for fear that he might, having lost the support of his allies, become an 
isolated object of attack. 


Each individual State feels itself endangered and threatened by this 
battle-cry, and that battle-cry itself is absurd, for the two following reasons: 
Firstly, because there is no available means of extricating it from the twilight 
atmosphere of club meetings and transforming it into something real. 


Secondly, because even if it could be carried into effect the result would 
be so futile that it would not be worth while to risk the blood of our people 
once again for such a purpose. 


There can be scarcely any doubt whatsoever that only through bloodshed 
could we achieve the restoration of the 1914 frontiers. 


One must have the simple mind of a child to believe that the revision of 
the Versailles Treaty can be obtained by indirect means and by beseeching the 
clemency of the victors—apart from the fact that for this we should need a 
Talleyrand, and there is no Talleyrand among us. 


Fifty per cent of our politicians are artful dodgers who are without 
character and hostile to our people, while the other fifty per cent is made up of 
well-meaning, harmless, and complaisant incompetents. 


Moreover, times have changed since the Congress of Vienna, it is no 
longer princes or their courtesans who haggle and bargain about State 
frontiers, but the inexorable cosmopolitan Jew who fights for dominion over 


733 


the nations. The sword is the only means whereby a nation can ward off that 
strangle-hold. 


Only when the concentrated might of rampant patriotic fervour is 
organised can it defy the menace of international enslavement of the nations. 
Such a course of action entails, and always will entail, bloodshed. If we are 
once convinced that the future of Germany calls for supreme effort, then, apart 
from considerations of political prudence, we are in duty bound to set up an 
aim that is worthy of that effort and to struggle to achieve it. 


The 1914 frontiers are of no significance for the future of the German 
nation. They did not serve to protect us in the past, nor do they offer any 
guarantee for our defence in the future. 


These frontiers do not help the German people to achieve internal unity, 
nor do they serve to safeguard its food-supplies. 


From the military standpoint these frontiers are neither strategically good 
nor even Satisfactory. 


Finally, they cannot serve to improve our present position in relation to 
other World Powers, or rather in relation to the real World Powers. 


They will not lessen the discrepancy between ourselves and Great 
Britain, nor help us to rival the United States its size. Not only that, but they 
would not serve to lessen substantially the importance of France in 
international politics. 


One thing alone is certain, namely, the attempt to restore the frontiers of 
1914, even if it proved successful, would lead to a further draining of the 
blood of our nation to such an extent that no virile men would be left to execute 
the revolutions and perform the deeds necessary in order to assure the future 
existence of the nation. 


On the contrary, under the intoxicating influence of such a superficial 
success further aims would be renounced, all the more so because so-called 
‘national honour’ would seem to be vindicated and new ports would be 
opened, at least for a certain time, to our commercial development. 


In the face of all this we National Socialists must adhere firmly to the 
aim that we have set for our foreign policy, namely, that the German people 
must be guaranteed that living-space to which it is entitled, and only in 


734 


pursuance of such an aim can the shedding of the blood of our people be 
justified in the eyes of God, and future generations of Germans. 


God—because we are sent into this world to struggle for our daily 
bread, as creatures to whom nothing is donated and who must be able to win 
and maintain their position as lords of the earth by virtue of their own 
intelligence and courage. 


Germans—in the eyes of further generations of Germans, since the blood 
of no German should be spilt unless it be to guarantee the lives of a thousand 
others yet unborn. 


The territory on which our German peasants will one day be able to rear 
sturdy sons will justify the sacrifice of the lives of sons of peasants to-day, and 
though the statesmen responsible for this sacrifice may be persecuted by their 
contemporaries, posterity will absolve them from the charge of having been 
guilty of bloodshed and of sacrificing the nation. Here I must protest sharply 
against those volkisch scribblers who pretend that such territorial extension 
would be a ‘violation of the sacred rights of man’ and accordingly attack it in 
their literary effusions. 


One never knows what are the hidden forces behind the activities of such 
persons. But it is certain that the confusion which they provoke suits the game 
our enemies are playing against our nation and is in accordance with their 
wishes. 


By the conception of this attitude such scribblers contribute in criminal 
fashion to weaken from within and to destroy our people’s will to defend their 
own vital interests by the only effective means that can be used for that 
purpose, for no nation on earth possesses a square yard of territory by decree 
of a higher Will and by virtue of a higher Right. 


The German frontiers are the outcome of chance and are only temporary 
frontiers that have been established as the result of political struggles which 
took place at various times. 


The same is also true of the frontiers which demarcate the territories in 
which other nations live. 


Only an imbecile could look on the physical geography of the globe as 
fixed and unchangeable. Actually, it represents only an apparent interval in a 
continual evolutionary process due to the certain action of the formidable 


TDS 


forces of Nature, and is liable to destruction and transformation to-morrow 
through still more formidable forces. 


So, too, in the lives of the nations the confines of their ‘living space’ are 
liable to change. State frontiers are established by human beings and may be 
altered by human beings. 


The fact that a nation has acquired an enormous territorial area is no 
reason why other nations should for ever acknowledge its right to that territory. 


At most, the possession of such territory is a proof of the might of the 
conqueror and the weakness of those who submit to him and this might alone is 


right. 


If the German people is cramped in an insufficient living space and is, 
for that reason, faced with a hopeless future, it is not by the law of Destiny, and 
the refusal to accept such a situation is by no means a violation of Destiny’s 
laws. 


Just as no Higher Power has allotted more territory to other nations than 
to the German nation, an unjust distribution of territory cannot constitute an 
offence against such a Power. 


The land in which we now live was not a gift bestowed by Heaven on 
our forefathers, but was conquered by them at the risk of their lives. 


Thus, now, in future our people will not acquire territory and with it the 
means of subsistence as a favour at the hands of any other nation, but will have 
to win it by the power of a triumphant sword. To-day we are all convinced of 
the necessity for regulating our position with regard to France; but our success 
here will be ineffectual in the vain if the general aims of our foreign policy 
stop at that. 


It can have significance for us only if it serves to cover our flank in the 
struggle for that extension of territory which is necessary for the existence of 
our people in Europe, for colonial acquisitions will not solve that question. 


It can be solved only by the acquisition of such territory for the 
settlement of our people as will extend the area of the mother-country and 
thereby not only keep the newly-settled population in close touch with the 
parent-country, but will guarantee the entire territory the enjoyment of those 
advantages accruing from its total size. 


736 


The vdlkisch Movement must not play the advocate for ether nations, but 
beg the protagonist of its own nation. Otherwise it would he superfluous and, 
above all, it would have no right to clamour against the past, for it would then 
be repeating the action of the past. 


The old German policy suffered from having been determined by 
dynastic considerations, the new German policy must not adopt the 
sentimentally cosmopolitan attitude of volkisch circles. 


Above all, we must riot form a police guard for the famous ‘small 
oppressed nations,’ but we must be the soldiers of the German nation. 


We National Socialists must go still further. The right to territory may 
become a duty when a great nation seems destined to go under unless its 
territory be extended, and that is particularly true when the nation in question is 
not a handful of Negroes, but the Germanic mother of all those who have given 
culture to the modern world. 


Germany will either become a World Power or will not continue to 
exist, but in order to become a World Power she needs that territorial area 
which would give her the necessary importance to-day and assure the existence 
of her citizens. 


Therefore, we National Socialists have purposely broken away from the 
line of conduct followed by pre-war Germany in foreign policy. 


We are beginning at the point at which our ancestors left off six hundred 
years ago. 


We are putting a stop to the eternal German trek towards Southern and 
Western Europe and are turning our eyes towards the lands that lie to the east 
of us. 


We are abandoning, once and for all, the colonial and commercial policy 
of pre-war days and are making a start upon the future policy of territorial 
expansion, but when we speak of new territory in Europe to-day we must think 
principally of Russia and the border states under her rule. Destiny itself seems 
to point the way for us here. In delivering Russia over to Bolshevism, Fate 
robbed the Russian people of that intellectual class which had once created the 
Russian State and was the guarantee for its existence. 


The Russian State as such was not the outcome of the ability of the Slav 


737 


to establish a constitution, but rather a marvellous example of the constructive 
political activity of the Germanic element in a race of inferior worth. 


This is the way in which many mighty empires throughout the world 
were created. More than once inferior races with Germanic organisers and 
rulers as their leaders became formidable States and continued to exist as long 
as the racial nucleus which had originally created the State remained. 


For centuries, Russia has lived on this Germanic nucleus of its governing 
classes, but to-day this nucleus has been practically exterminated. The Jew has 
taken its place. 


Just as it is impossible for the Russian, on his own, to shake off the 
Jewish yoke so, too, it is impossible for the Jew to keep this mighty State in 
existence for any lengthy period of time. 


He himself is by no means an organising element, but rather a ferment of 
decomposition. This colossal empire in the East is ripe for dissolution, and the 
end of the Jewish domination in Russia will also be the end of Russia as a 
State. 


We are chosen by Destiny to be the witnesses of a catastrophe which 
will afford the most striking confirmation of the volkisch theory of race. 


It is our task, and the mission of the National Socialist Movement, to 
develop in our people that political mentality which will enable them to 
realise that the aim which they must set themselves in future could not find 
fulfilment in the glorious enthusiasm of a victorious campaign fought with the 
ardour of an Alexander the Great. 


That the Jew should declare himself bitterly hostile to such a policy is 
only natural, for the Jew knows better than any other what the adoption of this 
line of conduct will mean for his own future. 


That fact alone ought to teach all genuine nationalists that this new 
orientation is the right one, but, unfortunately, the reverse 1s the case. 


Not only among the members of the German National Party, but also in 
purely volkisch circles, violent opposition is being raised against this Eastern 
European policy, and in connection with that opposition, as in all such cases, 
the authority of great men is cited. 


738 


The spirit of Bismarck is evoked in defence of a policy which is as 
stupid as it is impossible, and is in the highest degree detrimental to the 
German people. 


They say that Bismarck attached great importance to the maintenance of 
good relations with Russia. To a certain extent, that is true, but they quite forget 
to add that he laid equal stress on the importance of good relations with Italy, 
for example. 


Indeed, the same Herr von Bismarck once concluded an alliance with 
Italy so that he might more easily settle accounts with Austria. 


Why is this policy not continued to-day? The answer will be to the effect 
that the Italy of to-day is not the Italy of that time. 


Well then, honourable sirs, permit me to remind you that the Russia of to- 
day is no longer the Russia of that time. 


Bismarck never dreamt of laying down a political course of action 
which, from the tactical point of view, was to hold good for all time. He was 
too much the master of the hour to bind himself in that way. 


The question, therefore, ought not to be what did Bismarck do then, but 
rather what would he do to-day. 


And that question is much easier to answer. His political sagacity would 
never allow him to ally himself with a State that is doomed to disappear. 


Moreover, Bismarck looked upon the colonial and commercial policy of 
his time with mixed feelings, because at first, his chief concern was to find the 
surest way of consolidating and internally strengthening the state system which 
he himself had created. 


That was the sole reason why, at that time, he welcomed Russian 
protection in the rear, which gave hima free hand for his activities in the West, 
but what was then advantageous to Germany would now be detrimental. 


As early as 1920-21, the young National Socialist Movement was 
slowly, beginning to make itself felt in the political world and was spoken of 
in various circles as the movement for the liberation of the German nation. At 
that time it was approached from various quarters with the object of 
establishing definite relations with the liberationist movements in other 


739 


countries. 


This was quite in keeping with the much-advertised ‘League of 
Oppressed Nations.’ 


The persons concerned were, for the most part, representatives of some 
of the Balkan States and also of Egypt and India. They always impressed me as 
loquacious gentlemen who gave themselves airs, but had no real backing. 


Not a few Germans, however, especially in the nationalist camp, 
allowed themselves to be taken in by these pompous Orientals, and in the 
person of some Indian or Egyptian student they believed at once that they were 
face to face with a ‘representative’ of India or Egypt. 


They did not realise that, in most cases, they were dealing with persons 
who had no backing and who were not authorised to conclude any sort of 
agreement whatsoever, so that the practical result of any contact with such 
individuals was nil, unless one chose to enter the time spent thus as a dead 
loss. 


I was always on my guard against these attempts, not only because I had 
something better to do than to waste weeks in such sterile ‘discussions,’ but 
also because I believed that even if one were dealing with authorised 
representatives of such nations, the whole affair would be bound to turn out 
futile, if not positively harmful. 


Even in peace-time it was lamentable enough that the German policy of 
alliances, because it had no active and aggressive aims in view, ended ina 
defensive association of antiquated States which, as far as history was 
concerned were already on the retired list. 


There was little to be said either for the alliance with Austria or for that 
with Turkey. While the greatest military and industrial States of the earth had 
joined together in a league for purposes of active aggression, a few old and 
effete States were got together, and with this antique bric-a-brac an attempt 
was made to face an active world-coalition. 


Germany has had to pay dearly for that mistaken foreign policy and yet 
not dearly enough to prevent our incorrigible visionaries from falling into the 
same error again, for the attempt to bring about the disarmament of the all- 
powerful victorious States through a ‘League of Oppressed Nations’ is not only 
ridiculous, but disastrous. 


740 


It is disastrous because in that way the attention of the German people is 
again being diverted from real possibilities, which they abandon for the sake 
of fanciful and fruitless hopes and illusions. 


The German of to-day is like a drowning man who clutches at any straw. 
At the same time many of the people who are misled in this way are otherwise 
highly educated. 


Whenever some will-o’-the-wisp of a fantastic hope appears these 
people immediately pursue it. No matter whether it be a League of Oppressed 
Nations, a League of Nations, or some other fantastic invention, thousands of 
ingenuous souls will always be found to believe in it. 


I well remember the childishly incomprehensible hope that Britain’s 
downfall in India was imminent, which was cherished by volkisch circles in 
the years 1920-21. 


A few Asiatic mountebank, who may even have been sincere ‘champions 
of Indian freedom,’ were then at a loose end in Europe and succeeded in 
inspiring otherwise quite reasonable people with the fixed notion that the 
British World Empire, of which India was the hub, was just about to collapse 
there. 


They never realised that this was wishful thinking, nor did they stop to 
think how absurd their hopes were, for inasmuch as they expected the end of 
the British Empire and of Britain’s power to follow the collapse of its 
dominion over India, they themselves admitted that India was of paramount 
importance to Britain. 


It is more than probable that this vital question was not in the nature of a 
mystery known only to the prophets of German volkisch circles, but also to 
those in whose hands lay the shaping of British history. It is simply puerile to 
suppose that in Britain itself the importance of India for the British Empire was 
not adequately appreciated. 


It is a proof of failure to have learned a lesson from the World War and 
of a thorough misunderstanding and inability to recognise the quality of Anglo- 
Saxon determination, if anyone imagines that Britain would let India go without 
first putting forth the last ounce of her strength in a struggle to hold it. 


Moreover, it shows how complete is the ignorance prevailing in 
Germany as to the manner in which Britain administers her Empire and 


741 


permeates it with her spirit. 


Britain will never lose India unless her administrative machinery 
becomes corrupt as a result of racial contamination (which 1s at present 
entirely out of the question in India), or unless she is overcome by the sword of 
some powerful enemy. Indian risings will never bring this about. 


We Germans have had sufficient experience to know how hard it is to 
overcome Britain, and apart from all this, I as a Teuton, would far rather see 
India under British rule than under that of any other nation. 


The hopes founded on a legendary rising in Egypt were just as 
chimerical. The ‘Holy War’ may give our German nincompoops the pleasing 
illusion that others are now prepared to shed their blood for them. 


Indeed this cowardly speculation is almost always the father of such 
hopes, but in actual fact the ‘Holy War’ would soon be brought to a sanguinary 
conclusion under the withering fire of British machine-guns and a hail of 
British shells. 


A coalition of cripples cannot attack a powerful State which is 
determined, if necessary, to shed the last drop of its blood in order to preserve 
its existence. 


I, as a nationalist, who estimate the worth of humanity according to 
racial standards, must, in recognising the inferiority of the so-called 
‘oppressed nations’, refuse to link the destiny of my own people with the 
destiny of theirs. 


To-day we must take up the same attitude towards Russia. 


The Russia of to-day, deprived of its Germanic ruling class, is, apart 
from the secret designs of its new rulers, no suitable ally in the struggle for 
German liberty. 


From the purely military point of view, a Russo-German coalition 
waging war against Western Europe, and probably against the whole world on 
that account, would be catastrophic for us. 


The struggle would have to be fought out, not on Russian, but on German 
territory, without Germany being able to receive from Russia the slightest 
effective support. The military forces at the disposal of the present German 


742 


Reich are so small and so inadequate for the waging of a foreign war that it 
would be impossible to defend our frontiers against Western Europe, Britain 
included. 


The industrial area of Germany would have to be abandoned undefended 
before the concentrated attack of our adversaries, It must be added that 
between Germany and Russia there is the Polish State, completely in the hands 
of the French. 


Should Germany and Russia together wage war against Western Europe, 
Russia would have to overthrow Poland before the first Russian soldier could 
be conveyed to a German front, but it is less a question of soldiers than of 
technical equipment. 


In this respect our plight during the World War would be repeated, but in 
a more terrible manner. 


At that time, German, industry had to be drained to help our glorious 
allies, and on the technical side Germany had to carry on the war almost alone. 


In this new hypothetical war Russia, as a technical factor, would count 
for nothing. We should have practically nothing to oppose to the general 
mechanisation of the world, which in the next war will assume overwhelming 
and decisive proportions. 


In this important field Germany has not only shamefully lagged behind, 
but would, with the little she has, have to reinforce Russia, which at the 
present moment does not possess a single factory capable of producing a 
motor-car in good running order. 


Under such conditions such a struggle would assume the character of 
sheer slaughter. The youth of Germany would have to shed more of its blood 
than it did even in the World War; for, as always, it would fall to us to bear the 
brunt of the fighting, and the result would be an inevitable catastrophe. 


Even supposing that a miracle took place and that this war did not end in 
the total annihilation of Germany, the final result would be that the German 
nation would be bled white, and, surrounded as she would be by great military 
States, her real situation would be in no way ameliorated. 


It is useless to object here that in case of an alliance with Russia we 
should not think of an immediate war or that anyhow we should have the means 


743 


of making thorough preparations for war. 


This is absurd, since an alliance which is not for the purpose of waging 
war has no meaning and no value. The object of forming an alliance is to wage 
war. 


Even though, at the moment when an alliance is concluded, the prospect 
of war is a distant one, still the idea of the situation developing towards war is 
the reason underlying the formation of an alliance. 


It is out of the question to think that the other Powers would be deceived 
as to the purpose of such an alliance. A Russo-German coalition would either 
remain a mere scrap of paper (in which case it would have no meaning for us), 
or the terms of the agreement would be put into effect, and in that case the rest 
of the world would be forewarned. 


It would be childish to think that in such circumstances Britain and 
France would wait ten years to give the Russo-German alliance time to 
complete its technical preparations. 


Far from it, the storm would break over Germany immediately. The fact 
of forming an alliance with Russia would, therefore; be the signal for a new 
war, the result of which would be the end of Germany. 


To these considerations the following must be added: 


(1) Those who are in power in Russia to-day have no intention of 
forming an honourable alliance or of remaining true to it, 1f they did. 


It must never be forgotten that the present rulers of Russia are blood- 
stained criminals, that here we have the dregs of humanity which, favoured by 
the circumstances of a tragic moment, overran a great State, and, in their lust 
for blood, killed and extirpated millions of educated people belonging to the 
ruling classes, and that now for nearly ten years they have ruled with a savage 
tyranny such as has never been known. 


It must not be forgotten that these rulers belong to a people in which the 
most bestial cruelty is allied to a capacity for artful mendacity and which, to- 
day more than ever, believes itself called upon to impose its sanguinary 
despotism on the rest of the world. 


It must not be forgotten that the international Jew, who is to-day absolute 


744 


master in Russia, does not look upon Germany as an ally, but as a State 
condemned to the same doom as Russia itself. 


One does not form an alliance with a partner whose only aim is the 
destruction of his co-partner. 


Above all, one does not enter into alliances with people to whom no 
treaty is sacred, because they do not exist as the upholders of truth and honour, 
but as the protagonists of lying and deception, thievery, plunder and robbery. 


The man who thinks that he can enter into a treaty with parasites is like a 
tree that believes it can make a bargain with the mistletoe that feeds on it. 


(2) The menace to which Russia once succumbed is perpetually hanging 
over Germany. 


Only a bourgeois simpleton could imagine that the Bolshevist danger has 
been overcome. In his superficial way of thinking he does not suspect that here 
we are dealing with a phenomenon that is due to an urge of the blood, namely, 
the aspiration of the Jewish people to become the despots of the world. 


That aspiration is quite as natural as the impulse of the Anglo-Saxon to 
rule the world, and as the Anglo-Saxon chooses his own way of attaining those 
ends and fights for them with characteristic weapons, so does the Jew. 


The Jew follows his own methods, he insinuates himself into the very 
heart of the nations and then proceeds to undermine the national structure from 
within. 

The weapons with which he works are lies and calumny, poisonous 


infection and disintegration, intensifying the struggle until he has succeeded in 
exterminating his hated adversary to the accompaniment of much bloodshed. 


In Russian Bolshevism we must recognise the kind of attempt which is 
being made by the Jew in the twentieth century to secure dominion over the 
world. In other epochs he worked towards the same goal, but with different, 
though fundamentally similar, means. 


The ambition of the Jew is part and parcel of his very nature. Just as no 
other people would voluntarily check the instinct to increase in numbers or in 
power, unless forced to do so by external circumstances or senile decay, so the 
Jew will never, of his own accord, repress his eternal urge and abandon his 


745 


struggle for world dictatorship. 


Only external forces can thwart him, or his instinct for world domination 
will die out with his race. 


If nations become impotent or extinct through senility it is because they 
have failed to preserve their racial purity. 


The Jews preserve the purity of their blood better than any other people 
on earth. Thus the Jew pursues his fateful course until he meets another and 
superior force and after a desperate struggle he who would have stormed the 
heavens is hurled back once more to the regions of Lucifer. 


To-day Germany is Bolshevism’s next objective. All the force of a fresh 
missionary idea is needed to rouse our nation once more, to free it from the 
toils of the international serpent and stop the process of corruption of our 
blood from within. 


The forces of our nation, thus liberated, may be employed to preserve 
our nationality and in this way, prevent a repetition of the recent catastrophe 
from taking place even in the most distant future. 


If this be the goal we set ourselves, it would be folly to ally ourselves 
with a country whose ruler is the mortal enemy of our future. 


How can we release our people from this poisonous grip if we ourselves 
accept it? 


How can we teach the German worker that Bolshevism is an infamous 
crime against humanity if we ally ourselves with this infernal abortion and 
recognise its existence as legitimate? 


What right have we to condemn the members of the broad masses whose 
sympathies lie with a certain Weltanschauung if the rulers of our State choose 
the representatives of that Weltanschauung as their allies? The struggle against 
the Jewish Bolshevisation of the world demands that we should declare our 
position towards Soviet Russia. We cannot cast out the Devil through 
Beelzebub. 


If to-day even volkisch circles are eager for an alliance with Russia, let 
there but pause to look around in Germany itself, in order that they may realise 
from what quarter their support comes. 


746 


Do these people holding vélkisch views believe that a policy which is 
recommended and acclaimed by the Marxist international press can benefit the 
German people? 


Since when do they fight with weapons provided by the Jew? 


One reproach which could be levelled against the old German Reich 
with regard to its policy of alliances was that it spoiled its relations towards 
all other States by continual vacillation and by its weakness in trying to 
preserve world peace at all costs, but one reproach which cannot be levelled 
against it is that it failed to maintain good relations with Russia. 


I frankly admit that, before the War, I thought it would have been better if 
Germany had abandoned her senseless colonial policy and her naval policy 
and had joined Britain in an alliance against Russia. Thereby Germany would 
renounce her weak world policy for a determined European policy, with the 
idea of acquiring new territory on the Continent. 


I do not forget the constant insolent threats which Pan-Slav Russia made 
against Germany. I do not forget the continual mobilisation rehearsals, the sole 
object of which was to irritate Germany. 


I cannot forget the tone of public opinion in Russia which, in pre-war 
days, excelled itself in hate-inspired outbursts against our nation and our 
Reich, nor can I forget the big Russian press which was always more 
favourable to France than to us. 


Yet, despite all this, another alternative was open to us before the War. 
We might have won the support of Russia and turned against Britain. 


Circumstances are entirely different to-day. Although, before the War, we 
might have swallowed our pride and marched at the side of Russia, that is no 
longer possible to-day. 


Since then the hand of the world-clock has moved forward and points the 
hour in which the destiny of our people must be decided one way or another. 


The present process of consolidation now being carried out by the great 
States of the world is the last warning signal to us to look to ourselves, to bring 
our people back from the realm of visions to the realm of hard facts and point 
the sole way into the future, which will lead the old Reich to a new era of 


prosperity. 


747 


If, in view of this great and most important task before it, the, National 
Socialist Movement sets aside all illusions and takes reason as its sole guide, 
the catastrophe of 1918 may turn out to be an infinite blessing for the future of 
our nation. 


As a result of the collapse our nation may succeed in adopting an entirely 
new attitude with regard to foreign policy, and strengthened within by its new 
Weltanschauung, the German nation may finally stabilise its foreign policy. 


It may end by gaining what Britain has, what even Russia had, and what 
enabled France again and again to make analogous decisions which ultimately 
proved to be to her advantage, namely, a political testament. 


The fundamental principles of the political testament of the German 
nation determining the course of its foreign policy shall be as follows: Never 
permit two continental Powers to arise in Europe. 


Look upon every attempt to establish a second military Power on the 
frontiers of Germany, be it only in the shape of a State capable of becoming a 
military power, as tantamount to an attack upon Germany. 


Regard it not only as your right, but as your duty, to prevent by every 
possible means, including resort to arms, the establishment of such a State, and 
to crush it, should it be established. 


See to it that the strength of our nation does not rest on colonial 
foundations, but on those of our own native territory in Europe. 


Never consider the Reich secure unless, for centuries to come, it is ina 
position to give every descendant of our race a piece of ground that he can call 
his own. 


Never forget that the most sacred of all rights in this world is man’s right 
to the soil which he wishes to cultivate for himself and that the holiest of all 
sacrifices is that of the blood shed for it. 


I should not like to conclude these remarks without referring once again 
to the sole possibility of an alliance that exists for us in Europe at the present 
moment. 


In the previous chapter dealing with the problem of Germany’s policy of 
alliances, I mentioned Britain and Italy as the only countries with which it 


748 


would be worth while for us to strive to forma close alliance and that such an 
alliance would be advantageous. 


I should like here to deal briefly with the military importance of such an 
alliance. 


The military consequences of this alliance would be the direct opposite 
of the consequences of an alliance with Russia. 


Most important of all 1s the fact that a rapprochement with Britain and 
Italy would in no way involve a danger of war. 


The only Power liable to oppose such an alliance would be France who 
would scarcely be in a position to do so. Thus, such an alliance would afford 
Germany an opportunity of quietly making those preparations which, within the 
framework of such a coalition, would necessarily have to lie made with a view 
to settling accounts with France. 


The lull significance of such an alliance lies in the fact that its 
conclusion would not automatically lay Germany open to the threat of invasion, 
but that the very coalition would be broken up, that is to say, the Entente which 
has been the cause of so many of our misfortunes, would be dissolved, thus 
making France, our inveterate enemy, the victim of violation. 


Even though this success would at first have only a moral effect, 1t would 
be sufficient to allow Germany such liberty of action as we cannot now 
imagine, for the new Anglo-German-Italian alliance would have the political 
initiative and no longer France. 


A further result would be that at one stroke Germany would finally be 
delivered from her unfavourable strategical position. 


On the one side, her flank would be strongly protected and, on the other, 
the guarantee that we would have an adequate supply of foodstuffs and raw 
materials would be a beneficial result of this new coalition of States. 


Almost more important, however, is the fact that this new league would 
include States whose potential of technical production would, in many 
respects, be mutually complementary. 


For the first ttme Germany would have allies who would not like 
vampires suck the life-blood of her industry, but could, and would, contribute 


749 


liberally to the completion of our technical equipment. 


We must not forget one final fact, namely, that in this case we should not 
have allies like Turkey or present-day Russia. 


The greatest World Power on this earth and a young national State would 
constitute factors ina European struggle which were very different from the 
corrupt and decadent Powers to which Germany was allied in the last war. 


As I have already said, there are great obstacles in the way of such an 
alliance. But was not the formation of the Entente somewhat more difficult? 


Where King Edward VII succeeded, partly in the face of traditional 
interests, we must and will succeed, if we are so convinced of the necessity for 
such a development that we are wisely prepared to conquer our own feelings 
and carry the policy through. 


This will be possible only when, driven to action by suffering and 
distress, we renounce the shilly-shallying foreign policy of recent decades and 
follow unswervingly a course of action in pursuit of a definite aim. 


The future goal of our foreign policy ought to be neither a Western nor an 
Eastern bias; it ought to be an Eastern policy the object of which is the 
acquisition of such territory as 1s necessary in order that the German people 
can live. 


To carry out this policy we need that force of which France, the mortal 
enemy of our nation, is now depriving us by holding us in her grip and 
pitilessly robbing us of our strength. 


We must, therefore, stop at no sacrifice in an effort to stop France’s 
striving for hegemony in Europe. As our natural ally to-day we have every 
Power on the Continent which, like ourselves, feels France’s lust for mastery 
in Europe unbearable. 


No attempt to approach those Powers ought to appear too difficult to us, 
and no sacrifice should be considered too great, if the final outcome would be 
to make it possible for us to overthrow our most bitter enemy. 


The minor wounds will be cured by the beneficent influence of Time, 
once the major wound has been cauterised and closed. 


Naturally, the internal enemies of our people will how] with rage, but let 


750 


us, as National Socialists, not be misled into ceasing to advocate what our 
most profound conviction tells us to be necessary. 


We must oppose the current of public opinion which will be led astray 
by Jewish cunning in exploiting our German lack of perception. 


The waves may often rage and roar around us; but the man who swims 
with the current attracts less attention than he who buffets it. 


To-day we are but a rock in the river. Ina few years Fate may raise us up 
as a dam against which the general current will be broken, only to flow 
forward in a new bed. 


It is, therefore, necessary that in the eyes of the rest of the world our 
Movement should be recognised as representing a definite political 
programme. 


Whatever fate Heaven may have in store for us, we must be recognised 
by an outward and visible sign. 


As long as we ourselves recognise the ineluctable necessity which must 
determine our foreign policy, this knowledge will lend us that power of 
endurance which we often require when, under the withering fire of the 
opposition press, some of us experience fear and are assailed by the temptation 
to make concessions here or there and ‘to do as the Romans do,’ in order not to 
have the whole world against us.

753 


CHAPTER XV: THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE 


After we had laid down our arms, in November 1918, a policy was 
adopted which, as far as man could foretell, was bound to lead gradually to 
our complete subjugation. 


Analogous examples culled from history show that those nations which 
lay down their arms without being absolutely forced to do so, subsequently 
prefer to submit to the greatest humiliations and exactions rather than try to 
change their fate by resorting to arms again. 


That can be explained on purely human grounds. A shrewd conqueror 
will always enforce his demands on the conquered only by stages, as far as that 
is possible. 


Then he may be reasonably certain that a people who have lost all 
strength of character (which is always true of every nation that voluntarily 
submits to the threats of an opponent) will not find in any of these acts of 
oppression, if one be enforced apart from the other, sufficient grounds for 
taking up arms again. 


The more often the conquered nation submits to extortion, the less 
justifiable in its eyes is the final revolt against a fresh and apparently isolated, 
but constantly recurring act of extortion, especially if more and greater 
misfortunes have already been borne in silence and with patience. 


The fall of Carthage is a terrible example of the slow destruction of a 
people for which they themselves were to blame. 


In his Drei Bekenntnisse, Clausewitz expressed this idea admirably and 
gave it a definite form when he said, ‘The stigma of shame incurred by 
cowardly submission can never be effaced. The drop of poison which thus 
enters the blood of a nation will be transmitted to posterity. It will undermine 
and paralyse the strength of later generations.’ 


But he added that, on the contrary, ‘even the loss of liberty after a 
sanguinary and honourable struggle ensures the resurgence of a nation and 1s 
the vital nucleus from which a new tree will one day put forth sound roots.’ 


Naturally, a nation which has lost all sense of honour and all strength of 
character will not feel the force of such a doctrine, but any nation that takes it 


754 


to heart will never fall so low. Only those who forget it or do not wish to 
acknowledge it will collapse. Hence, those responsible for a cowardly 
submission cannot be expected suddenly to change their line of conduct in 
accordance with the dictates of common sense and human experience. 


On the contrary, they will repudiate such a doctrine, either until the 
people becomes habituated to the yoke of slavery or until the better elements of 
the nation come to the fore and wrest the power from the hands of the infamous 
corrupter. 


In the first case these who hold power will be pleased with the state of 
affairs, because the conquerors often entrust them with the duties of slave- 
driver, and they, as utterly characterless beings, are then more cruel in the 
exercise of their authority over their own countrymen than the most cruel alien 
appointed to the task by the enemy. 


The events which happened in Germany after 1918 prove how the hope 
of securing the clemency of the victor by means of a voluntary submission had 
the most disastrous influence on the political attitude and conduct of the broad 
masses. 


I say ‘the broad masses’ expressly, because I cannot persuade myself that 
the things which were done or left undone by the leaders of the people are to 
be attributed to a similar disastrous illusion. 


Seeing that since the war our fate has been in the hands of the Jews, and 
to-day admittedly so, it is impossible to assume that a defective knowledge of 
the state of affairs was the sole cause of our misfortunes. 


On the contrary, we may take it for granted that our people were 
intentionally brought to ruin. 


Looked at from this point of view the apparent insanity of our 
government’s foreign policy is revealed as a piece of shrewd calculating logic, 
put into effect in order to promote the Jewish idea of a struggle for world- 
mastery. 


Thus it appears comprehensible that the same period of seven years, 
which, after 1806, sufficed to imbue Prussia (which had been in a state of 
collapse) with fresh vitality and the zeal for battle, has to-day not only been 
wasted, but has led to a steady sapping of the vital strength of the State. 


755 


Seven years after November 1918 the Locarno Pact was signed. Thus the 
development which occurred took the form I have indicated above. 


Once the shameful Armistice had been signed, our people were unable to 
pluck up sufficient courage and energy to offer a sudden resistance to the 
oppressive measures adopted and constantly repeated by the enemy, who was 
too shrewd to put forward too many demands at once. 


He invariably limited his exactions to, amounts which, in his opinion and 
that of our German Government, could be submitted to for the moment, thus 
avoiding the risk of an outburst of public feeling. 


But, the more frequently single impositions were accepted and tolerated, 
the less justifiable did it appear to do now, on account of one single imposition 
or attempted humiliation, what had not been done previously in the case of so 
many others, namely, to offer resistance. That is the ‘drop of poison’ of which 
Clausewitz speaks. Once this lack of character is manifested the resultant 
condition becomes steadily aggravated and weighs like an evil heritage on all 
future decisions. 


It may become a millstone round the nation’s neck, which cannot be 
shaken off, but which forces it to drag out its existence in slavery. 


Thus, in Germany measures enforcing disarmament, oppression, 
economic spoliation and measures designed to render us politically 
defenceless followed one upon the other. 


The result of all this was to create that mood which made so many look 
upon the Dawes Plan as a blessing and the Locarno Pact as a success. 


From a higher point of view we may speak of one sole blessing in the 
midst of so much misery, namely, that, though men may be fooled, Heaven 
cannot be bribed, for Heaven withheld its blessing. 


Since that time misery and anxiety have been the constant companions of 
our people, and distress is the one ally that has remained loyal to us. 


Here, too, Destiny has made no exceptions. It has given us our deserts. 
Since we did not know how to value honour, it has taught us to value liberty 
through want of bread. 


Now that the nation has learned to cry for bread, it may one day learn to 


756 


pray for freedom. 


Bitter and obvious as the collapse of our nation was in the years 
following 1918 that was nevertheless the time chosen to persecute with the 
utmost severity anyone who presumed to foretell what afterwards invariably 
took place. 


This was particularly so when it was a question of ‘silencing’ warning 
voices which were unwelcome because unpleasant. 


The government to which our people submitted was as hopelessly 
incompetent as it was conceited, and this was evinced in their attitude towards 
those who made themselves unpopular by issuing disconcerting warnings. 


Then we saw, as we can see to-day, the greatest parliamentary 
nincompoops, really common saddlers and glove-makers (not merely by trade, 
for that would signify very little) suddenly raised to the rank of statesmen and 
sermonising to humble mortals from that pedestal. 


It did not matter, and it still does not matter, that such a ‘statesman,’ after 
having displayed his talents for six months is shown up for what he is, namely, 
a mere windbag, and becomes the object of public scorn. 


It does not matter that he has given the most conclusive proof of 
complete incompetency. 


On the contrary, the less real the service parliamentary statesmen of this 
Republic render the country, the more savagely do they persecute all who 
expect them to achieve something or who dare to point to their failures and to 
predict similar failures in the future. 


Should anyone finally succeed in pinning down one of these 
parliamentarians to hard facts, so that this ‘statesman’ is unable to deny the 
failure of his whole policy and its results, he will find innumerable excuses for 
his lack of success, but will in no way admit that he himself, is the chief cause 
of the evil. 


By the winter of 1922-23, at the latest, it ought to have, been generally 
recognised that, even after the conclusion of peace, France was still 
endeavouring with iron consistency to realise her original war aims. It is 
inconceivable that for four and a half years France should have continued to 
sacrifice the none too abundant supply of her national blood in the most 


757 


decisive struggle throughout her history in order subsequently to obtain 
compensation through reparations for the damages sustained. 


Even Alsace and Lorraine, taken by themselves, would not account for 
the energy with which the French conducted the War, if Alsace-Lorraine were 
not already considered as a part of the really vast programme which French 
foreign policy had envisaged for the future. 


The aim of that programme was the dismemberment of Germany into a 
number of small states. It was for this that chauvinist France waged war, and in 
so doing she was in reality selling her people as mercenaries to the 
international Jew. 


This French war aim would have been attained through the World War if, 
as was originally hoped in Paris, the struggle had been fought out on German 
soil. 


Let us imagine the bloody battles of the World War not as having taken 
place on the Somme, in Flanders, in Artois, outside Warsaw, Nishni- 
Novogorod, Kowno and Riga, but in Germany, in the Ruhr or on the Maine, on 
the Elbe, outside Hanover, Leipzig, Niirnberg, etc.; had this happened, then we 
must admit that the destruction of Germany might have been accomplished. 


It is very doubtful whether our young federal State could have borne the 
hard struggle for four and a half years, as it was borne by a France that had 
been centralised for centuries, with the whole national imagination focussed on 
Paris. 


If this titanic conflict between the nations took place beyond the frontiers 
of our Fatherland, not only is all the merit due to the immortal service rendered 
by our old Army, but it was also very fortunate for the future of Germany. 


I am of the firm conviction (and this conviction often fills me with dread) 
that if things had taken a different course there would no longer be a German 
Reich, but only ‘German states,’ and that is the only reason why the blood 
which was shed by our friends and brothers during the War was not shed quite 
in vain. 


Events took a different turn. In November 1918 Germany did indeed 
collapse with lightning suddenness, but when the catastrophe took place at 
home the Army was still holding a line deep in the enemy’s country. 


758 


At that time France’s first preoccupation was not the dismemberment of 
Germany, but the problem of how to get the German troops out of France, and 
Belgium as quickly as possible. In order to put an end to the War, the first thing 
that had to be done by the French Government was to disarm the German 
troops and push them back into Germany if possible. 


Until this was done the French could not devote their attention to 
realising their own particular and original war aims. 


France was, however, hindered in this by the fact that as far as Britain 
was concerned, the War was really only won when Germany was destroyed as 
a colonial and commercial power, and was reduced to the rank of a second- 
class State. 


It was not to Britain’s interest to wipe out the German State altogether. In 
fact, on many grounds it was desirable for her to have a future rival against 
France in Europe. 


France was therefore forced to carry on by peaceful means the work for 
which the War had paved the way; and Clemenceau’s statement, that for him 
peace was merely a continuation of the War, thus acquired added significance. 


Persistently and at every possible opportunity the effort to dislocate the 
framework of the Reich had to be continued. By perpetually sending new notes 
that demanded disarmament, on the one hand, and by the imposition of 
economic levies, on the other, which could be carried out as a result of the 
process of disarmament, it was hoped in Paris that the framework of the Reich 
would gradually become unstable. 


The more the Germans lost their sense of national honour, the more 
would economic pressure and continued economic distress be effective as 
factors of political destruction. 


Such a policy of political oppression and economic exploitation, carried 
out for ten or twenty years, must it was believed, in the long run steadily ruin 
and eventually disintegrate the most solid national body. 


Then the French war aims would have been definitely attained. By the 
winter of 1922-23 the intentions of the French must have long been obvious. 


There remained only two possible ways of confronting the situation. It 
was hoped that either French determination might be blunted by the toughness 


759 


of the German national body, or, that it might at least be possible to do what 
was bound to become inevitable one day—that is to say, under the provocation 
of some particularly brutal act of oppression to put the helm of the German 
ship of state to roundabout and ram the enemy. 


That would naturally involve a life-and-death struggle. The chance of 
surviving this struggle depended on whether France could be so far isolated 
beforehand that in this second conflict, Germany would not have to fight 
against the whole world, but in defence of Germany against a France that was 
persistently disturbing the peace of the world. 


I insist on this point, and I am profoundly convinced that it 1s inevitable 
that this second alternative will one day come about. 


I shall never believe that France will of herself alter her intentions 
towards us, because they are, at bottom, only the expression of the French 
instinct for self-preservation. 


Were I a Frenchman, and were the greatness of France as dear to me as 
that of Germany is sacred, I neither could nor would act otherwise than a 
Clemenceau. 


The French nation, which is slowly dying out, not so much through 
depopulation as through the progressive disappearance of the best elements of 
the race, can continue to play an important role in the world only if Germany 
be dismembered. 


French policy may make a thousand detours on the march towards its 
fixed goal, but the destruction of Germany is the end which it always has in 
view as the fulfilment of the most profound desire and ultimate intentions of the 
French. 


Now, it is a mistake to believe that if the will on one side remains 
merely passive and intent on its own self-preservation, it can hold out 
permanently against another will which is not less forceful, but is active. 


As long as the eternal conflict between France and Germany is waged 
only in the form of a German defence against the French attack, it will never be 
brought to a conclusion, although Germany will, in the course of centuries, lose 
one foothold after another. 


If we study the changes, the line of demarcation of the German language 


760 


has undergone from the twelfth century up to our day, in the frontier, within 
which the German language is spoken, we can hardly hope for future success 
from an attitude and development which have hitherto been so detrimental to 
us. 


Only when the Germans have fully realised all this will they cease to 
allow the national will to live to peter out in passive defence, but will rally it 
for a last decisive contest with France and a final struggle for the realisation of 
Germany’s highest aims. 


Only then will it be possible to put an end to the eternal Franco-German 
conflict which has hitherto proved so sterile. Of course it is here presumed that 
Germany sees in the suppression of France nothing more than a means which 
will make it possible for our people finally to expand in another direction. 


To-day there are eighty million Germans in Europe, and our foreign 
policy will be recognised as rightly conducted only when, after barely a 
hundred years, there will be two hundred and fifty million Germans living on 
this Continent, not packed together like coolies and working in factories at the 
bidding of the rest of the world, but as tillers of the soil and workers whose 
labours will be a mutual guarantee for their existence. 


In December 1922, the situation between Germany and France assumed a 
particularly threatening aspect. France had new and comprehensive oppressive 
measures in view and needed pledges. 


Political pressure had to precede economic exploitation, and the French 
believed that only by making a violent attack upon the central nervous system 
of German life would they be able to make our ‘recalcitrant’ people bow to 
their galling yoke. 


By the occupation of the Ruhr, it was hoped in France that not only 
would the moral backbone of Germany be finally broken, but that we should be 
reduced to such grave economic straits that we should be forced to subscribe 
willy-nilly to the heaviest possible obligations. 


It was a question of bending and breaking Germany. At first Germany 
bent and subsequently broke down completely. 


Through the occupation of the Ruhr, Fate once more reached out its hand 
to the German people and gave them the chance to arise, for what at first 
appeared as a heavy stroke of misfortune was found, on closer examination, to 


761 


be an extremely promising opportunity of bringing Germany’s sufferings to an 
end. 


As regards foreign politics, the action of France in occupying the Ruhr 
really estranged Britain for the first time, Indeed it estranged not merely British 
diplomatic circles, which had concluded, appraised and upheld the Anglo- 
French alliance in a spirit of calm and objective calculation, but it also 
estranged large sections of the British public. 


The English business-world in particular ill concealed its displeasure at 
this incredible additional strengthening of the power of France on the 
Continent. 


Not only had France now assumed from the military standpoint alone a 
position in Europe such as Germany herself had not held previously, but she 
thus obtained control of economic resources which, from the practical point of 
view, combined her ability to compete in the political world with economic 
advantages almost amounting to a monopoly. 


The most important iron and coal mines in Europe were now all in the 
hands of one nation which, in contrast to Germany, had hitherto defended its 
vital interests in an active and resolute fashion and which had, during the Great 
War, given the world fresh proof of its military efficiency. The French 
occupation of the Ruhr coal-fields effectively cancelled all that Britain had 
gained by the War, and the victors were no longer the diligent and painstaking 
British statesmen, but Marshal Foch and the France he represented. 


In Italy also the attitude towards France, which, in any case, had not been 
very favourable since the end of the War, now became positively hostile. 


The great and critical moment had come when the Allies of yesterday 
might become the enemies of to-morrow. The fact that events took another 
course and that the Allies did not suddenly come into conflict with one another, 
as in the Second Balkan War, was due to the fact that Germany had no Enver 
Pasha, but merely a Cuno, as Chancellor of the Reich. 


Nevertheless, the French invasion of the Ruhr opened up great 
possibilities for the future, not only in the field of Germany’s foreign policy, 
but also of her internal politics. 


A considerable section of our people who, thanks to the persistent 
influence of a mendacious press, had looked upon France as the champion of 


762 


progress and liberty, were suddenly cured of its illusion. 


As in 1914 the dream of international solidarity was suddenly banished 
from the minds of our German working class and they were brought back to the 
world of everlasting struggle, where one creature feeds on the other and where 
the death of the weaker implies the life of the stronger, so again in the spring of 
1923. 


When the French put their threat into effect and penetrated, at first 
hesitatingly and cautiously, into the coalfield of the Ruhr the hour of destiny 
had struck for Germany. 


If, at that moment, our people had changed not only their frame of mind, 
but also their conduct, the German Ruhr could have been made for France what 
Moscow was for Napoleon. 


Indeed, there were only two possibilities—either to tolerate this new 
move, in addition to all the rest and to do nothing, or to focus the attention of 
the German people on, that region of sweltering forges and blazing furnaces, 
thus firing them with the determination to put an end to this persistent 
humiliation and to face the horrors of the moment rather than submit to a terror 
that was endless. 


Cuno, who was then Chancellor of the Reich, can claim the immortal 
merit of having discovered a third way, and our German bourgeois political 
parties merit the still greater glory of having admired him and collaborated 
with him. 


I shall first deal as briefly as possible with the second alternative. By 
occupying the Ruhr, France committed a flagrant violation of the Versailles 
Treaty. Her action brought her into conflict with several of the guarantor 
Powers, and especially with Britain and Italy. 


She could no longer hope that those States would back her in her 
egotistic act of brigandage. She could only count on bringing the adventure, for 
such it was at the start, to a satisfactory conclusion by her own unaided efforts. 


For a German National Government there was only one alternative, 
namely, the course which honour prescribed. 


Certainly at the beginning we could not have opposed France with active 
armed resistance, but it should have been clearly recognised that any 


763 


negotiations which did not have the argument of force to back them up would 
turn out futile and ridiculous. 


It was absurd to adopt the attitude, ‘We refuse to take part in any 
negotiations,’ unless there was a possibility of offering active resistance, but it 
was still more absurd to consent finally to negotiate without having meantime 
organised a supporting force. 


At the same time, it was, of course, impossible for us to prevent the 
occupation of the Ruhr by the adoption of military measures. 


Only a madman could have recommended such a course, but while the 
impression made by the French action lasted and during the time that that action 
was being carried out, measures could have been, and should have been 
undertaken without any regard to the Versailles Treaty—which France herself 
had violated—to collect a military force which would serve as a collateral 
argument to back up the negotiators later on. 


For it was quite clear from the beginning that the fate of this district 
occupied by the French would one day be decided at some conference table or 
other. 


It must also be quite clear to everybody that even the best negotiators 
have little hope of success as long as the ground on which they stand and the 
very chair on which they sit are not under the armed protection of their own 
people. 


A weak pigmy cannot argue with athletes and a negotiator without armed 
defence at his back must always acquiesce when a Brennus throws his sword 
into the scales on the enemy’s side, unless he can preserve the balance with an 
equally mighty sword of his own. 


It was distressing to watch the comedy of negotiations which, ever since 
1918, regularly preceded each arbitrary dictate that the enemy imposed upon 
us. 


We presented a sorry spectacle in the eyes of the whole world when we 
were invited, as if in derision, to attend conferences, simply to be presented 
with decisions and programmes which had already been drawn up and passed 
a long time previously, and which, though we were permitted to discuss them, 
had, from the outset, to be considered as unalterable. 


764 


It is true that in scarcely a single instance were our negotiators men of 
more than mediocre ability. For the most part they justified only too well the 
sarcastic remark made by Lloyd George with reference to Herr Simon, an ex- 
cabinet minister of the Reich, that the Germans were not able to choose men of 
intelligence as their leaders and representatives. 


But in face of the enemy’s resolute determination to acquire power, on 
the one side, and the lamentable defencelessness of Germany, on the other, 
even a genius could have achieved but little. 


In the spring of 1923, however, anyone who weighed the possibility of 
seizing the opportunity of the French invasion of the Ruhr to reconstruct the 
military power of Germany would first have had to restore to the nation its 
moral weapons, to reinforce its will-power, and to do away with those who 
had destroyed this most valuable element of national strength. 


Just as in 1918 we had to pay with our blood for failure to crush the 
Marxist serpent underfoot once and for all in 1914 and 1915, we have now to 
suffer retribution for the fact that in the spring of 1923, we did not seize the 
opportunity then offered us for finally putting a stop to the mischief being done 
by the Marxist traitors and murderers. 


Any idea of offering real resistance to the French was pure folly as long 
as the fight had not been taken up against those forces which, five years 
previously, had broken German resistance on the battlefields by the influence 
which they exercised at home. 


Only bourgeois minds could have arrived at the ‘incredible conviction 
that Marxism had probably become quite a different thing now and that the 
unprincipled ringleaders of 1918, who callously used the bodies of our two 
million dead as stepping-stones on which they climbed into various 
government positions, would now, in the year 1923, suddenly show themselves 
ready to pay tribute to the national conscience. 


It was veritably a piece of incredible folly to expect that those traitors 
would suddenly appear as the champions of German freedom. 


They had no intention of doing so. Just as a hyena will not abandon its 
carrion, a Marxist will not give up betraying his country. It is beside the point 
to put forward the stupid argument, that so and so many workers gave their 
lives for Germany. That is true, but then they were no longer internationally- 


765 


minded Marxists. 


If, in 1914, the German working class had consisted of real Marxists, the 
War would have ended within three weeks. Germany would have collapsed 
before the first soldier had put a foot beyond the frontier. 


The fact that the German people carried on the War proved that the 
Marxist delusion had not yet penetrated deeply, but as the War dragged on 
German soldiers and workers gradually fell once more under the spell of the 
Marxist leaders, and to the same degree in which they relapsed, their country 
was bereft of their services. If, at the beginning of the War, or even during the 
War, twelve or, fifteen thousand of these Jewish corruptors of the people had 
been forced to submit to poison-gas, just as hundreds of thousands of our best 
German workers from every social class and from every trade and calling had 
to face it in the field, then the millions of sacrifices made at the front would not 
have been made in vain. 


On the contrary, if twelve thousand of these malefactors had been 
eliminated in time, probably the lives of a million decent men, who would 
have been of service to Germany in the future, might have been saved. 


But it was in accordance with bourgeois ‘statesmanship’ to hand over, 
without batting an eyelid, millions of human beings to be slaughtered on the 
battlefield, and to look upon ten or twelve thousand public traitors, profiteers, 
usurers and swindlers, as the nation’s most precious and most sacred asset and 
to publicly proclaim their persons inviolable. 


Indeed it would be hard to, say what is the most outstanding feature of 
these bourgeois circles, mental debility, moral weakness and cowardice, or 
rascally ideology. It is a class that is certainly doomed to go under, but, 
unhappily, it drags down the whole nation with it into the depths. 


The situation in 1923 was similar to that of 1918. No matter what form 
of resistance was decided upon, the first prerequisite for taking action was the 
elimination of the Marxist poison from the body of the nation, and in my 
opinion it was the first task of a really National government to seek and to find 
those forces that were determined to wage a war of annihilation against 
Marxism and to give those forces a free hand. 


It was their duty not to bow down before the fetish of ‘law and order’ at 
a moment when the enemy from without was dealing the Fatherland a death- 


766 


blow and when high treason was lurking at every streetcorner at home. 


A really National government ought then to have welcomed disorder and 
unrest, if this turmoil afforded an opportunity of finally settling with the 
Marxists, who are the mortal enemies of our people. 


This opportunity having been neglected, 1t was sheer folly to think of 
resisting, no matter what form that resistance might take. 


Of course, to settle accounts with the Marxists on a scale which would 
be of genuine historical and universal importance could not be effected along 
lines laid down by some secret council or according to a plan concocted in the 
worn-out brain of some cabinet minister. 


It would have to be in accordance with the eternal laws of life on this 
Earth which are, and will remains those of a ceaseless struggle for existence. 


It must be remembered, that in many instances a hardy and healthy nation 
has emerged from the ordeal of bloody civil war, while from peace conditions 
which had been artificially maintained there often resulted a state of national 
putrescence that reeked to heaven. 


The fate of a nation cannot be altered with the velvet glove and in 1923 
the iron hand should have been used ruthlessly to crush the vipers that battened 
on the body of the nation. Only after this had been done would preparations for 
active resistance have had any point. 


At that time I often talked myself hoarse trying to make clear, at least to 
the so-called national circles, how much was then at stake, and that by 
repeating the errors committed in 1914 and the subsequent years we would 
inevitably meet with the same catastrophe as in 1918. 


I frequently implored them to let Fate have a free hand and to make it 
possible for our Movement to settle with the Marxists, but I preached to deaf 
ears. 


All of them, including the Chief of the Defence Forces, thought they knew 
better, until finally they found themselves forced to subscribe to the vilest 
capitulation in the records of history. 


I then became profoundly convinced that the German bourgeoisie had 
come to the end of its mission and was not capable of fulfilling any further 


767 


function. 


Then, too, I recognised that all the bourgeois parties had been fighting 
Marxism merely out of a spirit of competition without sincerely wishing to 
destroy it. 


They had long ago become reconciled to the idea that their country was 
doomed to destruction and their one care was to secure good seats at the 
funeral banquet. It was for this alone that they kept on ‘fighting.’ 


At that time (I admit it freely) I conceived a profound admiration for the 
great man beyond the Alps, whose ardent love for his people inspired him not 
to bargain with Italy’s internal enemies, but to use every possible means in an 
effort to wipe them out. 


What places Mussolini in the ranks of the world’s great men is his 
decision not to share Italy with the Marxists, but to redeem his country from 
Marxism by destroying internationalism. 


What miserable pygmies our sham statesmen in Germany appear by 
comparison with him! 


How nauseating it is to witness the conceit and effrontery of these 
nonentities in criticising a man who is a thousand times greater than they, and 
how humiliating it is to think that this takes place in a country which as recently 
fifty years ago had a Bismarck for its leader! 


The attitude adopted by the bourgeoisie in 1923 and the way in which 
they dealt kindly with Marxism decided from the outset the fate of any attempt 
at active resistance in the Ruhr. 


With that deadly enemy in our own ranks it was sheer folly to think of 
fighting France. The most that could then be done was to stage a sham fight in 
order to satisfy the German national element to some extent, to tranquillize the 
‘seething indignation of the public,’ or dope it, which was what was really 
intended. 


Had they really believed in what they did, they ought to have recognised 
that the strength of a nation lies, primarily, not in its arms, but in its will, and 
that before setting out to conquer the external enemy, the enemy at home must 
be exterminated; otherwise, disaster must result if victory be not achieved on 
the very first day of the fight. 


768 


The shadow of one defeat is sufficient to break the resistance of a nation 
that has not been liberated from its internal enemies, and give the adversary the 
final victory. 


In the spring of 1923 all this might have been foreseen. It is useless to 
ask whether it was then possible to count on a military success against France, 
for had the result of the German action in regard to the French invasion of the 
Ruhr been only the destruction of Marxism at home, success would have been 
on our side. 


Once liberated from the deadly enemies of her present and future 
existence, Germany would possess forces which no power in the world could 
strangle again. 


On the day when Marxism is broken in Germany, the chains that bind her 
will be smashed for ever, for never in the course of our history have we been 
conquered by the might of our enemies, but only through our own failings and 
the enemy in our own camp. 


Since the German Government of that day were unable to decide on such 
a heroic step, the only alternative left was to house the first course, namely, to 
do nothing and let things slide. 


But, at this crucial moment, Heaven sent Germany a great man in the 
person of Herr Cuno. He was neither a statesman nor a politician by 
profession, still less a born politician, but he was a kind of political office-boy 
who was entrusted with odd jobs. 


Apart from that, he was more of a business-man. It was Germany’s 
misfortune that this politicising business-man looked upon politics in the light 
of business and acted accordingly. 


‘France has occupied the Ruhr. What is there in the Ruhr? Coal. Then 
France has occupied the Ruhr for the sake of its coal!’ 


What was more natural than that Herr Cuno should hit on the idea of a 
strike in order to prevent the French from obtaining coal? 


Then (at least so argued Herr Cuno), they would leave the Ruhr one fine 
day since the occupation had not turned out to be a paying speculation. Such 
were approximately the lines along which that outstanding national statesman 
reasoned. 


769 


At Stuttgart and in other places he addressed ‘his people’ and his people 
were lost in admiration. Of course they needed the Marxists for the strike, 
because the strike had necessarily to be an action undertaken by the workers. 

It was, therefore, essential to bring the worker (who to a bourgeois statesman 
such as Cuno, was one and the same thing as a Marxist) into a united front with 
all other Germans. 


It was wonderful to see how the countenances of these moth-eaten 
bourgeois party politicians beamed with delight when the great genius spoke 
the word of revelation to them. Here was a nationalist and a man of genius. 


At last they had discovered what they had so long sought, for now the 
gulf between Marxism and themselves could be bridged over. Thus it became 
possible for the pseudo-nationalist to play the heavy Teuton to adopt a 
nationalist pose and at the same time to extend the trusty hand of friendship to 
the internationalist traitors of his country. 


The traitors readily grasped that hand, because, just as Herr Cuno had 
need of the Marxist chiefs for his ‘united front,’ the Marxist chiefs needed Herr 
Cuno’s money. Both parties, therefore, benefited by the transaction. 


Cuno obtained his united front, constituted of nationalist chatterboxes 
and anti-national swindlers, and now, with the help of the money paid to them 
by the State, the international imposters were able to pursue their glorious 
mission, which was to destroy the national economic system, this time at the 
expense of the State. 


It was a stroke of genius to think of saving a nation by means of a general 
strike in which the strikers were paid by the State. It was a command that could 
be enthusiastically obeyed by the most indifferent of loafers. 


Everybody knows that prayers will not liberate a nation, but history has 
yet to show whether a nation can be set free by ‘downing tools.’ 


If instead of promoting a paid general strike at that, time, and making this 
the basis of his ‘united front,’ Herr Cuno had demanded two hours more work 
from every German, then the swindle of the ‘united front’ would have been 
over and done with, within three days. 


Nations do not obtain their freedom by refusing to work, but by making 
sacrifices. 


770 


Anyhow, the so-called passive resistance could not last long. Nobody 
but a man entirely ignorant of war could imagine that an army of occupation 
could be frightened and driven out by such ridiculous means, and yet this could 
have been the only purpose of an action for which the country had to pay out 
milliards and which contributed seriously to devaluate the national currency. 


Of course, the French were able to settle down comfortably in the Ruhr 
with an easy mind the moment they saw that such ridiculous measures were 
being adopted against them. 


We ourselves had shown them the best way of bringing a recalcitrant 
civilian population to a sense of reason, if its, conduct implied a serious 
danger to the officials which the army of occupation had placed in authority. 
Nine years previously we had with lightning-like rapidity wiped out bands of 
Belgian francs-tireurs and made the civilian population clearly understand the 
seriousness of the situation, when the activities of these bands threatened grave 
danger to the German Army. 


Similarly, if passive resistance in the Ruhr had really become a menace 
to the French, the armies of occupation would have needed no more than eight 
days to bring the whole piece of childish nonsense to a gruesome end. 


The fundamental question will always be, what are we to do if passive 
resistance reaches a point where it really gets on the nerves of our opponents 
and they proceed to suppress it with force and bloodshed? 


Are we still to resist? If so, then we must, whether we like it or not, 
submit to severe and bloody persecution, and in that case we shall be faced 
with the same situation which we should have had to face, had we offered 
active resistance, in other words, we should have to fight. 


Therefore, so-called passive resistance would be logical only if 
supported by the determination to continue this resistance, if necessary, either 
in an open fight or by means of guerilla warfare. 


Generally speaking, such a struggle is never carried on, except in the 
conviction that success is possible. 


A besieged stronghold, hard pressed by the enemy, surrenders, to all 
practical purposes, at that moment when it is forced to abandon all hope of 
relief, especially if, in such a case, the defenders are attracted by the promise 
of life instead of probable death. 


77) 


Let the garrison of a citadel which has been completely encircled by the 
enemy once lose all hope of deliverance, and the spirit of the defenders is 
broken immediately. 


That is why, if one considers the consequences to which it must 
inevitably have led, if it was to prove successful, passive resistance in the 
Ruhr had no practical meaning unless an active front had been organised to 
support it. 


In that case a tremendous effort might have been demanded of our nation. 
If all the Westphalians in the Ruhr could have been assured that the home 
country had mobilised an army of eighty or a hundred divisions to support 
them, the French would have found themselves treading on thorns. 


Surely a greater number of courageous men could have been found to 
sacrifice themselves for a successful enterprise than for an enterprise that was 
manifestly futile. 


This was the classic occasion that induced us National Socialists to take 
up a resolute stand against the so-called national battle-cry. 


During those months I was attacked by people whose patriotism was a 
mixture of stupidity and humbug and who took part in the general hue and cry 
because of the pleasant sensation they felt at being suddenly enabled to show 
themselves as nationalists, without thereby incurring any danger. In my 
estimation, this despicable united front was one of the most ridiculous 
phenomena imaginable, and events proved that I was right. As soon as the 
trade-unions had nearly filled their treasuries with Cuno’s contributions, and 
the moment had come for passive resistance to change over from inert defence 
to active aggression, the ‘Red’ hyenas suddenly broke out of the national 
sheepfold and appeared in their true light. 


Silently, Herr Cuno stole back to his business. Germany was richer by 
one experience and poorer by the loss of one great hope. 


Up to midsummer of that year several officers, who certainly were not 
the least brave and honourable of their kind, had not really believed that the 
course of things could take a turn that wits so humiliating. 


They had all hoped that—if not openly, then at least secretly—the 
necessary measures would be taken to make this insolent French invasion a 
turning-point in German history. 


yap 


In our ranks also there were many who counted on the intervention of the 
Reich Army. That conviction was so ardent that it exerted a decisive influence 
on the conduct and especially on the training of innumerable young men. 


But when the disgraceful collapse actually took place, and, after millions 
of German money had been spent in vain and thousands of young Germans who 
had been foolish enough to trust in the promises made by the rulers of the Reich 
had been sacrificed, the Government capitulated in the most humiliating way, 
public indignation at such a betrayal of our unhappy nation blazed forth. 


Millions, of people now became fully convinced that Germany could be 
saved only if the whole prevailing system were destroyed root and branch. 


There never had been a more propitious moment for such a solution. On 
the one hand, an act of high treason had been committed against the country, 
openly and shamelessly. 


On the other, a nation was, economically speaking, delivered over to 
slow starvation. Since the State itself had trampled upon all precepts of faith 
and loyalty, made a mockery of the rights of its citizens, rendered the sacrifice 
of millions of its most loyal sons fruitless and robbed other millions of their 
last penny, it could no longer expect anything but hatred from its subjects. 


This hatred against those who had ruined the people and the country was 
bound to find an outlet in one form or another. 


In this connection I quote here the concluding sentence of a speech which 
I delivered at the great trial that took place in the spring of 1924. 


“Let the judges of this State condemn us for our conduct at that time; 
History, the goddess of a higher truth and a finer justice, will smile as she tears 
up their verdict and will acquit us of all guilt.” 


But History will then also summon before its own tribunal, those who, 
invested with power, have trampled on law and justice, condemning our 
people to misery and ruin, and who, in the hour of their country’s misfortune, 
took more account of their own ego than of the life of the community. 


I shall not here relate the history of the events leading up to November 
8th, 1923, and ending with that date. I shall not do so, because I cannot see that 
this would serve any beneficial purpose in the future and also because no good 
could come of opening old sores that have only just healed. 


773 


Moreover, it would be out of place to talk about the guilt of men who, 
perhaps in the depths of their hearts, loved their people equally well and who 
merely failed to take the same path or did not recognise it as the right one to 
take. 


In the face of the great misfortune which has befallen our Fatherland and 
which affects us all, I must abstain from offending and perhaps disuniting those 
men who must, at some future date, form one great united front which will be 
made up of true and loyal Germans and which will have to withstand the 
common front presented by the enemy of our people. 


For I know that a time will come when those who then treated us as 
enemies will venerate the men who trod the bitter way of death for the sake of 
their people. 


I have dedicated the first volume of this book to our eighteen fallen 
heroes. 


Here, at the end of this second volume, let me again, before the adherents 
and champions of our ideals, evoke the memory of those men as heroes who, in 
the full consciousness of what they were doing, sacrificed their lives for us all. 


They must always recall the weak and wavering to a sense of their duty- 
that same duty which they themselves fulfilled loyally even to the making of the 
supreme sacrifice. 


I regard as one of their number that man who, as one of the best among 
us, devoted his life, in his works, in his philosophy and finally in action, to 
awakening the nation that was his and ours. 


That man was DIETRICH ECKART.

EPILOGUE 


On November 9, 1923, in the fourth year of its existence, the National 
Socialist German Workers’ Party was dissolved and prohibited in the whole 
Reich territory. Today, in November, 1926, it stands again free before us, 
stronger and inwardly firmer than ever before. 


All the persecutions of the movement and its individual leaders, all 
vilifications and slanders, were powerless to harm it. The correctness of its 
ideas, the purity of its will, its supporters’ spirit of self-sacrifice, have caused 
it to issue from all repressions strong than ever. 


If, in the world of our present parliamentary corruption, it becomes more 
and more aware of the profoundest essence of its struggle, feels itself to be the 
purest embodiment of the value of race and personality and conducts itself 
accordingly, it will with almost mathematical certainty some day emerge 
victorious from its struggle. 


Just as Germany must inevitably win her rightful position on this earth if 
she is led and organized according to the same principles. 


A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to the care 
of its best racial elements must some day become lord of the earth. 


May the adherents of our movement never forget this if ever the 
magnitude of the sacrifices should beguile them to an anxious comparison with 
the possible results.
