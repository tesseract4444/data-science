president bush address nation position federal funding stem cell research bush ranch crawford texas good evening appreciate giving minute time tonight discus complex difficult issue issue one profound time issue research involving stem cell derived human embryo increasingly subject national debate dinner table discussion issue confronted every day laboratory scientist ponder ethical ramification work agonized parent many couple try child save child already born issue debated within church people different faith even many faith coming different conclusion many people finding know stem cell research le certain right ethical moral conclusion administration must decide whether allow federal fund tax dollar used scientific research stem cell derived human embryo large number embryo already exist product process called vitro fertilization help many couple conceive child doctor match sperm egg create life outside womb usually produce embryo planted mother couple successfully child unsuccessful additional embryo remain frozen laboratory survive long storage others destroyed number donated science used create privately funded stem cell line implanted adoptive mother born today healthy child based preliminary work privately funded scientist believe research using stem cell offer great promise could help improve life suffer many terrible disease juvenile diabetes alzheimers parkinson spinal cord injury scientist admit yet certain believe stem cell derived embryo unique potential also know stem cell derived source embryo adult cell umbilical cord discarded baby born human placenta many scientist feel research type stem cell also promising many patient suffering range disease already helped treatment developed adult stem cell however scientist least today believe research embryonic stem cell offer promise cell potential develop tissue body scientist believe rapid progress research come federal fund federal dollar help attract best brightest scientist ensure new discovery widely shared largest number research facility research directed toward greatest public good united state long proud record leading world toward advance science medicine improve human life united state long proud record upholding highest standard ethic expand limit science knowledge research embryonic stem cell raise profound ethical question extracting stem cell destroys embryo thus destroys potential life like snowflake embryo unique unique genetic potential individual human thought issue kept returning two fundamental question first frozen embryo human life therefore something precious protected second theyre going destroyed anyway shouldnt used greater good research potential save improve life ive asked question others scientist scholar bioethicists religious leader doctor researcher member congress cabinet friend read heartfelt letter many american given issue great deal thought prayer considerable reflection found widespread disagreement first issue embryo human life well one researcher told belief fivedayold cluster cell embryo yet individual preembryo argued potential life life cannot develop ethicist dismissed callous attempt rationalization make mistake told cluster cell way rest u started life one go heavy heart use said dealing seed next generation crucial question going destroyed anyway use good purpose also found different answer many argue embryo byproduct process help create life allow couple donate science used good purpose instead wasting potential others argue there thing excess life fact living going die justify experimenting exploiting natural resource core issue force u confront fundamental question beginning life end science lie difficult moral intersection juxtaposing need protect life phase prospect saving improving life stage discovery modern science create tremendous hope also lay vast ethical mine field genius science extends horizon increasingly confront complex question arrived brave new world seemed distant aldous huxley wrote human being created test tube called hatchery recent week learned scientist created human embryo test tube solely experiment deeply troubling warning sign prompt u think issue carefully embryonic stem cell research leading edge series moral hazard initial stem cell researcher first reluctant begin research fearing might used human cloning scientist already cloned sheep researcher telling u next step could clone human being create individual designer stem cell essentially grow another available case need another heart lung liver strongly oppose human cloning american recoil idea growing human being spare body part creating life convenience must devote enormous energy conquering disease equally important pay attention moral concern raised new frontier human embryo stem cell research even noble end justify mean position issue shaped deeply held belief im strong supporter science technology believe potential incredible good improve life save life conquer disease research offer hope million loved one may cured disease rid suffering friend whose child suffer juvenile diabetes nancy reagan written president reagan struggle alzheimers family confronted tragedy childhood leukemia like american great hope cure also believe human life sacred gift creator worry culture devalues life believe president important obligation foster encourage respect life america throughout world hopeful potential research one certain science live hope generated eight year ago scientist believed fetal tissue research offered great hope cure treatment yet progress date lived initial expectation embryonic stem cell research offer great promise great peril decided must proceed great care result private research genetically diverse stem cell line already exist created embryo already destroyed ability regenerate indefinitely creating ongoing opportunity research concluded allow federal fund used research existing stem cell line life death decision already made leading scientist tell research line great promise could lead breakthrough therapy cure allows u explore promise potential stem cell research without crossing fundamental moral line providing taxpayer funding would sanction encourage destruction human embryo least potential life also believe great scientific progress made aggressive federal funding research umbilical cord placenta adult animal stem cell involve moral dilemma year government spend million important research also name president council monitor stem cell research recommend appropriate guideline regulation consider medical ethical ramification biomedical innovation council consist leading scientist doctor ethicist lawyer theologian others chaired dr leon ka leading biomedical ethicist university chicago council keep u apprised new development give nation forum continue discus evaluate important issue go forward hope always guided intellect heart capability conscience made decision great care pray right one thank listening good night god bless america
