east room white house president bush clarifies balanced approach stem cell research context two bill subject passed congress good afternoon congress passed sent desk two bill concerning use stem cell biomedical research bill illustrate promise peril face age biotechnology new era challenge harness power science ease human suffering without sanctioning practice violate dignity human life applause spoke american people set forth new policy stem cell research struck balance need science demand conscience took office federal funding human embryonic stem cell research policy announced five year ago administration became first make federal fund available research yet embryonic stem cell line derived embryo already destroyed administration made available million research line policy allowed important research go forward without using taxpayer fund encourage deliberate destruction human embryo one bill congress passed build progress made last five year signed law applause congress also passed second bill attempt overturn balanced policy set bill would support taking innocent human life hope finding medical benefit others cross moral boundary decent society need respect vetoed applause like american believe nation must vigorously pursue tremendous possibility science offer cure disease improve life million opportunity discover cure treatment unthinkable generation ago scientist believe one source cure might embryonic stem cell research embryonic stem cell ability grow specialized adult tissue may give potential replace damaged defective cell body part treat variety disease yet must also remember embryonic stem cell come human embryo destroyed cell human embryo unique human life inherent dignity matchless value see value child u today child began life frozen embryo created vitro fertilization remained unused fertility treatment complete child adopted still embryo blessed chance grow loving family boy girl spare part applause remind u lost embryo destroyed name research remind u begin life small collection cell remind u zeal new treatment cure america must never abandon fundamental moral people argue finding new cure disease requires destruction human embryo like one family adopted disagree believe right technique right policy achieve scientific progress living ethical responsibility thats sought set forth administration policy allowing federal funding research embryonic stem cell line life death decision already made balanced approach worked policy human embryonic stem cell line currently use research eligible federal funding line replicated many time result national institute health helped make shipment researcher since ban embryonic stem cell research contrary even critic policy concede federally funded line used research every day scientist around world policy allowed u explore potential embryonic stem cell allowed america continue lead world area since announced policy advance scientific research also shown great potential stem cell derived without harming human embryo administration expanded funding research stem cell drawn child adult blood umbilical cord harm donor stem cell already used medical treatment u today patient benefited treatment adult umbilicalcordblood stem cell want thank coming applause living proof effective medical science also ethical researcher also investigating new technique could allow doctor scientist produce stem cell versatile derived human embryo one technique scientist exploring would involve reprogramming adult cell example skin cell function like embryonic stem cell science offer hope may one day enjoy potential benefit embryonic stem cell without destroying human life must continue explore hopeful alternative advance cause scientific research staying true ideal decent humane society bill sign today upholds humane ideal draw important ethical line guide research fetus farming prohibition act sponsored senator santorum brownback applause congressman dave weldon along nathan deal thank congressman applause good law prohibits one egregious abuse biomedical research trafficking human fetus created sole intent aborting harvest part human being raw material exploited commodity bought sold bill help ensure respect fundamental ethical line im disappointed congress failed pas another bill would promoted good research bill sponsored senator santorum senator arlen specter congressman roscoe bartlett thanks coming roscoe applause would authorized additional federal funding promising new research could produce cell ability embryonic cell without destruction human embryo important piece legislation bill unanimously approved senate received vote house representative blocked minority house using procedural maneuver im disappointed house failed authorize funding vital ethical research make sense say youre favor finding cure terrible disease quickly possible block bill would authorize funding promising ethical stem cell research moment ethical alternative becoming available cannot lose opportunity conduct research would give hope suffering terrible disease help move nation beyond current controversy embryonic stem cell research must pursue research direct secretary health human service secretary leavitt director national institute health use tool disposal aid search stem cell technique advance promising medical science ethical morally responsible way applause unfortunately congress sent bill fails meet ethical test legislation would overturn balanced policy embryonic stem cell research administration followed past five year bill would also undermine principle congress followed decade prohibited federal funding research destroys human embryo bill would become law american taxpayer would first time history compelled fund deliberate destruction human embryo im going allow applause made clear congress allow nation cross moral line felt like crossing line would mistake crossed would find almost impossible turn back crossing line would needlessly encourage conflict science ethic damage nation whole find right way advance ethical medical research must also willing necessary reject wrong way today im keeping promise made american people returning bill congress veto science brings u ever closer unlocking secret human biology also offer temptation manipulate human life violate human dignity conscience history nation demand resist temptation america founded principle created equal endowed creator right life advance cause science upholding founding promise harness promise technology without becoming slave technology ensure science serf cause humanity instead way around america pursues medical advance name life achieve great breakthrough seek reverence gift life believe america scientist ingenuity
