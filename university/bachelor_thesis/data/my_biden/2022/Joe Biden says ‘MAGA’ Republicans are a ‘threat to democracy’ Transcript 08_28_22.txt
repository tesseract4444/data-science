Joe Biden: (00:21)
The MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and economic security. They’re a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace, embrace political violence. They don’t believe in democracy. This is why in this moment, those of you who love this country, Democrats, Independents, Mainstream Republicans, we must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving America than the MAGA Republicans are destroying America.

The rally kicks off a coast to coast tour for Biden, as he tries to lend support to Democrats and stop Republicans from taking control of Congress, in part by emphasizing stark differences between the parties and to tout recent legislative victories on climate change and gun control. Republicans hope they can ride voters’ unhappiness with high inflation, as well as cultural resentment from the party’s majority white base. They also have a historical advantage, as the party in control of the White House usually loses seats in their first midterms.

Democratic pollsters said Biden is polling lower than most, if not all of the actual Democratic candidates running for competitive seats in Congress, often by double digits. His latest approval rating is 41%.
