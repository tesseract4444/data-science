It’s an honor and a pleasure to welcome President Zelensky to the White House, to the Oval Office.

As we celebrate 30 years of Ukrainian independence, the partnership between foundations goes stronger and it’s going to even become stronger than it has been.

Ukraine and the United States have a similar value system and the strong commitment to the fulfillment of a promise that we hope all will come forward, and that is a Europe whole, free, and at peace.

And the United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and, and our support for Ukraine’s Euro Atlantic aspirations.

Today, we’re going to discuss how the U.S. can continue to support Ukraine as it advances its democratic reforms agenda and moment toward it completely integrated in Europe.

We’re revitalizing the Strategic Partnership Commission between our nations, and we’re also creating a new strategic defense framework and a new $60 million security systems package.

As well as a new energy and climate dialogue to help Ukraine diversify its energy supplies while supporting our climate goals relating to global warming.

And of course, we’ll talk about our ongoing fight against COVID-19 and the United States has donated 2.2 million vaccines to Ukraine through COVAX, and we’re going to continue to work to provide more as well.

We have much to talk about, and I still remember the opportunity that I had to speak to Volodymyr years ago, and I look forward to being able to come back someday to see you.

Mr President.

Thank you. We have much to talk about.

Thank you all very much.
