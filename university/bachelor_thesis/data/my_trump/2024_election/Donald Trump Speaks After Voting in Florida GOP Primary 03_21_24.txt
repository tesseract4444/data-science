Speaker 1 (00:15):

Mr. President, will you pardon Peter Navarro?

Donald Trump (00:20):

He’s a good man. He was treated very unfairly. Peter was treated very unfairly. A great patriot. A great negotiator for our country. He did a tremendous job with respect to China and trade, and they treated him very badly. The Biden Administration treated him very, very badly. It’s a shame, but that’s the way it is. They treated him very, very badly.

Speaker 1 (00:42):

Will Paul Manafort come back to your campaign, sir?

Donald Trump (00:44):

I don’t know anything about it, but he was another person that was treated badly, and he was a patriot. But we’ll see what happens with that. We have a lot of people involved in the campaign. They’ve done a tremendous job, and based on the polls, we’re doing extremely well. Extremely well.

Speaker 3 (01:03):

Mrs. Trump, are you going to return to the campaign trail with your husband?

Melania Trump (01:08):

Stay tuned.

Speaker 3 (01:08):

Stay tuned?

Speaker 4 (01:09):

Are you confident that you can pay the court’s $64 million?

Donald Trump (01:13):

I built a great company, one of the greatest companies anywhere in the country, especially when it comes to real estate. Have some of the greatest assets in the world. And this is a rigged trial. This was a rigged trial by a crooked judge and a crooked attorney general. And we’re fighting an algorithm. We have a lot of cash and we have a great company but they want to take it away, or at least take the cash element away. Billions of dollars in value, billions of dollars in properties, but they’d like to take the cash away so I can’t use it on the campaign. And this is just a corrupt group of people. It’s election interference. And we’ll see how the courts rule on it. And I’ll be guided-

Speaker 5 (01:49):

President Trump, do you think Jewish people who vote Democrat hate their religions?

Donald Trump (01:50):

I’ll be guided… Excuse me. I’ll be guided by the courts.

Speaker 5 (01:54):

President Trump, do you think Jewish people who vote Democrat hate their religion? Do you think Jewish people who vote Democrat hate their religion?

Donald Trump (02:00):

I think that the Democrats have been very, very opposed to Jewish people, that’s true, and to Israel. All you have to do is look at Senator Schumer. What he did with Israel is a disgrace, and I think Israel will probably not forget it very soon. It’s a very sad situation.

Speaker 6 (02:18):

Do you think a 16 week abortion ban is smart?

Speaker 7 (02:18):

What’s your reaction to Vice President Pence saying he can’t endorse you?

Donald Trump (02:18):

Say what?

Speaker 7 (02:18):

What’s your reaction to Vice President Pence saying that he can’t endorse you?

Donald Trump (02:24):

Oh, I couldn’t care less. I couldn’t care less.

Speaker 8 (02:26):

Mrs. Trump [inaudible 00:02:27].

Donald Trump (02:26):

We need Patriots. We need strong people in our country. Our country’s going downhill very fast, very rapidly. Millions of people coming across the border, coming from jails, from prisons, coming from mental institutions and insane asylums, terrorists. We need strong people in this country. We don’t need weak people.

Speaker 6 (02:44):

Do you think a 16 week abortion ban is smart?

Donald Trump (02:46):

We’ll be talking about that soon.

Speaker 6 (02:48):

How soon?

Donald Trump (02:48):

We’ll be talking about it very soon.

Speaker 9 (02:50):

Are you [inaudible 00:02:51] Jewish voters, Mr. President?

Donald Trump (02:53):

Well, we’re doing very well with the Jewish voter, it looks like, and we should do very well. If you look at all of our presidents, they’re saying Trump was the best for Israel, by far the best for Israel. And we’re doing very well with the Jewish voters. You can see in the polls.

Speaker 10 (03:08):

[inaudible 00:03:08]. Do you think the Biden administrations should continue…. Do you-

Speaker 11 (03:08):

Would you use the Insurrection Act to close the border [inaudible 00:03:15]?

Donald Trump (03:15):

They have to close the borders. Our country is dying. Our country is being overridden. This is an invasion. Our country is being invaded by people nobody even knows who they are, where they come from. Millions of people. I predict 15 million people within a short period of time. Probably have 15 million people already. That’s bigger than most states. And these people come from the wrong places. They’re coming from very bad places. There’s no checks. There’s no balances. It’s a disgrace. What’s happening to our country is a disgrace. We have to close the border. Let people come in, but they have to come in legally.
