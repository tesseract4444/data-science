in this room and who's a veteran raise your hand please a lot of veterans up here and every proud veteran across the great state of New Hampshire very very proud of uh of your heritage of your state and of uh your military tremendous uh I think proportionately as many in New Hampshire maybe more than any other state we're also honored to be joined by the Goldstar family members of Marines who lost their lives in the Afghanistan stand horrible horrible withdrawal I got to know the the parents and the relatives of so many of them and they're incredible people we spent an evening in Bedminster listening to music right we listen to music oh there they are we had a good time I said I'll be with them maybe 15 or 20 minutes we spent about 3 hours together right looking up in the sky and seeing some beautiful signals coming down right the father of staff sergeant Taylor Hoover Darren Hoover where are you you're here some yeah there you are thank you very much thank you very much

and we finished the evening and it was a beautiful beautiful tribute to them not to us to them right so thank you very much we'll do it again we'll do it again and we love you all and we will never forget the sacrifice of Taylor and Nicole and Kareem and the others and uh incredible what happened you don't take the military out first you take the military out last right and and about 10 other things that we could name you don't give up bogram and you leave from bogram not from the place they left from couldn't breathe it was so tight so crazy so horrible what they did the veterans who have served this nation in uniform enlisted their lives lives defense of their families our freedom and our Great American flag and when I'm back in the white house we're all going back together they will once again have the Loyalty the respect and the support that they earned and they so dearly deserve after years of Scandal betrayal and nect under the Obama Biden Administration I signed the VA accountability act they were trying to get it done for 59 years and we got it done through Congress believe it or not so they can't cancel it out right away allowing us to tell the sadists and people that didn't work and people that didn't love our are are wounded and are injured and are hurt they were uh terrible they would treat them terribly and you couldn't do a damn thing about it they'd be in there and they were sadus they had people this wasn't prime time for our people and they weren't able to defend themselves they had people that would really mistreat our veterans and uh we couldn't do a thing about it because of the laws civil service and otherwise you couldn't do a thing they could be as bad as they wanted they could do everything up to murder and the way they treated some of these people were just horrible people you couldn't fire them and now we looked at them and we took about 7,000 of them and we said you're fired get out get out out that was a big thing and by the way I don't know if you know it but Biden wants to put them all back can you believe it and these were the bad ones these were the bad ones we don't want to do that we don't want to fire replac them with great people they want to put them all back all those people that are sickos they want to put them all back I also signed about 59 years they've been trying to get this one VA Choice which made it permanent so that the veterans can get medical care at the Private health care provider of their choice so that you go in and you go in and you want to you're not feeling well and you know many people became terminally ill waiting they'd wait for 2 weeks 2 months 3 months four months 5 months six seven months and by the time they got to see the doctor they were terminally ill they could have been taken care of very quickly very easily you know preventative care the best thing about that is get it early they got it early but when they got to the doctor it would be many months and many cases so if you waited more than one day we let you go to a private doctor any private doctor we paid the cost we negotiated with them we had fixed prices they said because those doctors they know how to make money don't they some of them are are money machines and some are just really good doctors and really love everyone in this room and all of your relatives and what happened is uh we made a deal that nobody said could be made and we got it passed in Congress believe it or not the Republican Congress did a great job with both of these the accountability and this and now you go and if you have to wait online for more than a day you go to a private doctor you pick the private doctor and they take care of you and you live and believe it or not not that this was why I did it because it wasn't but you save a lot of money it's actually a lot cheaper than letting somebody get sicker and sicker and just uh end up dying a horrible death and people that were pretty sick but not that bad or better and it's been an incredible system I understand they're trying to dismantle it under the Biden Administration and you would know better than I but they're trying to dismantle that under the Biden Administration but under the Trump Administration we live by the motto promises made Promises Kept I made that promise and there is no more solemn pledge than a promise to America's veterans the veterans are incredible people so many people in this room unfortunately with crooked Joe Biden in the White House our veterans are once again being backstabbed and betrayed by their government crooked Joe gutted our historic VA reforms and fought to reinstate thousands and thousands as I just said of uh fired horrible employees these are horrible employees that when we terminated them uh we said get out of here and they got out but now they have a little bit of a Lobby going and they even want back pay they treated our veterans badly and it looks like it's going to cost up to $200 million in back pay for people that were treating our veterans badly but instead of wasting $200 million on the worst VA employees and and when I say bad they're bad when I'm president I'll ask Congress to take up every penny of that money and add some to it because we're going to build in your great state a brand new beautiful VA Hospital right here in New Hampshire we're going to build it we're going to build the most beautiful hospital and it's going to be uh you know you you're just about I hate to say this you're just about the only state that doesn't have a VA hospital but us is going to be better and better than any of them we'll I'll get involved in the real estate World we'll start looking at the corners and we'll say We'll build a better one for half the price better than anybody but you'll have it and that's already on the drawing board you can end up with your own Hospital which you really need TR people have to travel for hundreds of miles to go and get to a hospital a VA hospital I'll also make it a personal mission to completely eradicate veterans homelessness in [Music] America you know we were doing a great job with it and then a terrible thing happened we were doing so well with it and then these guys get in and uh they treat the illegal aliens just poor pouring pouring into our country better than they treat our veterans I [Music] mean they stay in the best hotels I don't even stay in those hotels I say don't stay there that I tell my people don't stay there they to expensive they say we can serve them being occupied by illegal aliens those owners are making a lot of money but it's it's just crazy we don't treat the veterans we don't treat our veterans right in the past three years Biden has over1 billion to put up illegal aliens and hotels some of the most luxurious hotels in the country meanwhile we have 33,000 homeless American veterans can you believe it and we were really alleviating that problem and now they've given that totally up totally up it's terrible when day one I'll signed an executive order to cut off Biden's spigot of money for the shelter and transport of illegal aliens and we will redirect a large portion of the savings to provide shelter and treatment for our own homeless veterans we love our veterans we got to take care of our veterans here they're among our greatest people crooked Joe puts bureaucrats first at illegal aliens first I will put veterans first and America First every single time in addition to being veteran day today is also Armistice Day did you know that Armistice Day and this is an incredible number when you hear these numbers but the anniversary of the end of World War I a conflict that wrecked the entire world really I inan large parts of the entire world and killed over 20 million people did you know that 20 million people 20 million people and think of it we have a guy in the White House who can't put two cent sentences together who couldn't find his way off this stage and actually he would be confused because I think my audience behind me might be bigger than my audience in front of me he would be saying he'd be saying what do I do where am I he'd be saying this strange speaking venue I'm like in the middle of a room and I'm looking back here but he would say what's this you ever see he ends a speech he has no clue how to get off you got to stare there you got to jump off the front do anything just don't walk into a wall he walks into walls but this is the guy that we have NE negotiating with Putin and right and president she of China and Kim Jong-un who won't even talk to him this is who we have in charge of nuclear but this anniversary should remind us all of why it is so important to once again have a president who will deliver peace through strength that's what we had we had tremendous we had all peace we had we had peace we had a great we had a great period of time World War III has never been closer in my opinion than it is right now and it wasn't at all close we were never going to have it 3 years ago we had uh we had everything under perfect control uh Russia was treating us with respect they would have never ever gone into Ukraine China would have never been talking about Taiwan I mean we had this the whole thing was going really good you know if you ask me when he pulled out the way he pulled out of Afghanistan Putin wouldn't have done it anyway but the way he pulled out of Afghanistan it said let's go and you know everyone lost respect we pulled out as cowards it was a surrender it was truly a surrender we gave up $85 billion worth of equipment these 13 great lives and we had 38 people were obliterated 38 they don't talk about them they never talk about them uh Missing legs one case two legs one arm and a half an arm and just just obliterated and nobody mentions the poor people should never happen should have never happened the people in the front row that I've gotten to know incredible families just torn apart by gross incompetence and uh I tell you it's so sad to see would have been so easy we had we had something going we called up the head of the Taliban I told the story to you but I called up the head of the Taliban I said the Press got on me for that look at all the Press oh it's so nice the fake news fake news fake news but I spoke to the head of the Taliban Abdul then I told him Abdul you can't do this you can you keep shooting us so they killed a lot of a lot of soldier snipers during the Obama SL Biden I don't know did they ever call them uh but they killed a lot of people with the snipers a lot of people period and I said can't do it anyway since I I had a rough conversation with him since that conversation we didn't lose one 18 months it was we didn't lose one soldier there wasn't one soldier shot at 18 months even Biden admitted that he said well I will say one thing under the Trump policy they didn't lose any Soldier when he said that his people went crazy don't say that why but he did say that once so I think we have to we'll have to wheel out we'll have to wheel out that statement but it's true I look for 18 months think of it 18 months we didn't lose one soldier and then we had a rigged election and then uh the result was exactly that by the way Hillary's allowed to say things about elections and every democrat's allowed to say but if we say it we get indicted they indict us if we say and in our case it was true it was a rigged election was stolen and because of that we have unhappy people in the front row and we have lot of other unhappy people because of that we have inflation and we have high taxes and we have high interest rates and you can't buy a home and you can't refinance your home and you can't sell your home and you have energy at the highest level it's ever been you were energy independent three years ago you had $187 a gallon gasoline and now you have $5 gasoline but I stand before you today as the the only candidate in either party who can make this promise I will prevent 100% prevent World War III you're going to end up you're going to end up in World War I you look at what's going on right now in the Middle East and Ukraine and you add it up and we have somebody that has no clue what the hell is going on you're going to end up in World War II because of this no reason for it millions of people will die I know the players I know the job I alone in this primary have borne the burden of having troops In Harm's Way as commander and chief of the US armed forces and the Neons globalists and warmongers and the race they like to talk to oh we're going to go here we're going to go there millions of people die and we didn't do that yet we knock the hell out of Isis you know I defeated Isis totally and brought them back but these people are way over their head Biden is over the head I mean Biden in all fairness to the Republican candidates Biden if you call that look what kind of a candidate they're losing by like 60 70 points each even they agree I shouldn't go to the debates I mean the other day two of them said well if I was in his position I don't think I'd debate either but how about a how about this guy ASA Hutchinson right he's been at zero for the last three months now do you think he's going to surge to 90 he I call him aah aah aah Hutson no no he's been at zero zero for the last three months he didn't make the last debate because he had zero how about that you have a large population voting he got absolutely no votes so he gets no votes and he says and today I just heard his campaign manager quit why did he quit because I've been telling the guy to quit and he won't won't quit I think this if he ever made it it would be the single greatest comeback in the history of politics or any other event you could say politics or any other event if he made it if he made it only because he'd be the only one left on Earth gu and he's a nasty guy you know he talks like he's terrible he's a lousy governor too to me peace through strength is not just a political slogan it's actually a moral duty and it's my commitment to you the American people but you will not have World War II you know we were respected when I was President we were respected by China you know one story a quick story you don't mind if I go off teleprompter like a lot do you so much more exciting so much more but the head of hungry a very tough strong guy Victor Orban did anybody ever hear of a probably you know considered very powerful very uh powerful within his country and outside of his country not exactly loved by some of the European nations because he does his thing he didn't allow millions of people to invade his country he allowed nobody to invade the zero zero he had nobody so he doesn't have crime and he doesn't have the problems that they're having in other countries with millions of people who were allowed to go in but they were interviewing him two weeks ago and they said what would you ad VI President Obama the whole world seems to be exploding and imploding and he said it's very simple he should immediately resign and they should replace him with President Trump who kept the world safe and I'm not just talking the United States China respected him Russia respected him North Korea respected him and he used another word other than respect to he said fear but I don't want to use that word of course it's probably better than respect if you get right down to it right but he said everybody was fine we had no we have none of these problems you didn't have inflation you didn't have these problems three years ago and then you look at this we had the greatest economy in history and now we have a mess you'll end up in the Great Depression and I'll tell you the one thing I don't want to be I don't want to be Herbert Hoover I always said I don't want to be Herbert Hoover and the way they're going with their stupid energy policies you know you pay the highest in this state you pay the highest energy costs anywhere in the United States you know that you had to talk to your Governor about that you ought to talk to your governor who who right now I don't think he could be elected dog catcher here's a guy here's a guy and you may have a couple of fans but I doubt it here's a guy could have been a senator would have been greatly helpful if he could have been he's got the heritage of the name he used to like his father his father used to treat me very nice he was actually Nast nasty and then when I won he was he went from one of the worst to one of the best when I won his father was great before that he was nasty you know he was a bush guy I mean one of those things they tend to be a little bit bad don't get a lot of the right things done but his father was very very good to me and this guy he could have been a senator but he you know he ran for president right he just didn't have the guts to announce it he ran for president and he was mired at 1% for a few months making really nasty he's a nasty guy making nasty comments and then he decided that he wasn't going to run so he said well I decided not to run well he ran for like four months he was running but again it takes courage you know say what you want about these other people some of them shouldn't be running because it's a joke but but you know say what you want about them it takes courage to run it does it takes courage it's not an easy thing to do but this guy could have been a senator would have made a tremendous difference and said they lost that that race by very close race uh but they lost that race but he could have been so easy it could have been there cuz he's not presidential material and he could have been there for a long time and it would have made a big difference in the Senate but he didn't do that and people have to get the Republican party they have to get unified and they have to get smart they have to get smart CU say what you want about the Democrats they have horrible policy you know let's have open borders where millions and millions of people come in illegally into our country from prisons and from mental institutions and terrorists think of their policies all electric cars they don't go far you know where you can you can't get out of New Hampshire in an electric car where you going I'm going to massachusett well you better get yourself a gas turbine because this car is not going to get you there well you could if you stop about four times now I want to go to Massachusetts darling I'm sorry you can't do it you about you know 12 miles away the whole thing is crazy you know they want to also we have a little time you know this is a nice day you you screwed up my whole day by putting this in the middle of the day so you can't do anything in the morning CU you don't have time you can't do anything in the even although tonight I'm going to the UFC fight at Madison sport Dana White you know Dana White the great Dana White there's a guy I'd like to make my defense Chief I wouldn't call him my defense Chief I'd call him my offense Chief he'd be my offense Chief but he's done a great job but no I'm going there tonight so uh at least you left me enough time for that but you know it's really a tribute here we are on a beautiful day beautiful day in New Hampshire and you have a crowd and you have thousands of people outside that couldn't get in I said did you put up a screen for them they said no now you don't care about that but they do okay you got the better Real Estate but as president I will restore American strength power and Prestige and I will make your a country safe I will be The Peacemaker you know The Peacemaker is okay Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton during one of the debates she said look at him look at him he's a war Monger she's the one that always wanted War it's the strangest people want war you look at her what the hell's War I remember when LeBron James endorser it was the greatest endorsement I've ever seen because he got on stage and she got up and she was like here around here and I said that's not looking good that's not looking good I love that endorsement she can have them under Biden or adversar see the weakness and the foolishness of America's leaders the stupidity actually and uh you know like this whole electric car mandate can you believe it that the cars they're too expensive I say very very easily defined it's so simple though I said let's do a little bit more sophistication uh they're too expensive and they don't go far what else can you say you know it's true when President she sits across the table from crooked joil can you imagine president she is like Central Casting there's nobody in Hollywood that can play the role of President she the look the strength The Voice we will begin immediately negotiation and I say I say loose it up I say loose it up I had a great relationship with him until Co then I said that's the end of that but I did it's good to have a good relationship with Putin and she and all these people they have lots of nuclear weapons and Kim Jong-un had a good relationship with he's a tough smart guy you know when I call these people smart the Press always says he said he was smart I'm supposed to say they're not intelligent people presiden she and China controls 1.4 billion people within iron hand no drug problems you know why they have no drug problems death penalty for the drug dealers death penalty right you want to solve your drug problem you have to Institute a meaningful death penalty for drug deal a drug dealer and you by the way you have it worse than any other state proportionately I don't understand New Hampshire for whatever reason you have a worse drug problem per capita than any other state nobody's explained that maybe you to talk to the governor about that also by the way why is that you have the worst drug problem per capita in the entire nation you have an unbelievable fire department and police department they do such a good job they spend most of their time saving people from overdoses and other things your police here and your fire here are incredible I have to tell you I met a lot of them backstage I said uh you know they spent spend a lot of their time they spent almost most of their time on that but they're they're incredible the job yeah you to talk to your Governor about that because that's something that uh something should happen but you want to really stop it you know when I was in the white house I would set up uh Blue Ribbon committees and I'd get socializes everybody wanted to be on committees right you know they'd call in from Park Avenue from Fifth Avenue New York oh i' love to be on the committee any committee we're going to put you in a blue ribbon committee on stopping drugs and drug abuse and stopping the Caravans from born oh that's what's a caravan they had no idea and they sit around very prestigious people and they talk for a little while and then they get onto society and social and where are you going to be tonight I'm going to be dining at lerk tonight but uh you know they go and and it's not the way you can't do it the only thing they understand is force and if you want to stop your problem and you have the single biggest problem in the country from what I see in New Hampshire I don't know why proportionately you need the death penalty if you give the death penalty to drug dealers you will have no more problem you will have no more problem you know we cut it down 21% and that was great I did that without doing this when I was in China and I told the story a couple of times maybe you've heard it but I was with President she strong man and uh I said you don't have a drug property no we don't have no drug problem we don't have drug he looked at me like what the hell of course I don't 1.4 think of it 1.4 billion people no drug problem I said what do you attribute that to he said uh quick trial I said quick trial what's quick trial we give quick trial we give very quick trial to drug dealers if somebody's selling drugs we give them a one- day it's a one- day trial they give them a trial and if they're guilty which I would say probably 120% of the time they're guilty they guilty approximately 120% of the time uh but they execute and they uh they have the death penalty for drug dealers so now if you're a drug dealer you'll say you know I think I'm going to take a pass on this particular country let's go to the United States where they don't even give you a summons right they don't even they don't do anything and uh that's why we have the problem if you want to do the real job and a lot of people I I just don't know if our country is ready for it but what could be worse than losing I think 300 350,000 you know you don't hear those numbers they always say 100 th they've been saying 100,000 people for the last what 15 years would you say it's 100 th oh yes we lose that's a lot of people that's you take your largest stadium and you fill it up twice right no good but it's 100,000 they say but even if it was a hundred but it's not it's 350,000 people you losing and you're destroying your homes you ever see what happens to a family a father a mother when they lose their son or their daughter to drugs that family is destroyed 10 years later they're destroyed it's uh it can never be the same and these people do it the average drug dealer kills 500 people a year think of it the average drug dealer over the course of his or her life will kill five and I think that's a low number but they say kills 500 people a year and uh they don't mention the families that are destroyed to go along with their children and seniors and everything else that are killed I mean a lot of people are killed but you think of it in terms of young people but the average one kills 500 so why wouldn't you do the death penalty it's actually Humane if you think about it why wouldn't you do it as Singapore does the death penalty they have no drugs whatsoever no drugs whatsoever other countries do them many countries do it but they have no drugs whatsoever and we're becoming a drug Haven you know China many years ago was being taken over by much small smaller countries because they were all drugged out on the poppy fields the poppy the drugs heroin different drugs but they were all drugged out the nation was drugged out and then Along came a very powerful leader you know who that is and he said no more and from that time pretty much until now they uh they've been strong but they were all drugged out and they were I mean our nation's becoming that way okay our nation's becoming that way way you look at our nation is uh that you almost say how does it survive when so many people are absolutely sick from drugs and drug overdose and all of the things that go with it our nation remember China was taken over by many different forces much smaller much weaker than them now they're strong but our nation's uh not so much different we have a large percentage of our people are drugged out and won't help us in terms of making America great again we have to help them and we should help them but we could stop this Gorge if we would do it properly and just out of curiosity it's interesting we're all friends the death penalty sounds harsh thank you very much but the death penalty it's you know it's funny they say oh he's conservative it's not that I'm conservative I have a I have common sense you know I want to have a border we want to have free elections we want to have low interest rates we want to have school choice we don't want to let have men play in women's sports how about that one you see a a field hockey sport the other day and they had a a man went in and he hit a shot so hard and knocked the girls the whole thing nobody's ever seen seen anything like it the B the thing was going like three times what they would expect uh and there are many many stories the weightlifting records are being beaten by hundreds of pounds the swimming they're setting records it's actually very demeaning to women and you know the amazing thing is that women and people even on the teams they don't want to talk about it because these radical left people have everybody spooked you know they indicted me because I complained about an election do you notice any difference in my tone I don't think so no I've gotten even more so because it was a crooked election and look what happened to our country look what happened to our country so I just going to ask you so death penalty sounds very bad and who wants a death penalty but you're never going to solve the problem never your Blue Ribbon committees and all of these crazy things not even if they got tough with law enforcement that's not going to solve the problem not even close so let's have a vote who would be in favor of the death penalty now wait don't don't go yet knowing that it will solve the problem it's not like OG G do you think it will no they'll head to another country they'll do something but uh that's what they do they head to from China they left for for New York City and other places okay so let's go death penalty no death penalty so who would be in favor of the death penalty to and and just out of who would not be in because it's harsh who would not be okay I could understand it look I can understand but I see one hand out of thousands of people she are you a liberal no okay I understand it it's it's a tough it's a tough thing and it and you know what happens they can get it wrong too they can get it wrong and they can abuse the system I've been abused a lot of the people in this room have been abused they can abuse they can abuse the system but I see one hand okay so let me do that again because that's right who would be opposed to bringing in the death penalty you would you it's okay seriously don't be afraid nobody's going to we're not we're not the Democrats where you they're going to put you in jail because you speak up who would be opposed I see three hands I see one hand of a person down there's she going like this meaning she doesn't know right she has she sort of likes it but it's a big step so I see three and a half okay how about back here who'd be opposed who' be opposed all right so you're probably talking 1% you know I mean if you think about it that's pretty amazing and it's a real poll now the government if they did that poll they'd charge a million dollars for it it wouldn't be as accurate you know that right we did it in about 2 minutes uh but uh if you want to solve the drug problem in the United States really solve it you have to bring back the death penalty for drug dealers that's what you have to do and you'll solve it so whether you're a Democrat a Republican or independent if you don't want your sons and daughters drafted to fight and die in distant foreign lands that many of you have never even heard of if you don't want your nation wrecked if you don't want your economy destroyed if you don't want American blood and American treasure squandered in a needless global war you see it they never end they go for years 21 22 years in Afghanistan think of it 21 years 21 years too bad it carried out that long we were going to get out of Afghan we were coming out of Afghanistan you know I'm the one that got it down to 2,500 troops but I was going to keep bogram you know bogram is one of the biggest air bases in the world cost us billions of dollars years ago billions and billions of dollars has the biggest most power powerful runways meaning the thickest concrete of any place I think it's 8 ft you know I used to go when I was building I'd like to go 4 in and I'd negotiate maybe we can do it for three and a half these things are many feet thick most powerful most powerful runways and everything else and uh they gave it back they gave it all back but you have to really you have to put people that know what to do and if you want to get back to where we have to go you have to vote for a gentleman named Donald J Trump that's all I can say that's all I can say We'll turn it around fast you know somebody said oh but he'll be there for 4 years he'll be there for four years and somebody else could be there for eight years let me tell you eight years if it takes eight years you don't want that person okay I said that as soon as I said that they never Ed that line of crap anymore they said I can be there for eight years and I'll solve and then they realized that I said how about 6 months because most of this will be solved in 6 months some of it sooner we'll be drilling a lot sooner than that for four straight years under the Trump Administration I kept America safe I kept Israel safe I kept Ukraine safe he would have never got in I mean I did it through osmosis it was safe he was never going to go in and I kept the whole world safe it's like Victor Orban said great great smart tough man but a real leader he said he kept the whole world the whole world was if we didn't have any of these problems think of it go back three years we didn't have any of these problems and we had the greatest economy in our history I completely obliterated the Isis territorial caliphate completely wiped out Isis and it was supposed to take you know to wipe out Isis you know that it was supposed to take years I was told years and we uh I went to Iraq I met with the generals I found a couple of generals I thought were fantastic I was told it would take four years that we maybe couldn't do it and uh I said how long general you know who the general is Right raisen Kane General raisin Kane I said I love you if your name is raisin Kane that the that's what I'm looking for I want General raisin Kane working for me I love raisin cane but I said to him what's your name General he said my name is Caine sir Caine I said what's your first name raisin I said raisin that's what they call me sir raisin cane I said is that because you rais Kane I guess that's what they mean sir I said General I think I'm going to like you and I said to him uh how long will it take you to knock out Isis I went there I actually flew there uh extreme bravery when I did that because I had to fly in air force one we had it darken our Windows they said sir we're going to have to we're flying over enemy territory think of it we're there for 21 years with the best equipment in the world that we still have to darken our Windows to fly in but I figured uh let's do it and they turned off all the lights inside and outside of the plane I went up to the C to the cockpit and I saw people that were better looking than Tom Chris okay cuz you know when you fly the president they have the best they take that best of the Air Force the best of the they take only the best and these guys are like Central Casting they could be movie stars in fact if I was ever an agent I'd just hire these people I'd make a fortune boom crew cut and I see the captain I say uh how you doing Captain I'm doing fine sir we'll be there Sirah in about 20 minutes I said Captain I don't see any lights outside I don't see any lights in your cockpit I don't see anything sir we're just fine sir and he's surrounded by people that looked as good as him I said am I in a movie no we don't have people like they they don't look like that in Hollywood I say he's Tom Cruz I'm not insulting short people I said this guy's Tom Cruz but much taller okay then he goes he goes uh sir we'll be there in 15 minutes I say captain that sounds great to me and I'm going because I haven't seen there's nothing and there are a lot of people back there you know they have operators they have this they have Engineers I never saw so many people on a plane before operating a plane but it's Air Force One so you know you say that's okay that's not our big problem we have other problems but they're all really fantastic and they're really the top of the line top in the world so we're coming in we're 15 minutes away and uh he didn't says so we'll be 10 minutes and we'll be landing I say I still don't see any lights at all and I do that I I like to sit with pilots and land ples you know I have a nice clean and I sit sometimes with the p is beautiful to watch and uh so now we're 5 minutes away and you have a machine that has a voice of a machine but it's actually sounds like a human but the most beautiful voice you've ever heard and it talks you as you're Landing it tells you what's going on very standard it's you know the highest grade equipment then I hear 1,000 that means 1,000 feet 1,000 ft is very a big plane like that that's very low that's like a 10-story building that's not very high right and we're flying over like desert I hear 1,000 900 800 you know as it's going down it's going down like this and everything's fine it's going down but I don't see any lights you know usually you see lights you see LaGuardia you see Kennedy airport and you see lights in the distance and you think isn't that a beautiful sight well we're going down and I didn't see a damn light they have all the lights turn and they said uh 600 500 it's an incredible voice a computer voice but it's so perfect 400 I say captain are we okay I'm sort of taking my I'm trying to pretend I'm I'm fine but I don't see a light and I got these guys and they're up there and dead confident as a sir we're just fine sir so we'll be landing in a about a minute sir a minute goes 300 200 are still there's not a light it's dark and I think there wasn't even a moon out that night 200 100 I'm 100 fet above the ground I see nothing and then you hear p p p you know we land I say it's a miracle and you know what I said I said to my staff right after I landed am I allowed because I showed great bravery I thought am I allowed to give myself the Congressional Medal of Honor I want to give myself cuz I showed great bravery he said give me a towel give me a towel no I showed great bravery no they said that wouldn't be a good idea I'm only k you know what happens now the Press will take that and they'll say he decided I had that actually I told the story once I said the Press said he wanted to give himself the Congressional ble of Honor so you can't be too sarcastic with these people because they know it's we're having a little fun and uh if you can have fun nowadays it's not a lot of fun but the Press actually reported me for saying I wanted the Congressional Medal of Honor can you believe it for myself because they're fake news oh yeah I got a couple of beauties up there that story that story will be told tomorrow and the the highlight of the story is that I demanded the Congressional Medal of Honor I guarantee it so when you read it just go fake news anyway but I came out and and the doors open and I'm greeted by it's goodlooking group of people a staff sergeant a drill sergeant looked like a piece of granite a general another General a colonel group of people on the bottom I go down and that's when I met uh General raisen Kan and he was the boss and they all said uh great toet you shook their hands sir would you like to rest you know it's a long trip like 20 hours I said no I don't have to arrest now if Biden were president at that time I'd say you know what he'd do he'd rest for about 4 days then they turn around did you meet the president no he was sleeping the whole time he he spent 3 days sleeping and then he turned around and went back and went immediately into the beautiful bedroom of Air Force One went to sleep this is not what we're supposed to have for a president so I went down he said sir would you like to rest I said I don't need to rest let's go so we start a meeting and I said uh how do we defeat Isis we've been fighting him for 21 years we have the best equipment in the world they hardly have equipment they are great Fighters by the way great Fighters they're natural Fighters that's what they do for 2,000 years they fight they come down from the M they can live in a crevice in the mountain don't forget you know you look at what they won it's amazing but they these are great Fighters how do we defeat these guys and uh we said we can do it he said how long would it take you now I was told four years by a couple of our television Generals in Washington A Millie is Millie a beauty but I was told it would take four years sir it will take four years very big effort so I asked uh I asked General raisin can and said General how long would it take to do it sir we can do it in four weeks and I think we'll have time left over I said wait a minute for years not me everybody you were hearing four five six years and very hard to do and now I have a guy sitting there that that truly is Central Casting and I'm sitting here and he's saying I can do it in 4 weeks and he'll have time left over so I say how do you do that he says well sir when they came in from Washington you know Mattis General mtis General Millie real Beauties General Millie is the one that decided to take the soldiers out first okay General Millie is the one that said let's leave $85 billion worth of equipment behind because it's cheaper than taking it out it's cheaper than putting a a tank of nice clean fuel in the airplane and flying it to Pakistan or flying it all the way home it's cheaper to leave it there we left them brand new planes brand new helicopters thousands of night goggles better than the ones we have these are brand new never used in boxes 700,000 rifles 700,000 rifles 70,000 vehicles trucks cars many of them armor plated many of them costing over a million dollars a piece armor plated and this is what we left so I said to him said General so how can you do it so quickly I've been told it would take years to he said well sir when they came in from Washington we have to obey there are superiors so we're not allowed to give our ideas I said that doesn't sound like a good system he says but that's the military system they would come in and they would tell us what to do even though we're here and and when you think about it it's incredible because the people we're talking about are incompetent and the people I'm talking about are unbelievable soldiers and the reason if you'd like me to finish the story The reason I tell you this is that we have an unbelievable military okay we just have some really bad leaders so so I think it's an important story but but I said so General how are you going to do it in four weeks and they can't do it in four years he says well sir when they came in they would only use the base and this base is very far away it's big base it's a main base we gave it to China by the way you know who has that base right now China because when they left China has the base and the reason we should have kept it not for Afghanistan we should have kept it because it's one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons right so we give it up how stupid are these people so anyway so General raisin cane goes no sir uh we can do it in four weeks we can do it very quickly I said so what was the problem well sir they came in I disagreed but it's not for me to say they came in sir and they they said very strongly we can only use the one base now the one base is very far away by the time we got there to the site we had to turn around to refuel come back so they were going here they about two two seconds and now head back let's head back and that's what we had but we have portable what we call portable bases sir we have a lot of portable bases we have nine of them at least already up and if we use our portable bases I said why didn't they said well they're located in some countries and they would consider it not politically correct but sir nobody would know where the hell these planes are coming from I said that's probably right she said they're politically correct they want to be politically correct so they didn't do it so they had seven to nine bases so he said so what I'd do is very simple I'd leave from here but this is the least important I'd Supply from here here but I'd go out to all of these auxiliary or portable bases and I'd hit them from the left and Sir I'd hit him from the right and I'd hit him from up above and I'd hit him from right under their rest sir and I'd hit him from so many directions they wouldn't know what the hell is happening and Sir it'll be over very quickly I said I have to think about this because nobody's ever told me this nobody's ever told me this I said I'll speak to you I went back to Washington and I spoke to him on Monday or Tuesday and I said you still feel you can do that General absolutely sir I said go ahead and do it and he knocked the hell out of him and he knocked him out knock them out less than four wordss and then I had to give an order because there were a lot of them that were cornered he said sir we got cornered rats I said what do you mean rats they're human beings and they're not human beings sir these people are these are bad people sir these are really bad people I said uh so what are you suggesting he said well you let me know when the job will be completely finished I said well that's a lot of people you're asking me about you know that's never been my thing I build beautiful buildings I do other things right they said that's never really been it's a lot of people he said they're not people sir so here here's what you do take those gorgeous F-16 and fly over them for a while keep flying over them get those F 24s f-22s you fly over them and maybe you'll scare the hell out of them and they'll surrender they won't surrender sir they don't know what the surrender is they don't know what a white flag is Sir they don't surrender whether you like them or not those son of a they will never ever surrender and I say so what do you think I said here's what you do spend a little time flying back and forth let's see he said 'yes sir I'll do that sir and he did he calls me up uh sir what do you want me to do well did it have any impact absolutely none sir they don't care they're prepared to die I said all right you have to finish it off he finished it off and you know what we got rid of Isis 100% of Isis and then and then I took out Al baghdaddy the leader of Isis so I knocked out Al B Daddy and then I also ended the life of the world's top terrorist cam solaman the father of the roadside bomb every one of you and respectfully I love you but you you too uh he made he was a father of the roadside bomb the bomb and uh he made him bigger bigger bigger they kept getting bigger bigger and more sophisticated 94% of the people that died or had legs or arms or faces obliterated removed from their body 94% was because of salaman and I took him out too bigger than any terrorist in the world I went to Walter Reed on numerous occasions because to see the soldiers and I've never been uh I would always say I could have never been a doctor cuz I can't handle that stuff right you know I'm not if I see somebody with a little finger little blood I said and yet I was able to handle it so incredibly well because when I looked I don't know it was a different feeling of Love or something but I would go a lot and I'd see these soldiers come back so badly wounded so badly the by the way the doctors at that hospital are unbelievable they what they can do but you know some of these lives the lives are so bad one young man he went to Princeton University Princeton he was a great student he was actually you know family's well to do I understand he wanted to spend some time as a life experience and he went to Princeton and he got blown to pieces in his last day he got lost both legs both arms and most of his face and I walked into the room and his parents were there grieving I've never seen anything like it they couldn't believe it you know this kid was like this perfect handsome they have a picture of him by the bed you know you see him and he's so badly horribly hurt and they have a picture of him by the bed beautiful handsome guy I'd love to look like that I said I'd love to look like that I told his parents I said boy this is tough huh he said we never thought this was possible he wanted this before going to work on Wall Street he was going to do this as a life experience you know he thought life experience another one was a great young man he was unbelievable with the roadside bombs he was the best guy at finding them and he had you know we had great equipment for it we had the long I don't know if you've ever seen him with the long rods and they have on the end they have tremendous uh equipment computerized in every way but the most incredible equipment and he had a half a day to go and he said hey I'll go with you guys into the field and he went into the field he said I'll go with you he's got a half a day he's coming home got a half a day but he's friends with all these great soldiers great people and uh so that he spent his laugh last half day there they're going out and they're looking for roadside bomb bombs and he got that hell blown out of him and like like you would like you wouldn't even believe honestly uh a few years before that you could never save these soldiers what they do the you know the way the way they can what they can do to keep people alive today is so different than it was just a few years ago it's incredible in some cases maybe maybe it's not even that good a thing because the lives are so horribly destroyed but he went in and he was searching and what happened is salaman was all of his bombs were being detected by brilliant young guys and brave guys like this and he came up with a new bomb even bigger but more importantly every single ounce of that bomb was made out of plastic so the metal detector only detects metal every ounce of that thing big was made out of what's called hardened plastic and doesn't have to be that strong even the screws are PL they show the screws are made out of plastic everything's plastic so he's looking for metal first day they put them in and he got blown up most of his friends died and think of it he could have left he didn't have to go out with him that day he went out and he lost his life and that was Soloman that did that the king the father of the road side bomb the biggest terrorist in the world nobody close I mean uh Osama Bin Laden wasn't even in that league and he killed so many people not only soldiers a lot of our soldiers a lot of soldiers but it destroyed the lives of so many people and so many people are walking around now without legs or without arms because of him we took him out we got him we got him the prime minister of Pakistan told me when I heard and he was a friend of my very handsome guy was a great athlete and uh Khan prime minister and I was with him he said I've won many awards you know he was the number one Cricket player in the world or just about number one he was like uh take your best athlete take a Tom Brady he was like the Tom Brady of cricket which which over there which over there is the biggest they don't know about football they know Cricket everything's Cricket they have stadiums they build a stadium in India that holds 100 38,000 people it's big and he was just about the best player celebrated all over the world but he retired he ran for office he won as a great celebrity and athlete he said when I heard that Soloman was killed he said I believe it was the biggest day of my life and he didn't say happiness or sadness he said I've never had an event so big as that and when I heard that he was killed he was feared all over the Middle East feared he was as you know from Iran and it really set them back a long time I believe that the mullers I believe that uh the leaders of Iran actually were happy about it because they were afraid of him very afraid of him I believe I may be wrong about that but the Prime Minister told me that when I heard that Soloman was killed I walked to my house from my office and I stayed at my house and contemplated for one week I couldn't believe this happened this was the biggest event in my lifetime he said you have no idea and I was told that by one or two other leaders to something very similar and uh and we took them out and I think that's one of the reasons that I had no problem with Iran Iran was broke when I was there not when I started but when I finished I told China if you give Iran $1 for oil they have a lot of oil if you purchase any oil you're not doing business with the United States and and any business that gets through we're going to tariff or tax you at 100% so China didn't buy I mean you can look at this you got to look at the numbers they went down I had them down to almost nothing and by the time I left and then we had the election and if had that election not been rigged and stolen and which it was had that election not been rigged and stolen had the election been fair you would have never had a problem for two reasons number one they didn't have the money but you would have had a deal they wanted to make a deal they were going to make a deal they were broke they said uh the other day one of the commentators who's not a trump guy at all very liberal guy but he said whether you like him or not Iran was he broke he he broke them but he said they were broke they didn't have any money and you remember reading about they couldn't give Hamas any money they couldn't give Hezbollah any money because they didn't have any money now they've got a hundred billion dollar plus six billion for a wonderful deal we made on think of the deal that we made five hostages five hostages I said no but then they say well that's not all it's five and five but they get $6 billion dollar think of it just think how how stupid but the six billion is peanuts compared to the oil you know the 6 billion it plays well it reads well and it's simple to understand although nobody would do the deal how stupid by the way when they made that deal I said you're going to have now hostages captured all over the world because once you agreed you know I did 58 hostages I got 58 people back four of them from North Korea that's tough I got 58 hostages back for no money we never paid money because once you pay money you set a precedent where they're going to do it again and again and again so it was uh it was a big thing and uh when I tell you the story about the Prime Minister I don't think I've told that story to a large group but I tell you about the Prime Minister he thought it was the biggest event of his life he never thought this could happen I fully rebuilt the US military created space force and I was the first president in decades who didn't start a war instead I got us out of those endless Wars and brought our troops back home and with the historic Abraham Accords I even made peace in the Middle East we had peace we got the Abraham cords we would have had just about every country signed up within months after the election and they you know how many countries they've added to the Abraham Accords none not a country because they're incompetent look look Biden is the most corrupt and most incompetent president in the the history of our country and and you know until I got indicted because once you get I get indicted for for this nonsense even every legal scholar says these indictments and they're not indictments they're political opponent indictments political opponent people forget that they say oh Donald Trump is going to court no and even the ones at a state level or a city level he put his people meaning they put their people Garland and the young woman that works right under him who's a big friend of Weissman you know Weissman they've been after me for years and that's fine so far they haven't done too well I became president and they said man they couldn't believe it you know they said we can never let this happen again and that's what they did that's how they cheated we can never let this happen again but we're going to have it happen this time it's going to be the biggest election in history but we got to be careful we got be careful 2024 will be the biggest election in history will be the biggest before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after we win the president because it's we are going to win it I'll have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled we should have never started but I'll get it settled I know them both very well good relationship with very very good relationship with both it's got to get settled the human lives the the number of lives being lost is far greater than what you're hearing where do you see when you see buildings like that coming down uh the number of lives being lost is far greater than anybody knows we'll get that settled before I even get into the Oval Office we will get it settled to protect our citizens from foreign threats I will build a state-of-the-art missile defense Shield you know we have a lot of crazy people out there and they're willing to do and we actually have that technology now it's our technology by the way but you see how it works in Israel where they shoot down like 98% of the missiles they're like shooting needles in the sky it's incredible the talent and to today really to be a great shot you're better if you went to MIT than if you lift weights all day long you know but it's it's incredible when you see these guys in action they're shooting down these these little missiles in this guy and they shoot him down they didn't have that you know Ronald Reagan wanted to do that but we really didn't have the technology even close then but now we have the most incredible technology much of it is in New Hampshire by the way you know you have a lot of that technology right here but we're going to we're going to build a great remember when uh Russia was going crazy over it they hated the fact that we were doing it because it meant they had to build Much More Much More and the put a lot of pressure on Reagan Reagan was a really good president except in trade I did I disagreed with him on trade but he was a very good president and had a great way about him right he was like it was like your father in the White House and it was good but he was excellent and he wanted to do that years ago but we really didn't have the technology today we do and you know it's okay to spend a lot of money to defend if somebody goes crazy from some country if we can shoot that missile down that's not a bad thing that's a good thing and we're creating jobs in our own country and it's jobs for things that are very important I will end Joe Biden's disastrous war on American Energy and unleash the most powerful economic weapon it's called drilling for oil or as I call it liquid gold or as I say sometimes drill baby drill right drill Baby K we have more Liquid Gold than anybody it's no wonder crooked Joe Biden and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary you got to watch you know we're going to have a lot of votes we're going to have plenty of votes the big thing that we all fear everybody in this room fears is the way they cheat on elections uh it's the second most question I think the first question I get from people people come up and talk and they say Sir could I ask you a question yes how do you take it that's my first question because this isn't supposed to happen to a former president who is very popular I got 75 million votes I got and that's their count okay which is a phony count but I got votes more votes in any sitting president in history and I went from 63 to 75 that's the biggest increase there's never been a pres most presidents like Obama got less the second time by millions others [Applause] get who said that who said [Applause] that and by the way that somebody else said something they said this man said something he shouldn't say I will defend he said Chris chrisy is a fat pig you you cannot say that sir you can please please take that back please take that back no no no no he said Chris Chris is a fat pig you cannot do [Applause] that this is a tough group this is a tough group anyway they're weaponizing you know the beauty of that is you know he said that and I'm correcting him but the beauty of that is the fake news you know you're not allowed to use the fat word and you're probably not used allowed to use the pig word right the beauty of that is that the Press can't really do anything because I'm defending him I'm defend they they can't do anything so you know so it's sort of interesting the way that works out they can't really write the story because I'm defending the fact that you can't use the word fat pig when you describe Chris Cen he's not a fat pig for purposes of he is not a fat pig they're weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference because we're beating them so badly in the polls you know I don't know if you've been seeing the polls the polls are going through the roof and I think you like me the way you've liked me we've had a great love affair had a great loveair but what you're seeing now what you're seeing now is something that you've never seen before now you're seeing the most incompetent people in the history of our country running this uh this country country with open borders and all of the things they're doing you know your taxes are going to go up four times your energy prices have gone through the roof all of the inflation that would have never happened it was caused by energy with me you were going to have low energy so it would have you would have never had any inl we had no inflation we had the best economy in history but you know uh it's going up so when you see it's no longer just you like me and you like my policies you like see that what's happened to this country the St idity of the fact that maybe in a way one of the most important things we're not respected anymore in the world they laugh at us they think this guy and again I would have never talked about him with this disrespect until they indicted me once they indicted me I said I mean it can't happen and they indicted me for nothing they indicted me they indicted me for criticizing the election they indicted me for things and virtually every legal scholar you read says how can it happen they got me in New York where my company turned out to be a great company instead of a bad company they indicted me because they said I inflated numbers and my numbers it turned out were extremely conservative just the opposite of what and now they don't know what to do and the judge is being made to look look he's a radical left person and he he actually accused me of something before he ever before the trial started and now it's sort of coming home to play we'll see what happens but it's a it's a disgrace so when they did that and you know they're using State people like this AG Leticia James she's she's a disaster no she's a disaster she's grossly incompetent what she does is and she she campaigned for a year I will get Trump I will get him I will get knowing nothing about me her whole campaign many candidates she got a little a few votes said it was more than anybody else she becomes the Attorney General of New York right and she campaigned on this didn't know a thing about me and then gets witnesses that have now been all they lied the one witness their star witness he lied so badly they don't even know what's going to happen he totally made up the and he admitted it it was a Perry Mason moment at the end where Perry Mason do you mean and then some guy walks into the courthouse he looks he goes oh I did it I killed him I killed and that's the end of the show I had that live in New York last week the star witness against me lied and then said all the things that he said about me are false can you believe it so we say we want to directed verdict I won't give that to you the whole thing is crazy but you know what the people get it and that's why our poll numbers are high I'm the only person in history that got indicted that saw about a 30% rise in my PO numbers usually you know we were doing fine before usually you get indicted you're a politician you get indicted and about within five minutes you're at a microphone uh I've de started I will go home to my family and I will be with my family and I will fight for my name and my reputation okay you know all that and that's the end that's the last time you ever hear from the poor person with me it's like I said how are we doing sure your poll numbers up 14 points today you know why because I explain it to people and they get it this is a political opponent hitting his political opponent and it's never happened in this country before it has happened in many other countries third world Nations banana republics but the people get it I mean I have a judge in Washington DC who put a gag order on me I cannot speak so if the fake news asked me a question about like something I cannot speak I'm sorry how do you think that would be in a campaign you watching what do you think about the campaign I'm sorry I can't comment she put a gag on her then it's been taken off by the appell division but you got to count but but think of it they do things like this but she sets a trial date this could not be one day before super Tuesday now you know super Tuesday is a big day now to me the big day is Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina Nevada because I think this whole thing might be you know we're up about 42 points here we're up 44 points in uh Iowa I think 44 point something how can the farmers vote against me I got them $28 billion from China nobody else would have done that nobody's I got the farmers of Iowa Nebraska Wisconsin all these said $28 billion because they were abused by China for so many years I said what was the number to Sunny Purdue Commissioner of Agriculture in the United States under me good guy he said about 28 billion I got the money from China out of the tariffs that I got which was many times that number I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China I gave our Farmers 28 billion nobody can believe it then my people say please don't be so arrogant about it I see say what's arrogant I got them 28 they're not going to vote against me and that's exactly what's turning out I told that to uh Iowa the other day and they were all laughing but it's true I got them $28 billion dollar that they got screwed out of by China with really bad things they did to our farmers and what farmer is going to vote against me for some stiff that was never for them like tens of millions of and I'm not wearing lifts either by the way I don't have six C Hills actually the greatest moment of the debate when Ron was walking arounda sanon is was walking off the stage and his feet it's weird cuz his cowboy boots so they have a high heel outside but inside you got a big deal going on and he's walking like no he's walking off the stage like he's trying to balance himself I thought he was wearing ice skates no what difference does it make right what difference when you think about it what difference does it make like tens of millions of people within our nation I'm proud and strong election I'm a very proud election denier Because unless the truth is found we will never have Fair free and honest elections and we have to have them and again for the first time in American history a sitting Administration is charge its only opponent I think I guess you could say leading but I think it's only I hope that's correct but it's its opponent with criminal offenses think of it now that means that I could do that too I'll be in the white house I don't want to do that I wouldn't do that but you know what I'll be sitting there and they'll say Sir there's a Democrat who surging I say uh really well you know they did it to me now I can do it to them indict him for walking across the street in an improper Manner and when he gets indicted he'll go right down the tubes CU they don't have much of a platform now it's a very bad precedent that they're starting it's sort of like we talked about with with the uh hostage stuff where they get paid $6 billion doar you know you set a precedent well this is a president that maybe in a certain way is much worse than that I did a great job and I got indicted I got indicted so when I say I never used to say he's a stone cold crook he's the most grossly incompetent president in now I say it and I'm saying the truth because I had too much I had too much respect for the office of President aware that its uh charges are bogus think of it this was all bogus stuff the prosecution sought to proceed in secret forcing the nation in the world to rely on biased secondhand accounts coming from the corrupt Biden Administration and its media allies people like that you know the funny thing their numbers are way down and they said they had the greatest numbers they've ever had during the Trump Administration if I were the media now they're all going bankrupt if I were the media you know what I do i' I hope that Trump wins because during the Trump Administration that was the golden the Golden four years now they're I just saw where the New York Times is way down they were all way down Washington Post is way down I don't even know you you know at what point do you say you could be rich but at what point if you're going to lose $100 million a year for the privilege of having a newspaper that's losing that kind of money you know at what point you say I'm not going to do this anymore but the Washington Post is way down they're all down and they were all up dur during my four years now they were up with fake stories like Russia Russia Russia you know the Muer meller meller all the different hoaxes and we had plenty of them but they were doing great now they're way down and you know because they not believed anymore you know that's the problem when I started running they had a very high approval rating and I think it's one of the greatest things I've done I've told people that they're corrupt and they're dishonest and they have to straighten out their act because people are not believing them and when you don't have a free press and when you don't believe your press you've got yourself a very big problem in the country but as a result the citizens of our great country are unable to review for themselves the facts of this case and show so it's so unfair and uh I look at it and when you think about you got treated this way by your political opponent so when you hear Trump is facing a lawsuit remember this isn't this is a Biden lawsuit this was Biden he took his top person from the Department of Justice and put him into the local New York Manhattan DA's office running it you're not even allowed to do that but they took the top person as you know I believe the name is coangelo they took the top person they put him into the Manhattan DA's office Colangelo and this guy was in Washington DC working for Garland and now he's in this office and even signing checks and the papers this is a terrible thing that's happened and I don't even know I mean to be honest I don't even know if Biden knows but the people in his office knows like Lisa Monaco and other people they they know they know what's going on you know they're friends with some very bad people but it's a very bad precedent it's very dangerous and again such a thing has never happened in our country I've made clear from the outset the prosecution has repeatedly denied me my fundamental constitutional rights including my right to have a trial I want the trial I announced last night you probably saw it they said sir do you want a trial with or without cameras now most people would say without I say the opposite I want this trial to be seen by everybody in the world the prosecution wishes to continue this travesty in darkness and I want sunlight that's a nice way of saying it isn't that pretty I want sight I want everything exposed to the public including the election fraud because this is all about election FR which took place in 2020 and the 2020 presidential election so that such a thing can never happen again to our country you know look we want paper ballots we want same day voting that's what we want and we want we don't want mailin voting and we want one day voting you know these things that last for 48 days and you see him Wheeling things with wheelbarrows dumping them ballots now what we want is we want one day voting we want paper ballots so we want voter ID you know they just did it in France France had mailin ballots look mailin ballots you know are going to be corrupt even Jimmy Carter had a commission he said if you have mail in ballots you're going to have massive corruption and we don't want that but every person in America is beyond and should have the opportunity to study this case firsthand it to be oh this was would be very good for the networks they should want it but I can tell you the prosecutors don't want it and the judge doesn't want it if you can believe it and they watch and if there's a trial because I should not even have a trial this should be thrown out long before but if there's a trial I want everybody to see all of the horrible things that took place all of the horrible charges and all of the things that were done with respect to a very corrupt election and let's let the public decide because I want cameras in every inch of that Courthouse we've asked the judge in Washington DC we've asked her to be recused because she hates me you know is that a good reason I think so right no the judge truly truly hates me she is a trump hater at the highest level so we've asked for her accusal she's denied it and we'll we're appealing that and we'll definitely be asking for a venue change DC especially in light of the fact that I want a federal government takeover of our Capital so that we can uh fix our Capital it's dirty it's filthy it's crimer ridden people are being murdered every day it's incompetently run and I want uh to do that and certainly that would not be very popular with the jury of residents they're not going to be thrilled we have deranged Jack Smith have you ever heard of him he's a lovely he's a lovely man do you ever see him with the purple little thing he's a lovely man the trumpeting prosecutor in the case he's uh his wife and family despised me much more than he does and he desdes I think he's about a 10 they're about a 15 on a scale of 10 and he was involved you know Jack Smith the deranged one I call him he was involved crooked guy he was involved with the failed and very messy lowest learner IRS scale did you know that and the prosecution of governor of Virginia Bob McDonald which was overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court as well as the failed prosecution of presidential candidate John Edwards and he's charged uh what he did is horrible but they got him and they brought him back from the heg and uh they said go get Trump it's a terrible thing that's happening in America but uh and he's a disgrace to America they want to silence me because I know the truth and I'm not afraid to say it they're goal is intimidation of everybody at the highest level but I really don't care I don't care I just want to do what's right for the country I didn't need this you know when I did this when I did this somebody said the other day are you glad you did it because I had a hell of a life I had the most beautiful life I don't think I could do whatever I want the best properties the best resorts I could have had the greatest time instead I'm here on a Saturday afternoon with you working my ass off working my ass off up here no I had a good life but I I was asked the question thank you that's very nice thank you but I was asked the question very a lot actually but I was asked this question if you had it to do again with all I've been through I mean I got indicted more than Al Capone did you ever hear of Al scarest he was the meanest of all gangsters if he had dinner with you and you looked at him in the wrong way you looked at him like you smiled and you were mocking him you were a dead person alons Capone Scarface he got indicted one time I got indicted four times and uh and I have other trials too you know I have other civil trials I have to go through this is a terrible thing nobody's ever done it before but they asked me if you had it to you had such a great life if you had it to do again would you do it I didn't even hesitate I said absolutely because we made America great again and we're going to make it even greater you know there are a lot of Rich guys around that didn't do much and they whatever but no I would do it again in a heartbeat people find that hard to believe and uh one thing I think I've kept a lot of rich people out of politics you know I used to have guys say smart guys I used to uh one guy said oh I want to do it so much I want to do it so much I'm going to do a very successful guy Killer really successful he said but I have one problem I said what's your problem he said I have stage fright I said if you have stage fight don't become a politician don't I think I saved him a lot of uh a lot of Anguish but they asked me would you do it again I said absolutely I said it without even thinking absolutely I would do it again because what we did is Miracles don't forget this is the greatest movement of all time there's never been anything like [Music] this never been anything like this there's never been a movement in probably anywhere but in this country certainly but probably anywhere because of the importance of this country but uh you remember Pat Buchanan how well he did 50 years ago in New Hampshire right and because he almost won right he came in second I think right but he did very well against an incumbent and uh I think did he come in second does anybody remember it a long time ago but anyway I think he came in second and he became legendary for the rest of his life and very successful and you know one of the greatest political pundits good man but we won every state think of it every single state we came out in 2016 and just state after state after State we won you we won South Carolina remember I was going to go down to South Carolina they said oh he'll never win South Carolina because bush is very close to the military Bush did nothing for the military and then I won by like 70% 70% and then we went up to Nevada and then we went to Florida and I had two people I had two people I had a senator right and I had a governor and I had both of them and I said this is not good because and they had a thing that if you win win or take all so I said I don't want winner take all because we had Bush was the governor we had Marco is the senator sitting Senator I said that's a lot to compete with I don't want to do that because you know give us our proportion if I'm a 10% or 5% at least let me have that so I was all set to Sue and a poll came out and it said uh Trump would win Florida by 70% Marco would get 11 and Bush would get nine I said stop the lawsuit immediately stop that lawsuit but every time the radical left Democrats marxists Communists and fascists indict me I consider it truly a great bad of Honor because I'm being indicted for you I am being indicted for you thank you very much I appreciate it thanks thanks a lot thanks a lot ladies never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom and in the end they're not after me they're after you I'm just standing in their way I'm standing in their way this is far more than a campaign this is far more than a campaign we were all involved in a great political movement the greatest such movement ever in the history of our country I mean there's never been a movement like this not even not even close and now it looks I mean if you look at the polls we're winning we're winning every swing state we're winning states that nobody's even thought about after years of betrayals of New Hampshire workers together we ended the NAFTA disaster the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with the brand new usmca that's Mexico and Canada the best trade deal ever made I appointed nearly 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court Justices we achieved the most secure Border in US history we built over 500 miles of border wall they like to say oh it was less it's not it's much more than that and we got Mexico to give us 28,000 soldiers free of charge so when they say about Mexico I saw some guy in the debate say oh Mex Mexico gave us 28,000 soldiers they said they're going to pay for the world but there was no mechanism for that you know sometimes you don't have I said you got to give us soldiers you got to give us right now we have the biggest Caravans in history coming up right now they're coming up I got them to give us free of charge 28,000 soldiers now I didn't tell you I said to them if you don't do that we're going to tariff every product that you sell into the United States at approximately 25% and they said we would love to give you those soldiers on my first day back in the Oval Office I will terminate every open borders policy of the Biden Administration Stop The Invasion we are this is an invasion this is like a military Invasion we'll stop The Invasion on our Southern border and begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history I will immediately restore and expand the Trump travel ban on entry from Terror PL countries which was a big thing you know we had no Terror during my Administration the only Terror we had was Nancy Pelosi who's a crazed lunatic she's a lunatic she is a crazed lunatic what the hell was going on with her husband let's not ask let's not ask I'll withdraw that statement by the way she's got a wall around her house obviously in that case it didn't work very well did it it didn't work and I'll implement strong and ideological screenings for all immigrants and if you hate America if you want to abolish Israel if you sympathize with jihadists and people that hate our country because they're not getting in then we will stop because then you have to just go for the other side if you hate America you have to go for the other side we will stop Joe Biden's inflation disaster immediately and rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world we had that and unlike Ronda San demonius who wants a 23% national sales tax on everybody in this room which would devastate New Hampshire would devastate your economy would go to hell I'll give you tax cuts regulation Cuts interest rate Cuts like you've never seen before you know I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country larger than the Reagan tax cuts and I gave you the largest regulation Cuts that's why we had the best job numbers ever I will approve pipelines and infrastructure to cut through the cost of energy and you know if you had a pipeline going through New York State your energy cost will be less than half do you know that and they couldn't do you know that you have the highest energy costs in the nation your Governor ought to work on that one too you pay more than any other state in the nation and with a simple pipeline going through New York State your energy cost would be cut in less than half you would get all the energy you need but but they can't get it done and I had it just about done until coid came in I had it done but I had to get Democrat approval and you would have had it but we'll get it done very quickly very very quickly unlike Ronda santis the other day on NBC they said ladies and gentlemen we're pleased to have as our guest Governor Ronda sanctis that's called great branding when you brand a guy so strong that they don't even know what his name is anymore unlike the sanctis I will protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors he was not good on Social Security and Medicare on day one I'll sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding of any school pushing critical race Theory Tren no but can you believe you even have to say it pushing critical race Theory transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content on our children how about we will stop the sexual mutilation of your children can you believe no can you believe you have to say that can you imagine if somebody got up here 15 years ago and made this St we will stop the sexual mutilation of your children they'll say is this guy no we will stop it can you believe this that you have to say it I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate and the other thing and I said it I alluded to it before but who would ever think that this is even a possibility I will keep men immediately out of women's sports can you believe it that that that you have to say that it's embarrassing to say it because people you know people from 20 years ago if they came back 30 years ago probably 10 years ago if they came came back and heard some of the things that I'm saying we're going to do they're going to say that place has really gone bad I will fully uphold the Second Amendment as I did not a change was made and I will continue to protect innocent life we will restore free speech and I will secure our elections once and for all and we will do it we will do it properly and in conclusion this this is what we must do to restore our country to Greatness the USA is a mess Israel is under attack our economy is cratering inflation is totally out of control China Russia Iran North Korea formed together as a menacing and destructive Coalition like probably we've never seen before our currency is crashing I will and I will soon no longer think of it it's soon going to not be the world standard based on what's happening right now which will be the greatest defeat once our currency is no longer the world standard that will be the greatest defeat that we've had as a country in 200 years then we will revert to Third World status it won't happen with me not even a little chance just like Russia would never have invaded Ukraine China would not even have thought about raiding Taiwan and the attack on Israel would never have happened would never have happened again Iran had no money they were broke we would have left Afghanistan with dignity and strength instead of our greatest embarrassment in history with the loss and I'm so sorry but the loss of your children and your family if you took the 10 worst Presidents in the history of the United States and added them up they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden Administration have done we are a failing Nation we are a nation in serious Decline and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement it's totally corrupt and we will not let it happen if you want to save America from crooked Joe and then get every you have to go out you have to really do it we have to do it you know the one way we win uh like you've never seen before we we have to slam it on Election Day we have to come up with votes because there's a point at which they're cheating can't get it done we is a point at which the cheating can't get it done so get every Patriot you know and get them out to deliver a massive victory in the primary but honestly more importantly in the election the primary let's get the primary done first we'll be back here many times but we got to get the primary done first so join our campaign by visiting N.D donaldjtrump.com or text Trump 28822 okay 2024 is our final battle with you at my side and you've been at my side from the beginning we will demolish the Deep State we'll expel we're going to expel those horrible horrible warmongers from our government they want to fight everybody they want to kill people all over the place places we've never heard about before places that want to be left alone we will drive out the globalist we will cast out the Communists marxists fascists we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country we will route the fake news media until they become real we will evict Joe Biden from the White House and we will finish the job that we started better than anybody has ever started a job before the great silent majority is rising like never before and under our leadership the Forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer you're going to be forgotten no longer with your help your love and your vote we will put America First and today especially in honor of our great veterans on Veterans Day we pledge to you that we will root out the Communists marxists fascist and the radical left thugs that live like Vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections and will do anything possible they'll do anything whether legally or illegally to destroy America and to destroy the American dream the real threat is not from the radical right right the real threat is from the radical left and it's growing every day every single day the threat from outside forces is far less Sinister dangerous and Grave than the threat from within our threat is from within because if you have a capable competent smart tough leader Russia China North Korea they're not going to want to play with us and they didn't despite the hate hatred and anger of the radical left lunatics who want to destroy our country we will make America great again thank you New Hampshire God bless you God bless you all thank you God bless you all thank you thank [Music] you you [Applause] [Music]
