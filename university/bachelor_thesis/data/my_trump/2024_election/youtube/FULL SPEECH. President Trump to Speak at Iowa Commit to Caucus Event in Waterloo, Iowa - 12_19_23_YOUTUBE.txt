a very merry Christmas do you remember do you remember about uh 7 
years ago I came I said they're going to be saying Merry Christmas again because 
uh Department Stores of course they have other problems now they're being robbed the department stores right now 
they have very big problems you know four 500 people run into them grab everything run out nothing happens 
because our law enforcements not allowed to do their job they're great they're not allowed to do their job so they have 
other problems too but they say Merry Christmas now at least and uh it's very 
important that was a big deal and now nobody even thinks about it we say Merry Christmas I'm honored by that we're just 
27 days away from Iowa's first in the nation thank you very much president Trump because you're first in the nation 
because I said you were first in the nation it's very simple and the caucuses are a big deal 
on Monday January 15th we're going to win the Iowa caucuses and then we're going to crush crooked Joe Biden next 
November and we're going to very simply make America great again thank you thank 
you Pastor I want to thank a very special person she stepped up very early and 
very strong and she's highly respected I think she's probably the most uh we have to call everyone a politician I guess if 
you run for office I think she's probably your most popular politician right now in Iowa Brena bird your 
attorney General thank you Brena thank you Dar she's been incredible a man who uh 
endorsed me before I was even running I said who's this guy from Iowa that keeps talking about Trump and he's a very I 
call him the Marboro man he's a handsome guy state Senator Brad zon Brad Brad 
where's Brad thank you Brad thank you very much 
he's been great he really I mean he was endorsing me before I ran I said who is that guy but he was probably the first 
Who is Bobby Kaufman 
one in the whole country state representatives Bobby Kaufman who's fantastic by the way his father's his 
father's fantastic too Derek wolf Craig 
Johnson and of course Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufman there's a slight 
relationship there thank you very much thank you everybody and a great job and it's it's 
fantastic to be with you we'll be back a few more times believe it or not we have that big day coming up we'll be back we 
got to be sure that we put this thing away the poll numbers are scary because 
we're leading by so much the key is you have to get out and vote because you know I tell it all the time if you don't 
get out and vote we can put this to bed after IA if you want to know the truth 
we can put it to bed for them too they can go home and forget it but you have to go out don't sit home and say you 
know I think we'll take it easy darling it's a wonderful day beautiful let's just take it easy watch television and 
watch the results now because crazy things can happen you got to get out this is really important our country is 
at stake we have a country that's never been in trouble like it is right now so 
get out and vote whether we're leading in the polls or not leading in the polls and in this case we're leading by 30 to 
40 points I guess but we got to win maybe we can win by more than that cuz you know if we 
win if we win in a massive number but it's a little bit less than that they'll 
say oh he didn't meet expectations it was ter because they're fake news we 
know that you know they're fake news they are the biggest fakers in the world 
during this holiday season families all across America are struggling under the brutal weight of crooked Joe's failures 
disasters heartless betrayals and inflation while the stock market is 
making rich people richer been and and I mean it's crazy what's going on rich people are getting richer of course I'm 
a politician now so we just keep chugging along right but it's making but you're going to have a crash the likes 
of which you haven't seen because of what they're doing it's going to be scary Biden's inflation catastrophe is 
demolishing your savings and ravaging your dreams his Skyhigh Energy prices 
the highest we've ever had are brutalizing your wallets our border is and erace criminals are running wild in 
our Democrat run cities and thanks to Crooked Joe's breathtaking weakness the world is going up in Flames the whole 
world is Up in Flames you didn't have any of this stuff when I was President I'd call and I'd say you can't do that 
to the head of a country and they wouldn't do it and Russia would have never done 
it and Hamas would never have done it because Iran wouldn't have given him the 
money or had the money to do it no it's very terrible what's going on hard to 
believe actually Joe Biden and the Democrat Party are incapable of solving any problems crooked Joe Biden is a low 
IQ individual he is truly the worst most incompetent and most corrupt president 
in the history of our country other than that I think quite a bit of 
him can can you believe what's going on in our country can you believe what's going on with the Border you watch and 
the you know the fake news doesn't want to show it too much certain of them and uh I will tell you what's going on in 
our border they're coming in by the millions and we have no idea who they are coming from all over the world but 
with your vote this election together we're going to save America and we're going to bring our country back from 
Hell our country has been in hell not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden under the Trump 
Administration you were better off your family was better off your neighbors were better off and our country was was 
better off and you're also much safer when you had me behind the desk of the 
Oval Office you were better off 5 years ago think of it just ask yourself were 
you better off 5 years ago or are you better off today with the inflation with bacon that cost you four times higher 
than you would have had to pay a little while ago it's going up nobody's ever said anything like it but what a difference a president makes a  president 
makes a big difference since Joe Biden took over we've had a three-year inflation rate of over 20% under my 
leadership inflation was non-existent and we had gasoline at $187 a 
gallon after 3 years of bomic the average monthly mortgage has gone from 
$1,700 under my Administration to $3,400 under this terrible 
Administration as long as Joe Biden is in the White House the American dream is 
dead it's dead there is no American Dream but all of that will change the 
minute the polls slows on Election night 2024 it's going to all 
change the next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked 
Joe Biden is gone and Donald J Trump and us all of us together have won four more 
years as president of the United States it's a very important thing because our country is really it's a disaster it's 
not even believable what's happened to our country in a period of three years powered by the momentum of our historic 
Victory by Christmas of next year it's a couple of months later by Christmas of next year the economy will be roaring 
back Energy prices will be plummeting the hordes of people charging across our border will have totally ended the 
invasion will have stopped 
and I heard somebody today say one of these genius analysts the 
stock markets good Rich get richer but the stock market's good because they think Trump is going to win the 
election and I believe that's true and whatever good they have right now is the 
fumes of what we left them it's coming off the fumes of what we've left them 
but the stock market is good because a lot of people think we're going to win the election so that's an interesting uh 
an interesting fact I felt that but I didn't want to say it but I think we will say it because just like three 
years ago they will know that I will catch and when you have people that are pouring across the border at levels like 
uh no country has ever seen not us no country's ever seen third world Nations have never seen they'd stop them with 
sticks and stones I say but they'll know that I'll catch them and we'll send them 
home and the entire world will be safer and more peaceful because everyone will know know that the days of Biden 
surrenders are over so many mistakes there been nothing good that's happened nothing good what good has happened in 
the last three years our country's gone to hell as soon as I get back in the Oval Office I'll also immediately end 
the war on Christians I don't know if you feel it you have a war there's a 
war under crooked Joe Biden Christians and Americans of Faith are being 
persecuted and government has been weaponized against religion like never before and also 
presidents like never before here I am I always say Al Capone was treated better 
than I was treated Scarface Sal Capone he was a tough one Biden and his corrupt Department of 
Injustice have sent SWAT teams to arrest pro-life activists they've targeted 
conservative parents at Schoolboard meetings who don't want filth taught to 
their children it's filth what they're teaching in schools is filth and nonsense and we can't let that 
happen but they're being targeted and now the Communist marxists and fascists are going hard after Catholics even 
plotting to send spies into Catholic churches it's all come out just like in the Soviet Union from days gone by now 
think of it if you're Catholic why would you vote for a Democrat what they're doing to Catholics I don't know what's 
going on with the Catholics but they're really being persecuted 
why would you vote for Biden and why would you vote for a Democrat a new report from the house Judiciary 
Committee proves that the Biden FBI actually targeted Catholics as potential domestic terrorists you believe this and 
you know uh evangelicals will not be far behind because when that starts it starts happening on a very major scale 
when I'm back in the White House never again will your government be used to Target Christians and other religious 
believers upon taking office I will create a new 
federal task force on fighting anti-christian bias to be led by a fully 
reformed Department of Justice that's fair and 
Equitable its Mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination harassment and 
persecution against Christians in America they are going after Christians in America who's who's can believe all 
this stuff it's not believable is it but it is fact it's just like so many of the 
other things when I stand up and I say that we will stop and I've said it we will stop men from participating in 
women's sports I mean the whole thing that you have no but things that you you 
say that you say that you can't believe you're up here and uh and saying it we 
we are for parental rights you have to say that no no think of it we are for parental right who believes that 10 
Americans of Faith 
years ago 15 years ago who would ever have to say a thing like that we're for parental rights of course we're for 
parental rights but the Democrats aren't they're fascists they're not they want School boards they want people to take 
your children and do things with your children that are not even speakable Americans of Faith are not a threat to 
our country Americans of Faith are the soul of our country and they have been from the 
beginning I will defend religion and I will defend In God We Trust we we will 
defend In God We Trust which is and you know that very important 
phrase is undeas you do know that right we will defend it 100% when Joe Biden 
lit the National Christmas Tree earlier this month he completely failed to even mention the birth of Jesus Christ which 
is hard to do if you celebrating Christmas right he didn't mention Jesus 
Christ and his remarks not for three years years he hasn't mentioned that and 
barely mentioned God when I was President we brought back the beautiful phrase merry Christmas and I said I do 
that I'm very proud of that actually because as I said at the beginning that was really UND sieg and when I lit the 
Christmas tree each year it was my honor to publicly celebrate the true source of 
Christmas Joy which is Jesus Christ as president I kept every promise 
I made to Christians and more and I think everybody in this room understands that very well that's pretty well 
documented in our first four years we appointed nearly 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court Justices I 
stood up for religious liberty at home and all around the world I protected innocent life and I defended the 
judeo-christian values of our nation's founding I proudly recognize Israel's 
Eternal capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem which which is a big 
thing I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and 
you know they were looking to get that for 72 years they'd fly in they'd fly 
out they'd fly in they'd every year they'd fly in they discuss it that fly out and I got it done in about 12 
minutes we got it done very quickly and with the historic Abraham Accords I even made peace in the Middle East 
Unfortunately they haven't taken it any further it should have been taken we could have had everybody signed up it's 
no wonder crooked Joe Biden and the far-left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary they willing 
to violate the US constitutions at levels never seen before in order to win this election Joe Biden is a threat to 
democracy it's a threat they're weaponizing law 
enforcement for highlevel election interference because we're beating them so badly in the polls the new CBS poll 
remember I always used to talk about polls but only if they were good I don't mention them if they were bad I had a 
tendency if they were bad I didn't talk about them right I don't know that's probably sort of like a little bit like the fake news would do so I feel very 
embarrassed by it but the new CBS poll just out has us 
at 58% in the state with the sanctimonious 40 points behind us 40 
points the new morning console poll that's in your say the conso Paul has us 
at 66% Nationwide with the Sanctus at 11% and haly at 
11% and then they said Haley is surging because she went from 9 to 11 I went up 
seven points she went up two points and it's harder to go up Seven when you're almost at the top there's not that many 
points left so I went up seven she went up two and the headline was Hal is surging because she caught the sanct 
demonius the fox pole has this trouncing the primary field at 69% with the 
Sanctus at 13% and Haley at 9 and you know it's sort of interesting he did an 
interview the other day and the announcer this was sort of a straight interview at a major Network ladies and 
gentlemen it's a great honor to have Governor run desanctis with us no no it's DeSantis it's so that's good 
branding do you agree that's good n but he is sanctimonious in the 
new rash buus pole of the general election we're dominating by 10 11 12 
even 14 points and the Washington Post had it up 11 and then they said oh there must be this must be an outlier they 
spent a million and a half dollars on a poll The Washington Post and they Panic 
they say this must be an outlier this is the first time anyone ever had a poll and they said we think our poll must be 
wrong but we have even better numbers than that no they're going crazy but none of this matters if you don't show 
up to support us on January 15th and again in November 5th so it's again the same thing you got to show up even if 
Winning by a Lot 
you think we're going to win by a lot you got to show up because winning by a lot lot is uh very meaningful even as 
countries watch from afar because we would never have any of these problems 
of our president but when they see the kind of support that we have we have incredible support we have more support 
than we did in 2020 or 2016 and we did great we won 2016 and then we did then 
we did even better by a lot by millions and millions of votes in 2020 it was a rigged 
election the radical left Democrats rig the presidential election of 2020 and 
we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024 we're not 
going to allow every time the radical left 
Democrats marxists communist and fascists indict me I consider it 
actually a great badge of honor thank you very much I appreciate thank you 
very much cuz I'm being indicted for you never forget our enemies want to take 
away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom it's very simple I'm not going to let them do 
it they want to silence me because I will never let them silence you and in 
the end they're not after me they're after you I just happen to be standing in their way and I always will stand in 
their way and you know I've been saying this a lot 
lately because I see the kind of crowds we go up to these uh large areas we come out to the rural areas no matter where 
we go we have packed houses packed houses some of them we filled up an arena last time a massive Arena we had 
thousands of people outside couldn't get in Brad was there couldn't get in this 
is he got in we almost said keep him out let's 
keep him out right now he's he's always always going to be invited this is far more than a campaign this is the 
greatest political movement in the history of our country that's what it is this is a great political movement this 
is not just a campaign and together we will once again fight for Iowa families 
and Iowa Farmers just as we did four straight years we fought for you we've done more for the state of Iowa than any 
president ever in history there's never been a because when you add it all up what we've done unlike crooked Joe who 
wants a dramatic increased the estate tax or the death tax as they call it I virtually eliminated the unfair death 
tax saving countless Farms from and families and families of farmers they 
love their children they leave their farmer their Farm to the children and the tax was so incredible that the 
children would often have to file bankruptcy because they had to go borrow money to pay the estate tax or the death 
tax and I eliminated that tax I eliminated so now you can leave if you love your children if you don't love 
your children then I haven't done that much for you but some people love their children does everybody in this room 
love their children I [Music] do does anybody in this room not love 
their children raise your oh that guy in the blue jacket raises but no it's very important 
because uh people were going to The Heirs you know you inherit a farm you have a 40 50% tax to pay and they fight 
with you over the tax and they end up going to the bankers the banks are just have been so bad not the local B there 
some of these big banks have been horrible horrible people running them 
but you know uh the banks they loan the money and they end up taking over the farm we're not doing that so we ended 
the estate tax and farms and small businesses now they don't have to go into Hawk and end up losing everything 
and the parents are very happy about that they're looking down and they're saying I'm so happy I love president 
Trump because that was a big that was a big thing I ended the NAFTA disaster the 
worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with the US MCA the best trade deal ever made and that was a giant win for 
Iowa Farmers I took on the Communist Chinese like no Administration in 
history communist China was doing a number on the farmers and you know it better than anybody bringing hundreds of 
billions of dollars pouring into our treasury when no other president had gotten 10 cents from China nobody had 
ever brought in any money I brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China in fact China is not now doing 
very well and a lot of people think it was because of what I did with respect to all of the hundreds of billions I 
brought in and Biden is unable to cancel it because it's so much money that it's 
having a hard time canceling it's hard to say oh gee let's not do that for hundreds of billions of dollars and then 
I gave the farmers 28 billion dollar straight out of the tariffs I took in 
from China a large part of which came right back to the state of Iowa 
right that's why my people in the back you know my great genius is sir please 
don't say that to often because you sound very conceited when you say that you guarantee that Iowa is going to vote 
Guaranteeing Iowa 
for you you guarantee Iowa I said I got him $28 billion of course who else is 
going to get him 28 billion I said go out and buy more land and larger 
tractors do you remember that but you know what they stuck with me because we had a period of six or seven months with 
China you are the great negotiators they were playing hard ball but we ended up winning and they by now we made a trade 
deal with China I don't even talk about it because of Co but we made one of the greatest trade deals ever made they buy 
$50 billion doll worth of product from this country and they were buying nothing before that they were buying 
nothing so it was an amazing thing that happened and uh it's an honor to have done it and I do believe I could say 
that but I won't say it I will not say that because my people have said so I will not guarantee it but I pretty much 
guarantee it okay let's vote against let's vote against Trump because he gave 
us $28 billion I don't know somehow they got a problem with that one don't they huh the people that are running against 
us and who frankly were not in favor of farmers you know Ronda sanctimonious was 
not a friend of the farmer he fought against the farm bill he fought against ethanol 
hard very hard now all of a sudden he loves ethanol about two weeks ago it started right no one gets abused on 
trade worse than American agriculture yet no other president lifted a finger for you nobody lifted a finger for you 
in Iowa nobody under my leadership we will have a great Rebirth of loyalty to 
the American Farmer and loyalty to the American 
flag and I'm going to pass something that's 
so important we were just about set to do that we had the greatest economy in history we're just about set and then we 
hit covid covid came a gift from China from Wuhan I told him it came from the 
Wuhan lab I said it right from the beginning I never changed Trump you ever see the hats Trump was right about 
everything some of the things I don't want to be right about like I think our country is in more danger now for World 
War III than ever before I don't want to be right about that but uh we have a man 
who's grossly incompetent and he's talking about nuclear weapons and negotiations he doesn't even know what 
they Le talk he can't even he can't even find the stairs to get off the stage right there they are there they 
Jim Jones 
are they're all over the place jump off the front but don't walk into the back wall you ever see that he finishes a 
speech if you call it that he did a news conference the other day and he goes uh 
okay let's say you know I did news conferences in the white you you you you 
you you he did a new Jim 
Jones of NBC oh is he here oh the guy says Mr President uh what about this 
what about that what about that I would like to tell you the 
following he's reading the answer meaning meaning he knows the questions and they write down the answer he reads 
the answer if I ever did that they would impeach me a third time right they would impeach me 
a third we beat him twice you know they impeached me then 
they found out I was right they were all saying we really shouldn't have impeached him but actually the 
Republicans and and Jim Jordan's great and Jaimie is doing a great job but the 
Republicans are being much nicer because they're saying let's do an inquiry first they didn't do an inquiry with me I walk 
in they impeached me so they these are these are bad people bad people I will 
pass the Trump reciprocal trade act so that means if China or any other country 
make us pay a 100% or 200% tariff which they do we will make them pay a 
reciprocal tariff identical Tariff of 100 to 200% right back we'll take in 
billions and billions now what will happen is they'll end the tax you know they'll end the tax but we we're all set 
together that we would have had that quickly I will revoke China's most favored nation trade status and we will 
impose stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers because they abuse us but many people abuse us on on trade 
and even the military at the same time I will end Joe Biden's war and American Energy and we will ready drill baby 
drill we will drill 
drill we'll put straws in the ground and we have oil coming up we have more oil than anybody oil and gas we have more 
Energy 
than any other country in the world and you know we took it from fourth place to first place in just a short period of 
time we were going to make so much money we were making so much we're energy independent think of that gas prices oil 
prices down so low record numbers in some cases but down so low and we were going to sell it all over the world fill 
up our strategic Reserve which I was doing very cheaply by comparison to what they're doing now he used the money just 
to have a better election he used a lot of the money they drained it's the lowest point it's ever been right now 
that's meant for military that's meant for real problems not to keep your gasoline price down so that you can get 
some votes during an election but they brought it down to the lowest level in order to try and remain relevant for an 
election it's very terrible what they've done they've done a lot of bad things as part of our Common Sense energy policies 
I will once again stand up for Iowa ethanol like I have done I've been your 
SA many people did not want anybody to 
stand up for it I just promised as president I issued a historic rule 
declaring that E15 would be made available all year round you know what that means I did it all year it was 
eight months and I did it all year round nobody thought that was going to happen and letting them use the existing pumps 
now that doesn't sound very glamorous but it was hundreds of millions of dollars would have had to be spent that 
would have been an increase in price to you and I let them use the existing pumps I I very simple I brought in 
experts I said well what's the difference I said well sir the old ones are actually better I know that because a lot of times equipment is much better 
the older equipment is a lot better than the new equipment and uh like grass 
cutters all you have in a grass cutter today is environmental computers and Equipment they forgot to put blades on 
it to cut the grass so sometimes you'd rather have like a blade give me a blade to cut the 
grass in contrast to my wavering support for Iowa ethanol and agriculture Ronda 
San tonius wants to literally bankrupt Iowa Farmers that's what he' do because his policies are horrible the Sanctus 
spent his entire political career vindictively trying to kill the ethanol industry voting again and again to 
devastate Iowa Farmers by eliminating the billions of dollars generated each year from ethanol and wiping out 48,000 
Iowa jobs he voted against it unlike the sanctis I will be your ethanol Champion 
for four more years you have four more years of security and I will also rescue the 
ethanol industry by cancelling crooked Joe Biden's insane ethanol killing electric vehicle 
mandate on day one everything has to be elected electric cars they don't go far 
they cost too much they're all going to be made in China the United workers are going to all be voting for Trump because 
they're going to this mandate is going to kill all jobs all jobs they've lost so many now to Mexico 32% went to Mexico 
many went to Canada and the rest went to China whatever we have left it's peanuts compared to what it should have been but 
uh this electric car thing is just crazy it if you want to drive maybe let's say 
you're here if you say let's take a drive to beautiful safe Chicago it's so 
safe let's drive there how many times would you have to stop about nine you know 
it's it's just crazy it's these people and they know it they know it's crazy they don't want to even listen to people 
same thing with the trucking industry they want to have electric trucks so a truck a big beautiful truck like Peter 
Bill the one of them they can go the big ones they can go 18 wheelers they can go 
uh about about 2,000 miles they say 2,000 on a big tank of diesel 
and uh an electric truck comparable which it can't be comparable because you need so much room for the battery most 
of the area that you're going to carry your goods going to be battery but assuming we take away that 
problem which is not easy to take away uh you'd have to stop approximately seven times to go 2,000 miles right you 
go about 300 miles and uh they don't want to change that you think after one 
if I were sitting there and that was explained to me and verified I would say 
of course you're not going to do that we'll destroy our supply chain but uh the Attorney General would agree with me 
I mean you don't have to be a great expert to know you can't do that one goes 2,000 mil and the other one goes 
300 miles and you don't have any capacity because half of it's got to be for battery the batteries are massive 
crooked Joe puts China first he puts Asia first Ukraine first illegal aliens first environmental Maniacs first he 
puts everyone first but he puts America last he puts Iowa will last he puts our 
workers last he puts our Farmers last and he puts everything that's good last and by the way they abandoned Iowa you 
They abandoned Iowa 
saw that right they left Iowa I don't think he's going to do too well here you know they used to be together with them 
but they've gone now to another state good State also by the way but they've gone they've left a tradition I said 
we're never going to do that we're never going to do that I you know it's got a great political tradition 
I put Iowa first 
and I kept Iowa first that was me I put 
Iowa first and I will put America First every single time I put our country 
first so job number one when we return to the White House will be to restore 
peace through strength peace through strength for four straight years I kept 
America safe I kept Israel safe I kept Ukraine safe there was no talk of this 
and I kept the entire world safe a great gentleman Victor Orban Uh Hungry he's 
the leader he's the boss he's everything you want to call him he's tough guy tough very well I mean he knows Russia 
very well he knows Ukraine very well they were saying what do you think is going on with the world he said what's 
going on with the world is Trump isn't there anymore we didn't have any of these problems he said what would you 
suggest bring Trump back as president of the United States and you won't have any 
of these problems he said when Trump was there these leaders China Russia all of them 
they were afraid of the United States they feared the United States they respected him and I thought it was a 
nice statement so I repeat it as often as I can because I know one thing the Press is not going to repeat it you know 
you might as well repeat it yourself this is a lesson repeat it yourself because they're not going to be repeating it I'm I'm the only candidate 
I think you know this who can make a very important promise so I think the world's in more danger than it's ever 
been because of the power of weapons R and I will be the only one that can say this with great shity I will prevent 
World War II World War I we're very close I don't know if you feel it I 
don't know Madame attorney general if you feel it but we're very close to World War III when you see these 
discussions taking place you know we had an axium never ever talk nuclear never 
mention the word nuclear it was not a word that was mentioned because the power is so ridiculous and we didn't 
mention it now all the time you're hearing nuclear from them from them you're hearing it from 
other countries it it was unacceptable it was a word that you couldn't say and 
all of a sudden you're hearing that word all the time and this wouldn't be a war like with army tanks running back and 
forth shooting at each other World War I World War I this would be obliteration this would be the worst thing that's has 
never been this would be obliteration you cannot use the word you cannot 
discuss that word but I rebuilt our military to a level that it's never been before and that includes that you know 
our nuclear stockpile I I have no choice I hated doing it but it's it's all tippy top 
it's all really in the best of condition now we had stuff that we didn't we had no idea if it even worked it was 40 
years old and the wires to the phones didn't even work nothing worked and all 
of everything's been rebuilt we've done a great job really an amazing job and 
the only reason we had to do that is because China is building their heart out with nuclear in Russia as you know 
has comparable to us so it's uh it's a very dangerous position when you see uh 
the words that are being spewed and I'm saying and I'm watching it I'm watching his language and his body language I'm 
saying he's saying the exact opposite of what should be said we're very unsafe 
and we have 11 months to go you know that's a long time time they can do a lot of damage in 11 months under the 
Trump Administration we had the most secure Border in US history by four we built 561 miles of borderwall and got 
Mexico to give us 28,000 soldiers free of charge that was much more than as I 
said we'll get Mexico to pay for a big portion of it this is much more we have 28,000 I had 28,000 soldiers free of 
charge I said to him you're going to have to give us 28,000 soldiers we need that they said no no no no we will not 
do that I said of course you will they said we uh we will not do that why would we do a thing like that they said you're 
going to have to do it uh I'm sorry but you're going to have to do it and they said no and then I said here's what's 
going to happen on Monday morning at 7:00 we're going to impose a 25% tariff or tax on all of your goods 
including the cars that you stole away from us in terms of manufacturing of cars you know they have 32% of our car 
car production was taken away Years Ago by Mexico 32% but every car is going to have a 25% 
tax on it and we're going to take in so much money and then they turned around and they said we would like to make a 
phone call to Mexico please sir they come in the room 5 minutes later and they said it would be our great honor to 
supply you with 28,000 soldiers and we had 28,000 soldiers and we had very few 
We had the best record 
people we had the best record this is as we're building the wall then I was going to add another 200 miles to the wall 
that we had just completed because all of a sudden you needed more because it's like you know that's the way it works 
right they come have to walk a little bit further out we're going to add another 200 and then what happened is uh 
we had a rigged election and Biden came in and he said uh we don't want any walls we want to have open borders and 
nobody could believe it and I you know when I heard that during the campaign I figured maybe it's a you know just words 
but who could be so stupid who could be so horrible to our country what they're doing to our country they actually meant 
it because they took all of the wall that I had ready to just be installed could have been done in 3 weeks and they 
took that wall and they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar and it was all the exact stuff that border patrol wanted we 
had wires in it for technology we had concrete rebar and very hardened steel 
that's exactly what and they had to have openings to see I was going to put up concrete Plank and it would have looked 
fine but uh no but think of it so sad and they actually sold a lot of it for 5 
cents and the dollar now they'll end up building it at some point because you know two things that work remember the 
old days with the campaigns I said there's only two things that work CU your phone that you have and your computer that you have in about two 
weeks it's obsolete you have to buy a new one the two things that work are wheels and walls right wheels will 
always be there and walls will always be there they're the only two things that will never get obsolete now we have a 
border of catastroph rhy like in uh nobody's ever seen really anything 
like it nobody's I mean if you look today over the last frankly look over the last three years but you look now 
it's so bad it's like nothing in the history of the world yesterday we had a 
single highest day record of illegal border crossings ever recorded 12,600 one day we have no idea who any 
of them are they come from Africa they come from Asia they come from South 
America but not just South America they're all over the world they dump them on the border and they pour into 
our country and nobody's there to check them and the border patrol is incredible by the way they want to do it but they're told not to do their job it's 
crazy what's going on they're ruining our country and it's true they're destroying 
the blood of our country that's what they're doing they're destroying our country they don't like it when I said 
that and I never read mine they said oh Hitler said that in a much different way no they're coming 
from all over the world people all over the world we have no idea they could be healthy they could be very unhealthy 
they could bring in disease that's going to catch on in our country but they do bring in crime but they have them coming 
from all over the world and they're destroying the blood of our country they're destroying the fabric of our 
country and we're going to have to get them out we're going to have to get Mass numbers of these especially the 
criminals they're coming from jails prisons they're coming from mental institutions they say please don't say 
the words insane asylum but I have to say it they they're emptying out the insane asylums from all over the world 
why wouldn't they I would do it if I were running Guatemala El Salvador 
Honduras Mexico they're emptying out their prisons into our country how stupid are 
we to allow this to happen this week the Biden Administration closed two vital 
Railway Crossings so that border agents could be redirected to help process even 
more migrants they were coming in you saw the trains with thousands and thousands of people on top of them and 
in them thousands and thousands of people pouring into our country and we 
actually allow them to come in they process them where do you come from where were you I was in a jail oh okay 
you can come in come on they let anybody in and you have other people that study you probably saw Melania this week where 
she held a great beautiful reception for people that came into our country legally they studied they worked they 
had to take exams they had to talk about our flag and and George Washington and everything 
else it was a beautiful day but that's the way it's about because we want people to come in but they have to come 
in Legally but what's happening now is this the whole system is being underrun and no country can sustain this by the 
way you know you have children going to school they don't speak the language you have children going to school speaking 
They dont speak the language 
languages that nobody even knows what the language is there are many languages in the world they don't even know what 
the language is and they're sitting in classrooms and there's no room for our students in the classrooms and they 
don't speak the language on my first day back in the white house I will terminate every open border policy of the Biden 
Administration Stop The Invasion on our Southern border and begin the large 
domestic deportation operation in American history we have no choice no 
country can sustain this we will restore Law and Order to our communities and I 
will direct a completely overhaul doj to investigate every radical outof control 
prosecutor of which we have many in America I have a guy named deranged Jack 
Smith he's a deranged person he happens to be after me you know the great one is 
the boxes hoax they have a box say Biden has been taking stuff out of the White House or taking out wherever he was he 
was a senator for 50 years he's got tremendous amounts of stuff he had it 
brought to Chinatown what's that all about and then after it was brought that was distributed to different places 
Chinatown and it leaked to CNN of course cuz they leaked the prosecutors Leake 
that he's not going to have any problem but me with a tiny amount I come under the presidential records act which gives 
me the absolute right to do it with me oh I'm different but mine was in a 
secure location everything was Tippy tap but you know with this guy just think 
about it they don't want to do anything they're not going to do anything it just came out they released it they leaked it 
they leak it because they're dishonest you're not supposed to leak that they talk about classified documents and they're leaking about classified 
documents but he had many classified documents just think about it and and they leak that he's going to be okay he 
did nothing wrong he did everything wrong and he made it impossible for them and he took things when he was a Senator 
which dick Durban is on television he's a senator Democrat he's saying oh if he did that that's a crime that's a 
terrible thing and he never came under the presidential records act because he was vice president and he was a Senator 
but for him it's okay for me and I have Total Protection I'm allowed to do it you know the New York 
Times wrote an article and uh I'm sure the wrer got fired but basically it said 
please please please Mr President and that was title something like that please please please 
Mr President like James Brown did you have here please please please please please please Mr President may we have 
they said the only right they have is to say Please Mr President may we have them because I'm entitled to them and this 
was in the New York Times big big article and yet they leak that Biden has 
no problem problem but they continue cuz I have a deranged prosecutor he's a deranged person and uh the good news is 
people get it that's why my poll numbers are so high I believe because you know I would I would 
really I would really have I think we'd be winning by a lot but now we're winning by numbers that nobody can 
believe I think it's why our poll numbers because they see this persecution that goes on in this uh two 
tiers of Justice or Injustice and they don't like it they don't want want that this is not what America is all about so 
I appreciate everything and I appreciate all the support we get because that makes a big a MIG difference when you 
have poll numbers we're at you know where we're like literally 80 and 90 points higher in some cases and some of 
these guys we have guys running like from Arkansas he's been at zero for seven months aah Hutchinson I call him 
aah it's ASA the only reason I corrected is I say he didn't know his name he didn't know his name he must be 
cognitive you don't forget I do most of this stuff without teleprompters they do 
Biden no if I say aah Hutchinson oh they'll do it anyway I just gave him an idea look they're starting right they'll 
say he didn't know his name no it's ASA but I call him AA but this guy has been he's the governor of Arkansas he's got 
the personality of that floor tile see the tile there's a broken tile right there 
that's about as much personality and he's a nasty guy he's got zero for how 
many months has he been running like a year for a year he's been running he's at zero Chris Christie who's got a 
serious case of trump derangement syndrome he's sick between him and Liz Cheney does she have Trump derangement 
syndrome or what no and I let Scooter liby out you know 
it's a friend of their family they didn't do anything for for him I did they didn't get him out I got him out I gave him a pardon because he was treated 
very unfairly scooter Libby but he was a very good friend of the Cheney family they didn't do anything for him I did 
but you know uh You' think they'd be thankful for that but they don't talk about that they say I'm a threat to democracy no Joe Biden is a threat to 
Im a threat to democracy 
democracy by all of the things that we talk about but I'm also going to 
indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States for being destroyed by the 
radical left for taking strong action on crime these are people they want to destroy them because they want to put 
criminals away they're forced to do nothing they cannot do anything when 
they want to they do want to they're the greatest people the police and I just met a lot of them in the back backstage 
they all like incredible people but you know they're under threat of losing 
their pension their house and their family and losing everything if you touch these people I mean you you let 
that what's going on where the people are going into these stores and robbing them and even the clerks they fire 
clerks if they try and stop them I mean if I had a clerk that was willing to stop them I would say you are the 
greatest you love our our country our company our store and they fire them 
it's like crazy there's something going on our brains are being fried there's something going on but our police know 
everything and they can solve these crime problems very quickly but they're not allowed to do it and they don't want to lose their their families they don't 
want to lose their house and their pension we're not going to let that happen anymore so what I'm going to do is give indemnifications to any police 
officer that gets in trouble for pursuing a criminal because that's what 
we have to do in addition we will take over our 
horribly run Washington DC and clean up renovate and rebuild our Capital so that 
it no longer is a nightmare of murder and crime it's people are being murdered there every day murdered in our Capital 
can you imagine when these people come from foreign countries and they not may not be rich but their capitals are safe 
they have no crime they take care of it fast but can you imagine they come into they s and they read that three people 
were murdered last night in Washington DC and they have graffiti all over the place that on those beautiful marble 
columns they have graffiti all over the place graffiti graffiti graffiti the streets they look like I mean I 
drove into Washington a few weeks ago for a court case one of the many I 
should get to know it very well very I can't get a fair trial on watch the whole thing is ridiculous but but for a 
court case I'm driving over a road where it's almost all paper garbage and you know you can see paper I know paper I 
know cans when cans start to literally rot when paper is rotting it's been 
there for a long time nobody cleans up anything the medians the dividers they're all broken and falling down it 
looks like an absolute slum and when foreign leaders come into Washington and 
they see that I don't care how good you are as a president they go back and they say that country's got a lot of problems 
we're going to clean it up we're going to make it the most beautiful Capital anywhere in the 
world our Parks will be cleaned all tents and graffiti will be removed you 
have to see some of these beautiful parks that you remember five years ago you'd go there they were so beautiful 
and safe but you take a look at some of these Parks you can't even see the grass there people all over the place living 
there with tents slum areas will be demolished and rebuilt to the highest level of architectural Elegance we're 
going to have to do that I know it sounds rough but we're going to have to do that Washington DC will become a 
symbol of beauty security freedom and strength again we have to have that we can't let this happen they've taken over 
the capital in addition to our Capital we're going 
to rebuild our cities into beacons of Hope and safety and Beauty better than they've ever been before I mean you're 
not thinking too much about that in Iowa but you know you want to see your country be great it will be the greatest 
investment ever made in them and we're going to work closely with Democrat leaders they're all run by democrats and 
they're all doing horribly and all of these failing places we're going to make sure that this rebuilding will be a 
lasting and very compassionate one we're going to rebuild our cities and we're going to strengthen up crime at a level 
like nobody can believe you're going to be able to uh be safe again safety will be restored so that children can go 
outside with their mothers and fathers and play in the park without being beat up molested or 
shot students can walk to school in peace they used to walk to school today 
you need an armored vehicle to take them to school crime rates will plummet and people will long be they're going to be 
be really longing to move back into the city you know when I was young I well my dream was to move into Manhattan I 
wanted to build buildings in Manhattan oh that was my dream and today people are leaving you know they're leaving 
they're afraid to stay in the cities unlike the Sanctus will always protect Social Security and Medicare he was 
against Social Security he was willing to take Social Security and do numbers on it and slice 
Medicare 
and dice but he also wanted to move the minimum age up to 7 that's a big move for people because you you don't listen 
we have so much liquid gold under our feet we don't have to do that stuff we don't have to do that why should seniors 
be hurt with Medicare and Social Security we're also going to fight to 
give you much better health care because Obamacare as you know is a catastrophe for American families and as I say even 
Elizabeth Warren who often is referred to as you know as Pocahontas because of her great Indian Heritage but she even 
agrees that it needs to be fixed it has to be fixed it's too expensive for the people and we're going to get it done we 
almost had it done but then John McCain voted it down after campaigning for 10 years to kill it John McCain voted it 
down too bad how was it too bad remember thumbs down that was not good we're 
going to make it much less expensive for the people with much much better healthare you're going to get that and 
we deserve it on day one I will sign a new executive of order to cut Federal 
funding for any school pushing critical race Theory Trends gender insanity and 
inappropriate racial sexual or political content on our 
children and I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate 
or a ma or a mask mandate a mask 
mandate and as I said before something that's very popular I can't believe I 
have to say it but I might as well I will keep men out of women's sports is that 
okay you see the weightlifting records they're being broken by hundreds of pounds one stood for I think 18 years 
Weightlifting 
over a quarter of an ounce they're coming in they're wiping it out like 158 
lbs so it's just so so demeaning to women the whole thing I mean women great 
athletes I mean it's just so unfair they can have records they'll have a let look eventually that's got to happen it's 
going to happen with me but you're going to have like these records where the record will be here but you'll have this 
blip for a period of three or four years be like that they're can to say they'll 
look back in a 100 years they'll say what the hell happened there who was that that was one strong woman wasn't it 
I will fully uphold the Second Amendment we will restore free speech and I will secure our 
elections our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID 
very simple but until then Republicans must win we have to win once we get in 
we'll change that but we have to win if you took the 10 worst Presidents in the history of the United States and added 
them up they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden Administration has 
done take the 10 remember I used to say five but you don't have to say five you 
could take the 10 worst Presidents and they would not have done the damage that he's done so if you want to save America 
from crooked Joe then get every Patriot you know make sure they are registered 
Republicans have to be registered Republicans and get them out to vote in their local Precinct caucuses at 700 
p.m. on Monday and I'm going to be here with you by the way January 
15th it's Martin Luther King holiday so it's a Martin Luther King day I'm going 
to be here here I'm going to be probably in De Mo or someplace I'll be some I'll 
be caucusing I'll be caucusing we don't want to take any chances right so I 
could sit home I didn't have to be they said sir do you want to go there you're in great shape I said no thanks I'm 
going because we have to make sure everybody gets out and if I don't get out that's no good right so we're going 
to make sure we get out we're asking you to commit to caucus for us and bring as 
many people as you can to caucus at our campaign sign up at I A.D 
donaldjtrump.com okay and in 
conclusion from Sous City to Iowa City from Fort Dodge to Cedar Rapids and de Mo to 
Davenport to right here in waterl we stand on the shoulders of generations of 
Iowa Patriots who have tamed the wilderness ra the elements till the soil you till that 
soil I tell you you still tilling the soil right you great people worked the fields built the factories and poured 
out their Blood Sweat and Tears to make this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world but now we are

strength we are a nation that has lost its way but we are not not going to 
allow this horror to continue we're not going to allow it to continue we can't let it continue the biggest election 
we've ever had is coming up 2024 you know I used to say that with 2016 this 
the biggest election I meant it but we didn't have we had a big border problem in fact I fixed it so good that in 2020 
we couldn't talk about the Border they say Sir nobody cares about the Border I said what do you mean it's the biggest thing you fixed it sir it was totally 
fixed and then what happened is not even believable this is the single biggest 
election in the history of our country this is going to determine whether or not we even have a country left because 
these people are destroying our country thean B three years ago we were a great 
nation and we will soon be a great nation 
again it was hardworking Patriots like you who built this country and it is 
hardworking Patriots like you who are going to save our country we will fight 
for America like no one has ever fought before 2024 is our final battle with you 
at my side we will demolish the Deep State we will expel the war 
mongers we will drive out the globalists we will cast out the Communist Marxist 
and fascist we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country 
we will route the fake news media we will evict Joe Biden from the White 
House and we will finish the job once and for 
all the great silent majority is rising like never before and under our 
leadership the Forgotten men and women the men and women of our country have 
been forgotten they will be forgotten no longer they weren't forgotten for 4 years you know that better than anybody 
nobody's ever done better than we did during that 4year period we will love our country we will take care of our 
country we will pray to God for our strength and for our Liberty we will pray for God and we will be with God We 
Are One movement one people one family and one glorious nation under God and 
together we will make America powerful [Applause]
