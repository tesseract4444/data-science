Mark Meadows: (00:00)
Mr. President, everyone is on the line. And just so this is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state, and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell, who is not the attorney of record but has been involved, myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I’ll turn it over to you.

President Trump: (00:38)
Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we’ve spent a lot of time on this and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it’s pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We’d be getting 25-30,000 people a rally and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense. But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3, anywhere from 250-300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn’t been checked. We think that if you check the signatures, a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County, you’ll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that’s going to happen.

President Trump: (01:42)
Another tremendous number. We’re going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants, but an accurate number will be given. But it’s in the fifties of thousands and that’s people that went to vote and they were told they can’t vote because they’ve already been voted for. And it’s a very sad thing. They walked out complaining, but the number is large we’ll have it for you, but it’s much more than the number of 11,779. The current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That’s something, I think, at least that’s a number that everyone agrees on. But that’s the difference in the votes. But we had hundreds of thousands of ballots that were able to… Actually, we’ll get you a pretty accurate number.

President Trump: (02:43)
You don’t need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn’t vote, were told they couldn’t vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that’s very, very, very, very sad. We had, I believe it’s about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren’t on the voter registration list. So it’s 4,502 who voted but they weren’t on the voter registration roll which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant and they’re not allowed to be counted. That’s 18,325. A smaller number, you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O., A post office box number.

President Trump: (03:53)
And they had a post office box number and that’s not allowed. We had at least 18,000, that’s on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly. 18,000 voters having to do with Ruby Freeman. She’s a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler Ruby Freeman. That was the tape that’s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else, where they got number one, they said very clearly. And it’s been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back Ruby Freeman and her daughter and a few people. There was no Republican poll Watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll Watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats either and there was no law enforcement.

President Trump: (04:55)
Early in the morning they went to the table with the black robe, the black shield and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before the table was put there. I think it was, Brad you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren’t in an official voter box, they were in what looked to be suitcases. But they weren’t in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion and it was magnified many times over and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden.

President Trump: (05:48)
You had out-of-state voters, they voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state of 4,925. You had absentee ballot sent to a vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses. That’s 2,326. And you had drop boxes, which is very bad. You had drop boxes that were picked up. We have photographs and we have affidavits from many people. I don’t know if you saw the hearings, but you have drop boxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box including, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by… We had vast, I mean, you have, the state is in turmoil over this, and I know you would like to get to the bottom of it.

President Trump: (07:01)
Although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, and I didn’t lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way… A lot of the political people said that there’s no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the… As you know, every single state… We won every state. We won every State House in the country. We held the Senate which is shocking to people, although we’ll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House. And we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there’s now a difference of five. That was supposed to be a different substantially more.

President Trump: (07:51)
But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that there was no way they’d beat me in the election that the people came out. In fact, they were expecting to lose. And then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said, there’s no way that they’ve done many polls prior to the election. There was no way that they won. Ballots were dropped in massive numbers and we’re trying to get to those numbers. And we will have them. They’ll take a period of time, certified. But they’re massive numbers and far greater than the 11,779. The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted. And I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number. And a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters. The bottom line is when you add it all up and then you start adding 300, 000 fake ballots.

President Trump: (09:04)
Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas, and this may or may not, because this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding ballots and removing equipment. They’re changing the equipment on the Dominion machines. And that’s not legal. And they supposedly shredded, I think they said 3000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it’s a very sad situation. But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers were many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified or they will be certified. But they are certified. Those are numbers that are there that exist. And that beat the margin, the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot.

President Trump: (10:11)
And people should be happy to have an accurate count, instead of an election where there’s turmoil. I mean there’s turmoil in Georgia and other places. You’re not the only one. I mean, we have other States that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. But this is something that’s, as an example, I think in Detroit, and I think there’s a good section of your state actually, which we’re not sure, so we’re not going to report it yet. But in Detroit we had, I think it was 139% of the people voted. That’s not too good. And Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn’t play too well. And the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. But I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had, as an example of Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted, I think Mark it was 18,000.

President Trump: (11:22)
Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours. You were in the 4 to 5,000 category. And that was checked out laboriously by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers. So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line and provisional ballots, again, you’ll have to tell me about the provisional ballots. But we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren’t able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people. And they were shell shocked. I don’t know if you’d call that provisional ballots. In some States, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked into November 3rd, they were already voted for. So that’s it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win this State and we won the State and we won it very substantially and easily and we’re getting… We have… Much of this is they’re certified, far more certified that we need. But we’re getting additional number certified too. And we’re getting pictures of drop boxes being delivered and delivered late and delivered three days later in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect.

Mark Meadows: (12:50)
So Mr. President, if I, I might be able to jump in and I’ll give Brad a chance, Mr. Secretary, obviously there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted. And that’s at odds with the representation from the secretary of state’s office. What I’m hopeful for is there some way that we can find some kind of an agreement to look at this a little bit more fully. The president mentioned Fulton County, but in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead. And so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise is there’s something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward, that’s less litigious?

Brad Raffensperger: (14:02)
Well, I listened to what the president has just said, President Trump, we’ve had several lawsuits and we’ve had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don’t agree that you have one. I didn’t agree about the 200,000 number that you’d mentioned, and I’ll go through that point by point. What we had done is we gave our State Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue. And then on the State House, the Government Affairs Committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our US congressmen, Republican congressmen. And we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you’ve talked about, you focused in on primarily, I believe it’s the absentee ballot process. I don’t believe that you’re really questioning the Dominion machines because we did a hand re-tally, a 100% re-tally of all the ballots and compare that to what the machine said. And it came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table. I don’t think there’s an issue about that. I think what you [crosstalk 00:15:33].

President Trump: (15:33)
Well, Brad. Not that there’s not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven’t felt we needed to go there. And just to maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we’d like to go further, but we don’t really need to. We have all the votes we need. We won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you.

President Trump: (16:03)
These are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. When you add them up, it’s many more times, it’s many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through … we have not gone through your Dominion, so we can’t give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we’ll have to see. But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have we’re giving you minimal numbers. We’re doing the most conservative numbers possible. We’re many times, many, many times above the margin. Mark, I don’t think we have to go through each-

Mark Meadows: (17:06)
Right, right.

President Trump: (17:06)
Because what’s the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. One of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina, and from other states, and they’re saying it’s impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won … in Alabama we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it’s not possible to have lost Georgia. And I can tell you by our rallies, I can tell you by the rally I’m having on Monday night, the place they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It’s just not possible to have lost Georgia, it’s not possible.

President Trump: (17:54)
When I heard it was close, I said, “There’s no way.” But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night, you know that, Brad. And that’s what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified too. So I just don’t know, Mark, I don’t know what’s the purpose. I won’t give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don’t need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. I mean, having the correct … the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night, along with others that we’re going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even.

President Trump: (18:53)
And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that you’ve recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots, I mean, they’re all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, et cetera. And even if you cut them in half, cut them in half, and cut them in half again, it’s more votes than we need.

Brad Raffensperger: (19:23)
Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen and they were surprised. I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two, two. Two people that were dead that voted and so that’s wrong. That was two.

President Trump: (19:49)
Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? I mean, you tell me.

Cleta Mitchell: (19:54)
Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, and if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died. But we don’t have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary to confirm-

President Trump: (20:48)
[crosstalk 00:20:48] But Cleta, even before you do that and not even including that, that’s why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people so I don’t know. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. But is that we’re so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of Ruby Freeman, known scammer. You know the internet, you know what was trending on the internet? “Where’s Ruby?” Because they thought she’d be in jail. “Where’s Ruby?” It’s crazy, it’s crazy. The minimum number is 18,000 for Ruby, but they think it’s probably about 56,000. But the minimum number is 18,000 on the Ruby Freeman night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let’s face it, Brad, I mean, they did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before.

President Trump: (21:55)
So there’s a term for it when it’s a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing, here’s ballot number, here it is a second time, third time, next ballot. I mean, look, Brad, we have a new tape that we’re going to release, it’s devastating. And by the way, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we’re talking about. That one event was a disaster. But it was something that … it can’t be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven’t seen, but it’s magnified. It’s magnified and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot and I don’t know why three times. Why not five times, right? Yeah, go ahead.

Brad Raffensperger: (22:59)
You’re talking about the State Farm video. And I think it’s extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. So the next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them see the full run of tape. And what you’ll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by-

President Trump: (23:24)
Where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there, there were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there. It was late in the evening, late in the early … in the morning. And there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watches? And why did they say a water main broke, which they did, and which is reported in the newspapers. They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break. And there was no water main, there was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where was the Democrat poll watchers? Because there were none. And then you say, “Well, they left their station.” If you look at the tape and this was reviewed by professional police and detectives, and other people. When they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station.

President Trump: (24:23)
When they came back, they didn’t go to their station. They went to the apron wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those and they went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn’t do even that because that’s illegal, because they had no Republican poll watchers. And remember, her reputation is … she’s known all over the internet, Brad. She’s known all over. I’m telling you, “Where’s Ruby?” was one of the hot items on the … Ruby, they knew her. “Where’s Ruby?” So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was … and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? They put them in three times.

Brad Raffensperger: (25:28)
Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.

President Trump: (25:36)
Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Where were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room? How come we had no security in the room? Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad, and they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes. But they just all happened to run back and go … you know, Brad.

Brad Raffensperger: (26:11)
Mr. President, we’ll send you the link from WSB that does the-

President Trump: (26:14)
I don’t care about a link, I don’t need it. Brad, I have a much better link [crosstalk 00:26:18].

Cleta Mitchell: (26:14)
[crosstalk 00:26:14] Mr. Secretary, I will tell you, I’ve seen the tape, the full tape, so has Alex. We’ve watched it and what we saw, and what we’ve confirmed in the timing, is that they made everybody leave. We have sworn affidavits saying that and then they began to process ballots. And our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. We don’t know that. If you know that-

President Trump: (26:46)
It was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times.

Cleta Mitchell: (26:52)
Well, I don’t know about that but I know-

President Trump: (26:52)
Well, I do because we had ours magnified out [crosstalk 00:26:57].

Cleta Mitchell: (26:55)
I’ve watched the entire tape.

President Trump: (27:01)
But nobody can make a case for that, Brad, nobody. I mean, look, you’d have to be a child to think anything other than that, just a child. I mean, you have you never-Trump [crosstalk 00:27:12] attorney-

Cleta Mitchell: (27:14)
How many ballots, Mr. Secretary, are you saying were processed then?

Brad Raffensperger: (27:22)
We had GPI certainly investigate that.

Ryan Germany: (27:22)
This is Ryan Germany. We had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was there after that event came to light. GBI was with them, as well as F.B.I. agents.

President Trump: (27:34)
Well, there’s no way they could … then they’re incompetent. They’re either dishonest or incompetent, okay [crosstalk 00:27:39].

Cleta Mitchell: (27:40)
Well, what did they find?

President Trump: (27:40)
There’s only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. There’s just no way. Look, there’s no way. And on the other thing I said too, there’s no way that these things could have been … you have all these different people that voted, but they don’t live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too.

Cleta Mitchell: (28:01)
The number who have registered out of state after they moved from Georgia. And so they had a date when they moved from Georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then it’s like 4,500, I don’t have that number right in front of me.

President Trump: (28:15)
And then they came back in and they voted.

Cleta Mitchell: (28:18)
And voted, yeah.

President Trump: (28:19)
I thought that was a large number, though, it was in the 20s. And the point is-

Ryan Germany: (28:24)
We’ve been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they’re not accurate. Every one we’ve been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately. And in many cases-

President Trump: (28:43)
[crosstalk 00:28:43] Really, how may people do that? You mean they moved out, and then they said, “Ah, to hell with it, I’ll move back in.” It doesn’t sound like a very normal … you mean they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? Yeah, it’s crazy.

Ryan Germany: (28:57)
And this is, they moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there’s something about that data that it’s just not accurate.

President Trump: (29:06)
Well, I don’t know, all I know is that it is certified. And they moved out of Georgia and they voted. It didn’t say they moved back in, Cleta, did it?

Cleta Mitchell: (29:16)
No, but I mean, we’re looking at the voter registrat- again, if you have additional records, we’ve been asking for that, but you haven’t shared any of that with us. You just keep saying you’ve investigated [crosstalk 00:29:29] the allegations.

President Trump: (29:29)
But Cleta, a lot of it you don’t need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election. I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There’s no way I lost Georgia. There’s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I’m just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they’re many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes. Now do you think it’s possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that’s what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their machinery. Do you know anything about that? Because that’s illegal.

Ryan Germany: (30:15)
This is Ryan Germany, no, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County [crosstalk 00:30:21] We’re having an election on Tuesday.

President Trump: (30:24)
But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?

Ryan Germany: (30:31)
No.

President Trump: (30:31)
Are you sure, Ryan?

Ryan Germany: (30:34)
I’m sure, I’m sure, Mr. President.

President Trump: (30:39)
What about the ballots, the shredding of the ballots, have they been shredding ballots?

Ryan Germany: (30:44)
The only investigation that we have into that, they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from past elections.

President Trump: (31:00)
Well, I don’t know about that [crosstalk 00:31:02]. It doesn’t pass the smell test though, because we hear they’re shredding thousands and thousands of ballots. And now what they’re saying, “Oh, we’re just cleaning up the office.” I don’t think that-

Brad Raffensperger: (31:16)
Mr. President, the problem that you have with social media, people can say anything.

President Trump: (31:21)
Oh this isn’t social media. This is Trump media. It’s not social media. It’s really not, it’s not social media. I don’t care about social media. I couldn’t care less. Social media is Big Tech. Big Tech is on your side. I don’t even know why you have a side because you should want to have an accurate election. And you’re a Republican.

Brad Raffensperger: (31:42)
We believe that we do have an accurate election.

President Trump: (31:44)
No, no you don’t, no, no you don’t. You don’t have … not even close. You’re off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you’re off on these numbers, and these numbers can’t be just … Well, why won’t … okay, so you sent us into Cobb County for a signature verification-

President Trump: (32:03)
You sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn’t want to go into, and you said it would be open to the public, so we had our experts there. They weren’t allowed into the room. But we didn’t want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County, and you wouldn’t give it to us. Now, why aren’t we doing signature, and why can’t it be open to the public, and why can’t we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don’t want to find anything? You know they don’t want to find anything. Someday you’ll tell me the reason why, because I don’t understand your reasoning, but someday you’ll tell me the reason why. But why don’t you want to find?

Ryan Germany: (32:41)
Mr. President, we chose Cobb County-

President Trump: (32:41)
Why don’t you want to find … What?

Ryan Germany: (32:45)
Sorry, go ahead.

President Trump: (32:47)
Okay, so why did you do Cobb County? We didn’t even request … We requested Fulton County, not Cobb County.

Cleta Mitchell: (32:54)
Well, Mr. President, we do have in our election contest.

Ryan Germany: (32:55)
We chose Cobb County-

Cleta Mitchell: (32:57)
[inaudible 00:32:57].

President Trump: (32:57)
Go ahead, please. Go ahead.

Ryan Germany: (32:59)
We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there’s been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done.

President Trump: (33:07)
No, but I told you, but we’re not saying that.

Cleta Mitchell: (33:10)
We did say that.

President Trump: (33:14)
Fulton County. Look, in my opinion, Stacey is as dishonest as they come. She has outplayed you at everything. She got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. You can’t check signatures. I can’t imagine you’re allowed to do harvesting, I guess, in that agreement. That agreement is a disaster for this country. But she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step. I hate to imagine what’s going to happen on Monday or Tuesday, but it’s very scary to people. When the ballots flow in out of nowhere, it’s very scary to people. That consent decree is a disaster. It’s a disaster. A very good lawyer who examined it said they’ve never seen anything like it.

Brad Raffensperger: (34:12)
Harvesting is still illegal in the state of Georgia, and that settlement agreement did not change that one iota.

President Trump: (34:18)
It’s not a settlement agreement, it’s a consent decree. It even says consent decree on it, doesn’t it? It uses the term consent decree. It doesn’t say settlement agree. It’s a consent decree. It’s a disaster.

Brad Raffensperger: (34:32)
It’s a settlement agreement.

President Trump: (34:35)
What’s written on top of it?

Brad Raffensperger: (34:39)
Ryan?

Ryan Germany: (34:39)
I don’t have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court. It’s not a court order.

President Trump: (34:46)
But Ryan, it’s called a consent decree, is that right? On the paper. Is that right?

Ryan Germany: (34:51)
I don’t believe so, but I don’t have it in front of me.

President Trump: (34:56)
Okay, whatever, it’s a disaster. It’s a disaster. Look, here’s the problem. We can go through signature verification and we’ll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past, but you didn’t do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever recently, and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago or even one, and you’ll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren’t even signed, and you have many that are forgeries, okay? You know that. You know that. You have no doubt about that, and you will be at 11,779 within minutes, because Fulton County is totally corrupt and so is she totally corrupt.

President Trump: (36:05)
And they’re going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad. Whether you know it or not, they’re laughing at you, and you’ve taken a state that’s a Republican state, and you’ve made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody’s ever cheated before. And I don’t care how long it takes me. We’re going to have other states coming forward pretty good, but I won’t … This is never … We have some incredible talent said they’ve never seen anything. Now, the problem is they need more time for the big numbers, but they’re very substantial numbers. But I think you’re going to find that …

President Trump: (36:50)
By the way, a little information. I think you’re going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots, because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they’re brand new and they don’t have a seal and there’s the whole thing with the ballots, but the ballots are corrupt, and you are going to find that they are, which is totally illegal. It’s more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know what they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s a criminal offense, and you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I’ve heard, and they are removing machinery, and they’re moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds, and you can’t let it happen and you are letting it happen. I mean, I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen.

President Trump: (37:48)
So look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state, and flipping the state is a great testament to our country because it’s a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it, if it was a mistake. I don’t know. A lot of people think it wasn’t a mistake. It was much more criminal than that, but it’s a big problem in Georgia and it’s not a problem that’s going away. I mean, it’s not a problem that’s going away.

Ryan Germany: (38:29)
Mr. President, this is Ryan. We’re looking into every one of those things that you mentioned. All investigators [crosstalk 00:38:36].

President Trump: (38:36)
Good, but if you find it you’ve got to say it, Ryan.

Ryan Germany: (38:41)
And they are.

President Trump: (38:42)
Let me ask you. Ryan, if they’re destroying ballots-

Ryan Germany: (38:42)
Let me tell you what we are seeing.

President Trump: (38:44)
Go ahead.

Ryan Germany: (38:45)
What we’re seeing is not at all what you’re describing. These are investigators from our office, these are investigators from GBI, and they’re looking and they’re good, and that’s not what they’re seeing. And we’ll keep looking. We’ll keep looking at all these things. What we are seeing-

President Trump: (39:04)
Well, you better check the ballots because they are shredding ballots, Ryan. I’m just telling you, Ryan. They’re shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully, because that’s so illegal. You may not even believe it because it’s so bad, but they’re shredding ballots because they think we’re going to eventually get there. Because we’ll eventually get into Fulton. In my opinion, it’s never too late. So a little double sound there. So, that’s the story fellas. Look, we need only 11,000 votes. We have are far more than that as it stands now. We’ll have more and more. Do you have provisional ballots at all, Brad? Provisional ballots?

Brad Raffensperger: (39:59)
Provisional ballots are allowed by state law.

President Trump: (40:02)
Sure, but I mean, are they counted or did you just hold them back because? In other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?

Brad Raffensperger: (40:13)
We’ll get you that number.

President Trump: (40:14)
Because most of them are made out to the name, Trump, because these are people that were scammed when they came in, and we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were probably going to vote on November 3rd, and they were told, “I’m sorry, you’ve already been voted for. You’ve already voted.” The women, men started screaming, “No, I proudly voted til November 3rd.” They said, “I’m sorry, but you’ve already been voted for, and you have a ballot,” and these people are beside themselves, so they went out and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it.

President Trump: (40:55)
And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100% Trump. I mean, 100% Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in. I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100% for Biden, even though Trump won the military by a lot, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100% for Biden. Do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it?

Cleta Mitchell: (41:33)
I know about, but we were never-

Ryan Germany: (41:36)
[inaudible 00:41:36].

President Trump: (41:36)
Okay, Cleta. I’m not asking you Cleta, honestly. I’m asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now? Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100% for Biden. Do you know about that?

Ryan Germany: (41:56)
I don’t know about that. I do know that we have when military ballots come in, it’s not just military. It’s also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat.

President Trump: (42:15)
No, but this was-

Ryan Germany: (42:15)
This was a mix of them.

President Trump: (42:17)
That’s okay. But I got like 78% of the military. These ballots were all for … They didn’t tell me overseas. Could be overseas too, but I get votes overseas too, Ryan, in all fairness. No, they came in. A large batch came in and it was, quote, 100% for Biden, and that is criminal. That’s criminal, okay? That’s another criminal. That’s another of the many criminal events. Many criminal events here. I don’t know. Look, Brad, I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot, and therefore, I won the state. That’s before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. And I watched you this morning and you said, “Well, there was no criminality,” but all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it’s very dangerous for you to say that.

President Trump: (43:19)
I just don’t know why you don’t want to have the votes counted as they are. Like, even you, when you went and did that check, and I was surprised because, I didn’t [inaudible 00:43:30] the check, and we found a few thousand votes that were against me. I was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you’re doing is re-certifying existing votes. You were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. That was sort of surprising. That came down. Three or five. I don’t know, still a lot of votes. But you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures, and if you check with Fulton County, you’ll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into Fulton County and the other county next to it.

President Trump: (44:10)
So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. We have that in spades already, or we can keep it going, but that’s not fair to the voters of Georgia because they’re going to see what happened, and they’re going to see what happened. I mean, I’ll take on to anybody you want with regard to Ruby Freeman and her lovely daughter. A very lovely young lady, I’m sure. But Ruby Freeman, I will take Freeman. I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots but they used them three times, so that’s a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way. That’s the other thing we didn’t say.

President Trump: (44:57)
The Ruby Freeman thing, the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important, do you know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad? Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan?

Ryan Germany: (45:22)
That’s not accurate, Mr. President.

President Trump: (45:24)
Huh. What is accurate?

Ryan Germany: (45:28)
The numbers that we are showing are accurate.

President Trump: (45:33)
No, about Ruby Freeman, about early in the morning, Ryan. When the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? Do you know who those ballots … Do who they were made out to? Do you know who they were voting for?

Ryan Germany: (45:52)
No, not specifically.

President Trump: (45:54)
Did you ever check?

Ryan Germany: (45:59)
We did what I described to you earlier.

President Trump: (46:02)
No, no, no. Did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by Ruby Freeman, a known political operative and balloteer. Did ever check who those votes were for?

Ryan Germany: (46:16)
We looked into that situation that you described.

President Trump: (46:19)
No, they were 100% for Biden. 100%. There wasn’t a Trump vote in the whole group. Why don’t you want to find this, Ryan? What’s wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I’m sure you’re a good lawyer. You have a nice last name. But I’m just curious, why do you keep fighting this thing? It just doesn’t make sense. We’re way over the 17,779, right? We’re way over that number, and just if you took just Ruby Freeman, we’re over that number by five or six times when you multiply that times three, and every single ballot went to Biden. And you didn’t know that, but now you know it.

President Trump: (47:16)
So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it’s not fair to take it away from us like this, and it’s going to be very costly in many ways, and I think you have to say that you’re going to reexamine it and you can reexamine it. But reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don’t want to find answers. For instance, I’m hearing, Ryan, and he’s probably I’m sure a great lawyer and everything, but he’s making statements about those ballots that he doesn’t know. But he’s making them with such … He did make them with surety, but now I think he’s less sure, because the answer is they all went to Biden. That alone wins us the election by a lot.

President Trump: (48:03)
And that alone wins us the election by a lot. You know?

Brad Raffensperger: (48:07)
Mr. President, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information and then it comes before the court. And the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.

President Trump: (48:23)
Why do you say that though? I don’t know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts. But why do you say that? First of all, they don’t even assign us a judge. They don’t even assign us a judge. But why wouldn’t you… Hey Brad, why wouldn’t you want to check out Ruby Freeman? And why wouldn’t you want to say, “Hey, if in fact President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia”? Just that one incident alone, without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say you stick by… I mean, I’ve been watching you for… You don’t care about anything. Your numbers are right. But your numbers aren’t right. They’re really wrong, and they’re really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than ultimately… Look, ultimately, I win. Okay? Because-

Cleta Mitchell: (49:18)
But Mr. Secretary, Mr. President-

President Trump: (49:18)
You guys are so wrong and you’ve created the population of Georgia so badly between you and your governor who was down at 21… He was down 21 points and like a schmuck, I endorsed him and he got elected. But I will tell you, he’s a disaster. I can’t imagine… The people are so angry in Georgia. I can’t imagine he’s ever getting elected again. I’ll tell you that much right now. But why wouldn’t you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? Because those numbers are so wrong. [crosstalk 00:50:00].

Cleta Mitchell: (49:59)
Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, one of the things that we have been… Alex can talk about this. We talked about it. And I don’t know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but I think what the president is saying, what we’ve been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven’t even assigned a judge, but the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. You have data and records that we don’t have access to, and you keep telling us and making public statements that you’ve investigated this and nothing to see here. But we don’t know about that. All we know is what you tell us. What I don’t understand is why wouldn’t it be in everyone’s best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers.

Cleta Mitchell: (50:56)
But to try to be able to get to the truth because we don’t have any way of confirming what you’re telling us. You tell us that you’ve had an investigation at the State Farm Arena. I don’t have any report. I’ve never seen a report of investigation. I don’t know what that is. I’ve been pretty involved in this. I don’t know. That’s just one of 25 categories and it doesn’t even… As the president said, we haven’t even gotten into the Dominion issue. That’s not part of our case. It’s not part of… We just didn’t feel as though we had any way to be able to develop [crosstalk 00:03:42]-

President Trump: (51:40)
No, we do have a way, but I don’t want to get into it-

Cleta Mitchell: (51:43)
Exactly.

President Trump: (51:43)
Because we found a way in other states, Cleta. Excuse me.

Cleta Mitchell: (51:46)
Right.

President Trump: (51:47)
But we don’t need it because we’re only down 11,000 votes. So we don’t even need it.

Cleta Mitchell: (51:52)
Right. All I’m saying [crosstalk 00:51:53]-

President Trump: (51:52)
I personally think they’re corrupt as hell, but we don’t need that-

Cleta Mitchell: (51:56)
[crosstalk 00:51:57]-

President Trump: (51:57)
Because all we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000 plus votes. So we don’t need that. I’m not looking to shake up the whole world. We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic simple numbers, we want it easily. Easily. We’re not giving Dominion a pass, on the record. I will say that.

Cleta Mitchell: (52:20)
No. Right. Exactly.

President Trump: (52:22)
We don’t need Dominion because we have so many other votes that we don’t need to prove it anymore than we already have.

Kurt Hilbert: (52:30)
Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert. If I might interject here for a moment. Ryan, I would like to suggest that to just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 folks that were counted illegally. That in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or replace the outcome in doubt. We would like to just sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and settlement just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. If you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. However, we believe that they are accurate. We’ve had now three to four separate experts look at these numbers. These numbers are based upon the USPS-

President Trump: (53:19)
And certified accountants looked at them.

Kurt Hilbert: (53:22)
Correct. And this is just based on USPS data and your own Secretary of State data. So that’s what we would [inaudible 00:53:30] and ask you to do to sit down with us in a compromise and settlement proceeding and actually go through the registered voter IDs and the registrations. If you can convince us that that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. But we tend to believe that that is obviously more than 11,779 that’s sufficient to change the result entirely in and of itself. What would you say to that, Mr. Germany?

Ryan Germany: (54:03)
Kurt, I’m happy to… I’ll get with our lawyers and we’ll set that up. But that number is not accurate, and I think we can show you for all the ones we’ve looked at why it’s not. So if that would be helpful, I’m happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys.

President Trump: (54:22)
Well, let me ask you, Kurt. Kurt, you think that is an accurate number. That was based on the information given to you by the Secretary of State’s department, right?

Kurt Hilbert: (54:31)
That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the Secretary of State’s office data. That has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the Secretary of State. Yet, we have asked for it six times. I’ve sent a letter over to Mr. [inaudible 00:54:50] several times requesting this information, and it’s been rebuffed every single time. It stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there’s something to hide. That’s the problem that we have.

Ryan Germany: (55:04)
Well, that’s not the case. There are things that you guys are entitled to get and there’s things that under law, we are not allowed to give out.

President Trump: (55:11)
Well, you have to… Well, under law you’re not allowed to give faulty election results. Okay? You’re not allowed to do that. And that’s what you’ve done. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up. Because of what you’ve done to the president… The people of Georgia know that this was a scam. Because of what you’ve done to the president, a lot of people aren’t going out to vote, and a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it, and they’re going to vote. And you would be respected, really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And therefore, I think that it really is important that you have meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers.

President Trump: (56:01)
Because I know, Brad, if you think we’re right, I think you’re going to say… And I’m not looking to blame anybody. I’m not blaming. I’m just saying that under new counts and under new views of the election results, we won the election. It’s very simple. We won the election. As the governor of major states and the surrounding states, there’s no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody, everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I’ll tell you it’s going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don’t get this thing straightened out fast.

Mark Meadows: (56:45)
Mr. President, this is Mark. Let me just… It sounds like we’ve got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas. I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the Secretary of State’s data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct?

Ryan Germany: (57:15)
That’s not what I said. I’m happy to sit down or have our lawyer sit down with Kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, “Hey, based on what we’ve looked at so far, here’s how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong.” [crosstalk 00:57:32]

Mark Meadows: (57:32)
What you’re saying, Ryan… Hold on. Let me make sure. So what you’re saying is you really don’t want to give access to the data. You just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?

Ryan Germany: (57:44)
I don’t think we can give access to data that’s protected by law. But we can sit down with them and say, “Hey, we’re looking [crosstalk 00:57:52]-”

President Trump: (57:51)
But you’re allowed to have a phony election? You’re allowed to have a phony election, right?

Ryan Germany: (57:56)
No, sir.

President Trump: (57:58)
When are you going to do the signature counts on… When are you going to do signature verification on Fulton County? Which you said you were going to do and now all of a sudden you’re not doing it. When are you doing that?

Ryan Germany: (58:10)
We are going to do that. We’ve announced it.

Kurt Hilbert: (58:12)
To get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the Secretary of State could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that private information without you having any kind of violation?

President Trump: (58:29)
Well, I don’t want to know who it is. You guys can do it very confidentially. You can sign a confidentiality agreement. That’s okay. I don’t need to know names.

Mark Meadows: (58:38)
All right. Let me-

President Trump: (58:39)
But we got the information on this stuff that we’re talking about. We got all that information from the Secretary of State.

Mark Meadows: (58:48)
Yeah. So let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together when we get off of this phone call. If you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we’ve got with your attorneys where we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, you said there was only two dead people that would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. That may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there were more than that. But at the same time, I think it’s important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that’s the good next step, hopefully we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.

President Trump: (59:43)
Well, why don’t my lawyers show you where you got the information? It’ll show the Secretary of State. And you don’t even have to look at any names. We don’t want names. We don’t care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about… She’s going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she’s done to this party is unbelievable. I tell you. And I only ran against her once, and that was with a guy named Brian Kemp. And I beat her. If I didn’t run, Brian wouldn’t have had even a shot either in the general or the primary. He was dead. Dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was, but that’s the way it is. That’s the way it is.

President Trump: (01:00:29)
I would like you to… For the attorneys [inaudible 00:12:31], I’d like you to perhaps meet with Ryan ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you’re going to have people just not voting. They don’t want to vote. They hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the Secretary of State. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you. They like you. They can’t believe what they found. They want more people like you.

President Trump: (01:01:04)
Look, can you get together tomorrow? Brad, we just want the truth. It’s simple. And everyone’s going to look very good if the truth comes out. It’s okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. The real truth is I won by 400,000 votes at least. That’s the real truth, but we don’t need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. Are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan?

Ryan Germany: (01:01:38)
I’ll get with Chris, the lawyer who’s representing us in the case and see when he can get together with Kurt.

Kurt Hilbert: (01:01:45)
All right.

Brad Raffensperger: (01:01:46)
Ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call. Mr. Meadows. Thank you, President Trump, for your time.

President Trump: (01:01:53)
Okay. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

Mark Meadows: (01:01:58)
Thank you.

Cleta Mitchell: (01:01:58)
Thank you.

President Trump: (01:01:58)
Thank you very much. Bye.
