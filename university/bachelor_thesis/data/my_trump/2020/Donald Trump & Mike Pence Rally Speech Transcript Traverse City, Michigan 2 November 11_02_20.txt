Mike Pence: (00:00)
That’s what I’m talking about. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. He’s going to be here in about 40 minutes. But would you all join me in just thanking a few people. First and foremost, she’s a Marine Corps mom, she’s been a champion for military families, she’s a school teacher at a little Christian schools, she’s been my wife for 35 years. Would you join me in thanking the greatest second lady of the United States that we’ve ever had? My wife, Karen Pence. Thank you. But Karen and I are here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Michigan and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.

Mike Pence: (01:06)
It’s on Michigan. And the road to victory goes right through the Great Lakes state. We need the people of this freedom loving state to do just what you did in 2016. By tomorrow night, we need Michigan to show America that this is Trump country. But it really is great to be with y’all. It really is great. Also it’s great to be here with some good friends of mine under the President. In fact, one of whom is the highest ranking combat veteran ever to serve in the Congress of the United States. Now, he’s one of the strongest voices for our national defense. Join me in thanking Congressman Jack Bergman, will you? Thank you, Jack. It’s also great to be here with a man who has served the people of Michigan in the State House. And I’ve served alongside him, and I can tell you, he is one of the strongest allies of our President and our agenda in the United States Congress, Congressman John Moolenaar.

Mike Pence: (02:19)
And let me say what a privilege it is to be here with a man that I got to know over the last couple of years. He’s a man of integrity, he’s a family man, a West Point graduate, a combat veteran, a businessman, and the next senator from the great state of Michigan, John James. Well, thank you all for being here. I know you’re out today to hear and see our President, show your support, but I also know you’re here, because of all that we accomplished together over the last four years. I mean, think about it, four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise and we witnessed a steady assault on our values.

Mike Pence: (03:16)
But in three short years, we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy, we secured our border supported law enforcement and stood for life, liberty, and the Constitution of the United States. After Joe Biden spent the previous eight years trying to tax, and spend, and bail our way back to a growing economy, President Donald Trump created the greatest economy in American history. And we’re doing it again, Michigan! I mean, how about those new GDP numbers last week? Did you check that out? 33% growth in the third quarter. Shattered any previous record. The great American comeback is on. And with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, we’re going to bring this economy back bigger and better than ever before!

Mike Pence: (04:28)
The President said it was the biggest quarter in the history of our country, not even close. And he and I both know this American comeback is a testament to all of you, to the resilience, and the strength, and the character of the American people. But it’s also a tribute to a president and our allies in Congress who created the greatest economy the world has ever seen. That’s why it’s remarkable to think, in the midst of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars. His running mate, Kamala Harris said on Friday that their “first order of business would be to get rid of President Trump’s tax cuts.” They got a two trillion dollar Green New Deal. They want to put socialized medicine in the heart of Obamacare, risk the health insurance of 180 million Americans.

Mike Pence: (05:29)
But under President Donald Trump, in three short years, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade, unleashed American energy, and businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs, including 112,000 jobs right here in Michigan. It’s true. When Joe Biden was vice president, America actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. It’s amazing. I come from south of here in Indiana, and just like Michigan, we do two things well around here. We make things and we grow things. We’re proud of it. But the last president, who I heard is out campaigning today, four years ago, he said those jobs were never coming back. He actually said, “What magic wand do you have?” Well, we didn’t need a magic wand.

Mike Pence: (06:39)
We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years. And when it comes to trade, so important to what we make and what we grow. And Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. And he never lifted a finger to reform a trade deal with Mexico and Canada, that literally costs thousands of factories to close across this country. But under President Trump, we put China on notice. We imposed tariffs and made it clear the era of economic surrender is over and NAFTA is gone, and the USMCA is here to stay. Now, Joe Biden’s running mate, I actually I had a debate with her in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago. Some people think we did all right. So, thank you. But I brought this up in the debate, because you deserve to know Kamala Harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA.

Mike Pence: (08:03)
She said it didn’t go far enough on climate change. I Kamala Harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Michigan jobs and Michigan workers. And I’ll make you a promise in four more years, President Trump will always put American jobs and American workers first. And I’ll tell you, it’s just as clear on energy. I mean, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to crush the American economy under a two trillion dollar version of the Green New Deal. Remember first debate, the President had to remind Joe Biden that he supported the Green New Deal. He does. I mean the Green New Deal, I’m telling you, it would actually raise cost of electricity in your home and raise the cost of electricity in every business in Michigan. President Trump, he’s been a champion for American energy.

Mike Pence: (09:07)
We ended the war on coal. We’ve opened up our natural resources and we’re now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. It’s true. But worse still, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over the last year said over and over again that they want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking. I mean, that would cost hundreds of thousands of direct jobs across the heartland. They said it over and over again. And then Joe Biden shows up in Pittsburgh, I wasn’t far from there today, a couple of weeks back. And he’s trying to convince people in Pennsylvania that he’s not for banning fracking. He actually said our President was lying about his record, remember? Even in that presidential debate and… How good did President Trump do in that presidential debate, am I right? Out of the park. Still going, right? Well, in that presidential debate, you saw the moment, where Joe Biden said that we needed to “transition from the oil industry.”

Mike Pence: (10:22)
President Trump said, “That’s a big statement.” And then when the President called him on it, he said, “Show the tape.” So, we’ve been showing the tape. And I bet when the President gets here, he’s going to show you the tape again. Men and women of Michigan, no matter what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are saying right now, you can take it to the bank. Joe Biden and the democratic party are going to try and abolish fossil fuels, close down the oil industry, ban fracking, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to have more fracking, more American energy, more energy independence for this generation and for generations to come when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years!

Mike Pence: (11:24)
I mean, honestly, here’s the choice America faces. It’s a choice between a Trump boom and a Biden depression. I mean, a study just came out, non-partisan study that said Joe Biden’s economic policies would cost five million American jobs. And it would reduce the average income of American families by $6,500 a year. So, when you go home tonight, if you run into anybody tonight or any time on election day who hasn’t made a decision yet in Michigan, here’s what you got to ask them. Seriously. Just look at them and say, “Who do you really think can bring this economy all the way back? I mean, a career politician who’s spent 47 years raising taxes, stifling the economy with regulation and economic surrender, or a proven job creator who’s overseeing the fastest economic recovery in history to bring America all the way back?” We need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.

Mike Pence: (12:42)
So, it’s about our economy, but we all know that security is the foundation of our prosperity, and I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. You might not know we got some service members in our immediate family. My son’s a United States Marine. And my unworthy son-in-law is a United States Navy pilot currently deployed with the United States Navy. They couldn’t be with us tonight, but I couldn’t be more proud that that Navy spouse, my wonderful daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond is traveling with her mom and dad today. Would you say hi to her? So, proud of them.

Mike Pence: (13:37)
But you deserve to know when Joe Biden was vice president, we went through years of reckless budget cuts, didn’t we, John? I mean, they hollowed out our military readiness. And over the last few days I read where Democrats in Washington are already saying that they’re planning, they’re planning massive cuts to our national defense to pay for their big government program. President Trump, we rebuild our military. This president signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And with four more years, we’re going to keep giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and coast guard the resources and the support they need to defend our nation. And it’s not just been about those who serve in uniform, it’s been about those of you who did serve. When Joe Biden was vice president, we remember the scandals at the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation, don’t we?

Mike Pence: (14:36)
I mean, we had veterans that were literally dying, waiting for care at the VA on waiting lists. But when President Trump came into the oval office, those days are over. Our president signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired 3,000 VA employees who weren’t giving our veterans the care they deserve. The VA now has a 91% approval rating. And Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. And for our national defense to support our veterans for peace through strength, it’s just one more reason why we need a combat veteran in the United States Senate. We need John James in the Senate from the great state of Michigan. And when it comes to law and order, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement every single day. I mean, you all know what the President and I know, the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement in this country are some of the best people in America and they deserve the respect of every American every day.

Mike Pence: (16:09)
After the summer of violence that we’ve seen, after the rioting and looting that we saw in Philadelphia this week, the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that are leading to violence in our cities. Now, Joe Biden says that America is, in his words, systemically racist. He says that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. When Joe Biden was asked whether he’d cut funding for law enforcement, he replied, “Yes, absolutely.” And his running mate, Kamala Harris recently praised the LA mayor for cutting $150 million out of the LAPD’s budget. Under President Donald Trump, I’ll make you a promise. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. We’re going to back the blue and we’re going to back the blue for four more years.

Mike Pence: (17:21)
The President and I know we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors, and families, and other minorities in our cities. We’ve done both for the last three-and-a-half years, and we’re going to keep doing both. We’re going to support law enforcement with more resources and more training. And we’re going to keep creating jobs, and opportunity, and educational choice options for African-Americans and all the families that live in our major cities. And we’re going to have law and order for every American of every race, and creed, and color so help us, God. And all along the way under this President’s leadership, we’ve stood for all the liberties and freedoms enshrined in our founding documents, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech. And President Donald Trump has stood strong for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We’ve appointed more than 220 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level. And I promise you, they’re all conservatives who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and just like Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Mike Pence: (18:54)
Isn’t she great? Isn’t she great? How much did you like that when they asked her what she had on that piece of paper in front of her? Nothing. She’s going to be an amazing jurors for generations to come, and she’s going to make America proud. But y’all deserve to know when Joe Biden was vice-president, we saw a steady assault on our religious freedom. We did. They used the power of the bureaucratic state to erode the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. They even hauled a group of Catholic nuns into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. It’s true. When Judge Amy Coney Barrett was up for a different court two years ago, that same religious intolerance among the Democrats in Washington came out. The leading Democrat on the judiciary committee said she was concerned about Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith, because she said, and I quote, “the dogma lives loudly within you.” And Hollywood elites started attacking Judge Barrett and they’ve never stopped. Well, I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood… False alarm.

Mike Pence: (20:32)
I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood, that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you, and the right to live, and work, and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America! And under President Donald Trump, we’ve stood for that first freedom, religious freedom strong. We restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. And it was President Donald Trump who ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Supreme Court made it permanent. And finally, where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. So, in our first three years, we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy.

Mike Pence: (21:47)
We stood for law and order, liberties, and life. None of that would have been possible without the strong support of Michigan’s Republicans in Congress. So, right after you reelect President Donald Trump, right after you send John James to the United States Senate, we all need Michigan to send Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Moolenaar to a new Republican majority and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all. Out. I’m telling you. Out. When you look at what we were able to accomplish all of us with the support of the people of Michigan, that historic election four years ago, I think there’s only one way you can describe it. In three short years, we made America great again. And then 2020 arrived as President Trump led our nation through the worst global pandemic in the century. And all along the way, President Donald Trump put the health of America first. It’s true.

Mike Pence: (23:24)
Before the first documented case of community spread, President Trump did what no American president had ever done in history. He closed off all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden at the time said that was xenophobic, which is I guess a fancy word for racist. He said closing off travel during a global pandemic would actually “make things worse.” But Joe Biden got it wrong and President Donald Trump got it right. I can tell you, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force these last eight months, President Trump’s action shutting off travel to China saved untold American lives, because it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. It’s true.

Mike Pence: (24:24)
We reinvented testing. We saw to the manufacturing production, including here in Michigan, billions of supplies of medical equipment and PPE. We developed therapeutics that are saving lives. And we are literally a short time away from having the first safe Coronavirus vaccine and tens of millions of doses for the American people. And I promise you, people in Michigan can be confident. We’re going to keep making sure those supplies are available to our great doctors and nurses. We’re going to keep protecting the vulnerable. We’re going to keep saving lives and distribute a vaccine. And we are opening up America again. It’s amazing to think in the last five months on that foundation we poured and with the unprecedented relief for families and businesses the President secured from Congress, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 11-and-a-half million people go back to work, including 600,000 people right here in Michigan! We’re opening up America and Michigan is roaring back.

Mike Pence: (25:41)
But you all deserve to know, Joe Biden is talking about shutting down our economy again. It’s true. If you saw the newspapers the last couple of days, several European countries are already talking about shutting down. So, you can bet that Joe Biden will lockdown the American economy if he makes it to the White House. All the schools will be closed, all your churches, synagogues, places of worship. Businesses will all be shuttered again. Right at the moment that the American economy is getting back on its feet, Joe Biden said this summer he would shut it down. Well, Joe Biden says we’re in for a long dark winter, but under President Donald Trump, we’re going to defeat the virus and the best is yet to come. The choice in this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. When you look at their agenda: higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, Green New Deal, defunding the police, abortion on demand. It’s clear.

Mike Pence: (26:54)
And Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. I don’t know if you’ve seen it in the news, but Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are already angling for cabinet posts. Joe Biden said that democracy is on the ballot tomorrow. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. I think law and order are on the ballot. But I also think there are things far more foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. Men and women in Michigan, in this election, I think it’s not going to be so much whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue. The choice in this election is whether America remains America.

Mike Pence: (27:54)
Whether we’re going to chart a future with President Donald Trump, build on our American heritage of faith, and family, and patriotism, and freedom, or whether we’re going to let Joe Biden and the democratic parties surrender our country to the radical left, shut down our economy, topple our heritage, and our values, and our freedom in an avalanche of socialism in decline. So, let me say from my heart to all of my friends here in Michigan, for all the ideals and values that have always made this country unique and exceptional, for our very freedom bequeathed to us by generations of Americans, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve gotten to know this president over the last four years. Some people think we’re a little bit different, but actually we’ve gotten to be very close friends.

Mike Pence: (29:23)
We spend time together every day or we speak every day, and I can tell you, President Donald Trump is the real deal. He’s a man who says what he means and means what he says. He never quits, he never backs down, and he has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the American people. Now, it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s our turn to fight for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House! Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops. And it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.

Mike Pence: (30:21)
So, before he gets here, I got a couple of things to ask you to do. Number one, before the polls close tomorrow, we need you to vote Michigan, vote to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years! The time for speeches is almost over, the time for voting is coming up. Tomorrow morning, I’m told the polls open 7:00 AM open till 8:00 PM here in Michigan. And remember friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a co- worker, and vote to reelect President Donald Trump to the White House. And secondly, after you vote with a friend, I need you to go find somebody to talk to about this election. I mean, Michigan always plays an outsized role in presidential politics, and that’ll be especially true this year. And the choice that Michigan makes is literally going to be a choice that sets our nation on one path or another for generations to come.

Mike Pence: (31:38)
So, you just need to tell them about the stakes in this election. Tell them about the progress we made, the way this president has led us through this challenging year, the way we rebuilt our military and revived our economy, the way America is coming back, and tell them about the choice, and tell them why. The President and I were on a news show a week ago Sunday, 60 Minutes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. But there was a great moment. So, the President got asked a question. His answer, I’ll just never forget. The reporter looks at him and she says, thinking about all of you, she said, “So, how would you describe your supporters?” And without hesitation, the President answered the question. She said, “How would you describe your supporters?” And he said, “They are people who love our country.” So, go find a neighbor, tell them you love America, and tell them we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House!

Speaker 1: (33:00)
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.

Mike Pence: (33:00)
And then finally, I just encourage you in all that remains in between now and when the polls close just to have faith. Have faith in America when you speak to your neighbors and friends. I think you study American history. Every time the American people are given a clear choice between a future of more freedom and less freedom, they choose freedom every time. Have faith in the boundless capacity of the American people to overcome any challenge. And finally, have faith that he who planted this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores will see us through these challenging times to bring us through stronger and better than ever before. There’s a verse that’s been over the mantle of our home for 20 years since we first stepped forward to serve in public life. And they’re ancient words that Americans have long clung to and our little family does. They simply say for I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future. Have faith and pray for America.

Mike Pence: (34:27)
And I just know if all of us do all we need to do between now and when the polls close at eight o’clock here in Michigan tomorrow with your continued support and your prayers, we’re going to have a great victory all across Michigan and all across America. And with Congressmen Jack Bergman and Congressman John Moolenaar in that new Republican majority in the House, with John James in a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate, with President Donald Trump back in the White House for four more years, and with God’s help, we’re going to make Michigan and America more prosperous than ever before. We’re going to make Michigan and America safer than ever before. We’re going to make Michigan and America more united than ever before. And with your support together, we will make America great again again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless America. Now let’s go get it done, Michigan. (singing).

Speaker 2: (51:32)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. (singing).

President Trump: (52:01)
Oh thank you. Oh wow. This is a big crowd. We have a lot of big crowds, but this is a big crowd. This is great. Thank you very much. Hello, Traverse City and hello Michigan. We want the same result as we had four years ago from Michigan, right. And we fulfilled all our promises. You have auto plants. So many, you didn’t have one in 42 years, and now you have 17 and going up and they’re going so fast. I don’t know. Nobody’s complaining. I can tell you that, but we want that same result. We’re going to get out and vote because tomorrow we are going to win this state and we are going to win more years in the White House.

President Trump: (54:57)
And I want to thank you to our great Vice President Mike Pence. He works so hard. I will take him over Kamala every day of the week. We will take Mike. He’s great. He’s great. He’s done a great job. He works very hard and he had a good debate. Didn’t he have a good debate against Kamala from a different world? With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect our 2nd Amendment, defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful term made in the USA, right. Made in the USA.

President Trump: (55:45)
Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You had a great year last year, the year before, the year before, three great years, the best you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have the best year you ever had next year. We’re all set. You saw what happened. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever, ever, ever recorded, 33.1%. You saw that on Friday. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That’s a record, while foreign nations are in a free fall, sadly in a free fall. And you look at what’s happening with Europe and other places. Very sad. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. You look at our numbers, look at the auto numbers. Look at what’s happening with that business and so many other businesses in this country, but that business because we happen to be in a place that likes automobiles, right.

President Trump: (56:47)
A recent Gallup Poll just came out, found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. And that’s during a pandemic and we’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner and you got to open your states. You got to open your state, open it, open it up Governor. Open it up Governor. Open it up Governor. Got to open it up. If Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. They want to raise taxes at a level that nobody’s ever heard of before. Biden will raise your taxes over $4 trillion. It’s not him. Do you think it’s him? He doesn’t have a clue. He has no clue, but that’s okay. Let’s assume he does. We have to win. So that’s sad. Can’t do that to our country. Our country has too much unbelievable potential actually. Massively increasing your regulations, shutting down your economy. They’re going to close down your factory, send your jobs overseas to China and other places.

President Trump: (58:10)
I don’t think so. Destroy the suburbs. Are you happy in the suburbs that I ended the regulation that was going to destroy the suburbs, that has been destroyed the suburbs? The women of the suburbs, they love me I think, but the fake news says they don’t, but I think they do. They love their home. They love their house. They don’t want a development put next to the house. They want their house the way it is. They want to have their beautiful house and they want to have security and they want to have safety. I think they like Trump. I really do. That happened the last time. That happened four years ago. Remember they said, “Women will not vote for Donald Trump at that time. Women will not.” And then at the end of the evening where they were all crying, they say, “Women, what happened?” The women came out, right. The women like us. That’s nice.

President Trump: (59:19)
Well, I like the women. I will tell you, I think the women are great. You notice we don’t even talk about the men with suburbia. We let you guys be alone. They want to dissolve your borders, maybe rip down the wall. They were talking about that. Let’s take down the wall. We have our strongest border right now and the wall is almost complete. Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, but it’s almost complete. Terminate religious liberty, outlaw private care, 180 million people they want to take it away, go to socialized medicine. I don’t think so. You’ve worked hard for that. You have some of the greatest healthcare in the world. You’ve worked hard for it. They want to take it away. 180 million private plans, take it away. Now, if you feel a little bad or if you want to check up, you go to a hospital, you wait in line for about six weeks, and you get yourself checked out. They say you have a problem. They can’t do anything about it. That’s called socialized medicine.

President Trump: (01:00:18)
Confiscate your guns, 2nd Amendment, and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. And just a little while ago on the beautiful Air Force One. How does it look? Let me see. Oh, you don’t see it. By the way, how about the sky? Oh, so beautiful. Let’s just look at the sky for a little while. I wish we had time, right. I wish we had time. So I’ve made five today. Five of these, all with love, all with big crowds, all with love. It’s incredible. Somebody said I actually do six today because we finished up last night in Miami at 1:30 in the morning so.

Speaker 1: (01:01:11)
We love you.

President Trump: (01:01:11)
Thank you.

Speaker 1: (01:01:11)
We love you.

President Trump: (01:01:11)
Oh, thank you very much.

Speaker 1: (01:01:11)
We love you. We love you.

President Trump: (01:01:13)
Thank you.

Speaker 1: (01:01:13)
We love you. We love you. We love you.

President Trump: (01:01:13)
That’s very nice, thank you.

Speaker 1: (01:01:13)
We love you.

President Trump: (01:01:23)
Don’t make me cry. Don’t make me cry. If I started to cry, they’d have a big story. They’d say, ” The president broke down and cried.” And I don’t know if that’s good for us. Probably could, maybe it brings me up four or five points, I promise. I don’t care, but that’s really nice. It’s never been said before. They say there’s never been. We’ve liked Ronald Reagan we’ve liked a lot, but they say that’s the love. We love you. Think of it. When you think about it, right. It’s an incredible thing. We’ve worked hard. We’ve gotten you everything we said. We’ve done the things we said. We’ve done the things we said. We get you the biggest tax cut in history. The biggest regulation cut in history.

President Trump: (01:02:08)
We’ve rebuilt our military. Our vets just gave us a 91% approval rating on what we’ve done for them. We’ve got your Space Force and you’ll be making a lot of this stuff right here in Michigan. Space Force, that is the first time in 74 years since Air Force. Think of that, right. A whole new force. I just signed an executive order on Air Force One to teach our students pro American values. It’s a good thing with all the things that I’ve been watching that have been taking place over a pretty long period of time. Pretty long period of time, even before Obama and Sleepy Joe. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and to ban fracking.

President Trump: (01:02:59)
Look, he said it. He said it. He campaigned for over a year. We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking. Then he goes to Pennsylvania and they say well, his people told him. He didn’t have any idea what they meant, but it was okay. He listened. So they said, “Listen, you have to be in favor of fracking now.” They said, “Okay, no problem. Why? I only said it about 200 times during debates, right.” So now he goes into Pennsylvania where we just left. Great people by the way. You talk about that was an unbelievably enthusiastic group of people. We’re going to win Pennsylvania. We’re going to win. We’re going to win Michigan too. We’re going to win Pennsylvania. We won Pennsylvania last time too. We won this one. We won. This one hadn’t been won for many, many years and Pennsylvania, the same thing. It wouldn’t, but then Trump came along. We won them both. We beat Crooked Hillary, Crooked Hillary. Now we have a guy that makes Hillary look like a baby. No, we’ve had a good time. And until the China plague came along, everything was good. We closed it down. We saved 2 million lives. Now we’re opening it up. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had. See the hat, all the make America great again. Now we’re having it make America great again again. And our country was coming together. The other side was calling. Everybody was successful. Best numbers for unemployment, African American, Hispanic American. And by the way, do you see what’s going on in Florida? African-American, the numbers are phenomenal. Hispanic American, the numbers are beyond belief. They got problems. You notice they haven’t been talking too much about Florida for the last six or seven hours. They’re not liking what they see. Wow. That is a lot of people. Look, you can’t even see. Why don’t you take the cameras down there? You can’t even see the end. I hope you can hear us down there. It’s like two football fields away. I hope you can hear us. That’s great. Well, that’s really good, but no, Florida is looking great.

President Trump: (01:05:20)
You’re looking great. Came out two or three up. I don’t know why two or three up. Am I supposed to be happy with three up over this guy? I tell you, but you know what? Let’s just put the win in the column. We won’t even talk about it, but you’re looking great. North Carolina, great. Iowa came out. The big poll came yesterday you saw. And we were a lot up, big, big up. Well, the farmers like me. I got for the farmers $28 million. I got 28 million from China. Thank you very much China, thank you, because they targeted the farmers. They targeted the farmers. And I said to I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, “Sonny, how much?” He said, “Well…”

President Trump: (01:06:03)
Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture. Sonny, how much? He said, “Well, two years ago was 12 and last year was $16 billion, $16 billion, $12 billion, a total of $28 billion.” And I tariffed China. We took the $28 billion. We had a lot of money left over into the Treasury and we gave it to the farmers and the farmers are not complaining. I’ll tell you. They’re in business. They would have been out of business.

President Trump: (01:06:24)
Biden’s energy ban will send every state into crushing poverty. And you know this. You know what they’re doing. From Michigan, to Wisconsin, to Arizona, where we’re leading very nicely. Thank you. And to Pennsylvania. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on Earth. And we will remain energy independent. We’re energy independent for the first time. First time. That means we don’t have to call people up in far away places and say, “We need some oil, please. We’ll send our armies over there to protect you and help you.” But we do have great allies over there. We’ll help them. We’ve certainly helped Israel. But we have a lot of good people over there. We’ll help them. But we don’t need their oil. It’s nice not to. We have more oil than they do now. You know, we have actually more oil than they do. We’re the largest in the world. Isn’t that a nice feeling?

President Trump: (01:07:23)
Sleepy Joe, and that would not have happened except for what we’ve done over the last three and a half years. There’s never been an administration, or President, there’s never been an administration that has done in the first three and a half years what we’ve done, never and not even close. With all the things we’ve done. And the fake news never even questions it. I’ve been saying it for a long time. They don’t even question it because they can’t.

President Trump: (01:07:50)
Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless ridiculous foreign wars, countries you’ve never even heard of. A vote for Biden is a vote to extinguish and eradicate your state’s auto industry. You don’t like that. Do you? I don’t think so. You know, he was going to do the TPP. He was going to do different things that would have been so bad for you. I ended it. I ended it all. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA which was the worst trade deal ever made probably by any country that sent all your auto jobs. You know, they have 32% of our auto jobs, right? And it’s probably the number one reason I ran for President.

President Trump: (01:08:39)
And in fact, I was in Michigan. I don’t know if anybody remembers this, 12 years ago. They gave me the Man of the Year. You remember? I made a speech and I said, “Why are you letting, you know, it’s not my business,” but I said, “Why you letting them steal your auto jobs? They’re all going down to Mexico.” And by the way, plenty go to Canada, too right? People don’t know that. And it was a terrible thing that took place, but we’ve stopped that. And now the USMCA makes it very, very financially difficult for them to do that. It was very important to me. And everybody said, “We’ll never be able to do it. We’ll never be able to end NAFTA.”

President Trump: (01:09:15)
And you know why? Because it was so good for Canada and so good for Mexico. And they have a lot of power, but we ended it. And they’re not that happy, but they’re happy enough. And we have a great deal and I’ll tell you, Mexico, we’ve had a great relationship with Mexico. Canada is a little difficult to deal with, to be honest with you. You know, Oh Canada, we all love Oh Canada, right? I love that. They stand for their national anthem and we have to stand too, because you know, you saw the ratings from the NBA down 71% for their championship. You know why? Because people don’t want to hear it. They don’t want to hear it. They want to see a basketball game, obviously, not too much. But I didn’t watch it and a lot of people didn’t watch it. And the NFL has to be very careful. They tried that game two years ago and I thought we taught them a lesson, and they have to be very careful. We have to respect our flag, we have to respect our anthem, and we have to respect our country.

Audience: (01:10:15)
USA! USA! USA! USA!

President Trump: (01:10:30)
Sleepy Joe supported China’s entry into the WTO. Michigan lost half of all auto manufacturing jobs. After those Biden betrayals, they also supported the Trans-Pacific partnership, which would have been the death sentence for the U.S. auto industry. I canceled TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. And I took the toughest action ever taken against China. We never took in 10 cents on China. I’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars over the last three years.

President Trump: (01:11:07)
Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. They don’t want to write about it. They don’t want to write about it. They’re not allowed to write about it. Their bosses, whoever their bosses may be, they’re not allowed to write about it. Who sold out Michigan to China, he sold you out. That’s one of the reasons when they send over a car, they charge us 35% tax. We charge them nothing, But those days are changed. We changed it. We changed it. And it’s going to change a lot more if you give us another four years. That I can tell you. We were just beginning. We were just beginning.

President Trump: (01:11:45)
And not only with China, with everyone else that takes advantage of our country.

Audience: (01:11:49)
Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!

President Trump: (01:12:02)
Thank you very much. No, but with everybody else it takes it. It’s not only China. It’s everybody. We renegotiated the South Korea deal. You know. Crooked Hillary made that deal. It was going to give 250,000 jobs. She was talking, “This will produce 250,000 jobs.” They signed it and she ended up being correct. But the 250,000 jobs all went to South Korea, not to us. That was standard. That was standard. Biden is the living embodiment of the decrepit and depraved political crass. They got rich bleeding America dry. And you know what happened? Look, there haven’t been too many states that have been affected like you’ve been affected. You got seriously affected.

Audience: (01:12:48)
Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!

President Trump: (01:12:58)
That’s what we’re doing. We’re doing it. We’re doing it. But when I ran, you never told me it was going to be that deep, that vicious, that rough. It’s a deep sucker. I thought we’d knock it out fast. We went through three and a half years of hell and here we are, and they’re not too happy. And they’re reeling. They’re reeling. They’re going to be knocked off very soon. They’re going to be all knocked off very soon.

President Trump: (01:13:28)
No, we’ve done a good job, but it wasn’t easy. You get impeached over a telephone call that was perfect. Perfect call. A perfect call. Congratulations on your victory. Ukraine President, Ukraine, nice man. Never met him before. Congratulations. “Sir, could you call up and congratulate the President of Ukraine?” “Sure. What happened?” “Oh, he just won.” “Okay, good.” So I gave him a call. I avoided it for a long time because it was a lot, you know, busy. Call up and they say, “Let’s impeach him.” I’ll tell you. And we had great support from the Republican party. I have to say that, 197 to nothing and that. 52 and a half to one half. You know who the half was? That’s right. That we had 52 and a half to one half. Mitt Romney. He still doesn’t know why. He say, “Let’s see, what did I do?” He wished he didn’t do it. I’ll tell you that.

President Trump: (01:14:26)
In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as President to finally put America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, probably wouldn’t be here if I was. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fight harder and harder and harder and better than anyone’s ever fought for you. We were brought here. We were put here to fight for you. I had a very easy life before this. I have to tell you.

Audience: (01:15:14)
Thank you, Trump! Thank you, Trump! Thank you, Trump! Thank you, Trump!

President Trump: (01:15:25)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I had a very easy life. I had a different kind of a life and you know what? I wouldn’t have changed that decision when I said, “First Lady, let’s do it. You’re going to be First Lady.” She was actually one of the people. She said, “Are you sure you want to do this?” First Lady, people love the First Lady. They do. They love her. She’s good. She’s elegant and she puts up with a lot from these people, you know, it’s like unbelievable. But she said, “But are you sure you want to do this?” I say, “I think I do. Yeah. I think I do.” She said, “You know you will win if you do it. You must be sure.” And I said, “You think so?” I said, “Do you think so, really?” She said, “No, you will win definitely. But the question is, do you want to do it? And I said, “Yeah, we do. We have to set this nation back on the right course.” That’s right.

President Trump: (01:16:20)
No. She said that. I’ll never forgot that. That was sort of cool. It was just like second nature. You know you’ll win. You’re running against a lot of very talented people. And then we had to run against a very talented crooked machine.

President Trump: (01:16:33)
Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media and powerful special interests. You saw that over the last couple of weeks. All the corruption and they refuse to even talk about it. Could you imagine if I got three and a half million from the mayor of Moscow’s wife? Or one of my kids took three and a half million from… Can you imagine that? And they refuse to even discuss it. They don’t want to discuss it. There is no proof. They now say the laptop from hell was produced by Russia. This was Schiff, watermelon head, right? The laptop was produced by Russia. We say, “Oh no, not again.” No, John Ratcliffe came out immediately. He’s great. He’s doing a great job. He said, “It was not produced by Russia,” so. But that’s what they try and do. They do disinformation. They’re the biggest disinformation. I’ll tell you. They own him. They control Biden and they know he will always do whatever they want. They know that. That’s why they want him. I definitely don’t do what they want. I definitely don’t.

President Trump: (01:17:41)
Except I do one thing. I get them good ratings. Can you imagine if they don’t have me? Let’s say they had Biden. Their ratings will collapse. Every one of them will be out of business. There’ll be out of business so fast. They will be out of business so fast. In fact, I think they’re going to get together. The New York Times will die, the failing New York Times. Washington Post, which is basically a lobbyist for Bezos. You know that. But they’ll all get together and they’ll say, “Listen, we made a big mistake here. We got to draft Trump. We got to get him to run again. This is no good. We’re dying. Nobody cares.” Can you imagine then having Biden? we’re going to put something up. Can you imagine having Biden as your President? The biggest loser will be the fake news media. That will be so boring. You know, their ratings are through the roof. Everything’s through the roof. The NFL is doing very badly. You know why? Everyone’s watching politics because they find politics to be much rougher than the NFL. It’s much dirtier and more disgusting. And they don’t change. You know, in the NFL, they change the rules. They make everything like coming back. You can’t touch anybody. Somebody tackles too hard. They say 15 yard penalty and you’re out of the game, and you’re out for the season. You know, in the old days, right? It was a little different, but it’s still tough. But this is much tougher and people see it. But you have to see the ratings. That’s why the ratings are bad for a lot of the sports. Nobody ever thought of this. But I thought of it. A couple of people wrote it. The ratings to bed because so many people are watching this. It’s tougher. It’s true.

President Trump: (01:19:25)
But they’re going to be calling for us, “Please, please run again. We think we’re going to endorse you.” I got endorsed by the Pittsburgh, right, Pittsburgh Post Gazette. I got endorsed, first time since 1972 that they endorsed, right? It’s a big deal. Big newspaper, very good, very liberal newspaper, but that’s okay. But first time since 1972 that they endorsed a Republican, so it’s an honor. And if you don’t read the first two or three paragraphs, it was one of the best endorsements. “Yes. We don’t like him. Yes. He has a horrible personality.” But listen to this. It’s not that I do, but I have been under siege illegally for three and a half years. I’ve been fighting for three and a half years.

President Trump: (01:20:14)
And I said to somebody today, “I wonder what it would be like if the fake Russia hoax and all this crap with the impeachment over nothing.” Over a phone call that was perfect, that was perfect, I wonder what it would be like if we didn’t have all of this horrible stuff. You know, we’d have a very calm situation and maybe I’d be less popular. I don’t know. Maybe I’d be less popular. Because you know what the fact is, people see that we fight. We’re fighting for you. But it’s a really dirty, horrible business. But I said today, because were saying they don’t like the personality and he’s always fighting. I’m fighting to survive. You have to survive. Very few people would have survived. They would have been in the corner. They would have said, “Mommy, mommy,” put their finger in the mouth, put their thumb in the mouth and say, “Mommy, mommy, take me home. I’m out of here. Get me the hell out of here.” They’d say, “Forget about the American people. Mommy. I want out of here right now.”

President Trump: (01:21:16)
No, we can’t do that. But you have to fight hard and then you fight hard and you hit them back. And then they say, “There’s chaos in the White House.” They caused the chaos. We have a great group of people. We have a lot of them here tonight. Great people in the White House. But it’s true. I wonder if it would have been different. We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them trying to take out a duly elected President of the United States. That’s treason. That’s treason. We caught them. And someday, maybe something’s going to be done about it, too. You know? Maybe. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. We don’t want to do anything prior to the election. Well, what about me? They did it to me before. They spied my campaign before the election. We shouldn’t do anything prior to the election.

President Trump: (01:22:17)
And you know who we caught? Barack Hussein Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden. They were a part of it. We ought to get these reports out. They should get them out before the election as far as I’m concerned. They should get them out right before the election. Should have gotten them out a long time ago. We have information. You wouldn’t even believe it. I don’t even get involved. I always said I’m going to stay uninvolved. Very hard for me to do, I’ll tell you. No, it is because I didn’t have to do that. I thought it’d be the right thing. And yet they did the Mueller report, right? The phony Mueller report, 18 angry Democrats, smart, 18 angry vicious, many of them work for Hillary Clinton, 18 angry Democrats. They spent $48 million. And at the end of two and a half years, no collusion. Okay? Friend of mine said, “You have to be the most innocent of the world.” And they checked everything. They checked taxes. For $48 million, you check taxes. Right?

President Trump: (01:23:15)
And by the way we announced, you know, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes. They didn’t say that. They refuse to say. They say, “Well, prepaying isn’t paying.” I said, “No, it’s prepaying. That’s even worse.” Millions of dollars, many millions of dollars. And that’ll all come out. And you know, when you look at it, when you look at what’s gone on, seriously, think of that. Just think about that tonight when you’re with your family. I wonder if it would’ve been different. I wonder if it would have been a different kind of a feel. And you know what? Honestly, maybe it wouldn’t have been as good. Maybe we wouldn’t have these massive crowds, because you see what somebody is where we’re under siege, and you people get it. You’re smarter than them. You’re smarter than these people. You get it. And you’ve always gotten it and it’s a beautiful thing. And I’ll never forget it. I want to tell you, I’m never going to forget it. But we were under siege and we caught him and it’s treason or whatever you want to call it.

President Trump: (01:24:16)
But with sleepy Joe Biden, they don’t want to write anything. We caught the whole thing. The son. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? The son was like a human vacuum cleaner. He’d go in and follow his father. “Let’s go to China today, son.” They’d fly it on Air Force Two. Right? I guarantee you one thing. Mike Pence, I know his kids. They don’t do that. They don’t do that. They’re unbelievable kids, military. But you know, “Let’s go to China today, dad. I’d like to follow you.” Walks out with one and a half billion dollars fees. Oh, he must be a great investor. You know, the greatest investors don’t make that deal with China. China doesn’t do that. They don’t give money out for other people that are less smart than them to invest.

President Trump: (01:25:03)
Let’s give our money to somebody that’s not very smart to invest. Okay? That’s a great idea. He walked out. It only took him 10 minutes to get it to $1.5 billion. That’s millions of dollars in fees. The big one was the $10 million. You saw that one, the letter. He wants $10 million a year for introductory purposes. Okay? $10 million. But it all blew up. By that time, the laptop from hell was found. The one that Schiff said was developed in Russia. It’s unbelievable. And then you have Ukraine. He goes into Ukraine. His father was a judge of Ukraine, right? He was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, China, specifically. He goes into Ukraine, $183,000 a month. “Do you have energy experience?” It’s in energy. Right? Burisma. “Do you have energy experience?” “No, I don’t. I don’t know anything about energy.” “Well, we’ll pay you $183,000 a month and we’ll give you an upfront fee of approximately $3 million. Would that be satisfactory?” No. Think of it. No. Think of it. And there are other things, too. Then he’s got the brother and he’s got a whole… This is a corrupt enterprise. And then they had the big man gets 10%. The big man. Who’s the big? He’s not a big man to me. To me, he’s a very meek, fragile, he’s a fragile person.

President Trump: (01:26:22)
And he’s very agitated. I watched him today. He gets more time on Fox. I’ve never seen anybody on Fox so much. Him, they have everybody on Fox. They have all enemies on Fox. I think it’s crazy. But he gets a lot of time on Fox. But he’s so agitated. And now he comes out with the aviator glasses, but they’re a little too small. He wants to look like Tom Cruise from a long time ago. No, but he’s fragile. He’s not going to be there. That’s not what they’re counting on. They’re counting on somebody else. They’re counting on, by far, the most liberal person in the Senate, Kamala. They like her. They like Kamala.

President Trump: (01:27:05)
Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they support Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your auto plants, and you suffered for many, many years. I’m telling you, that’s why I’m here, I think, primarily. That was the first thing, trade. I said, “How could they do that?” They supported Biden. The open borders, lobbyists, that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime that poured into our country, they support Biden. They still do the anti-American radicals, defaming our noble history, heritage and heroes, they support Biden. They support him. They support Sleep Joe.

President Trump: (01:27:56)
And you know, I signed a law that you take down any of our statues, any of our monuments, you go to jail for 10 years. It’s amazing the way it seemed to have stopped. Isn’t it. It’s really amazing. Somebody said, “Oh, it’s just stopped.” No, it didn’t just stop. I took it old law and reactivated it, because the new law, and you go into this with this bunch, with Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer, you know what they’ll do? They’ll give you a medal if you rip down the statues. Antifa and the rioters, looters, Marxists, and left wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfish political class? Or do you want to be governed by the American people yourselves? You’re going to govern the way it supposed to be.

President Trump: (01:28:50)
A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists, and the communists, socialists, and wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silence, cancel and punish you. Cancel culture they call it, cancel culture. No, thank you. We want to be proud of our history. Good, bad, whatever, we want our history. We want to know. And we want to learn from our history. We don’t want our history canceled. We want to learn. There’s things we have to learn from our history, too.

President Trump: (01:29:23)
If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor, dignity, and respect, then I am asking you to go tomorrow and vote for a person named President Trump. Got to win Michigan. This is a big, important place. If we win Michigan, it’s over. It’s over. We win the whole thing. Four more years and then we can finish the job we started so well. We can finish the job. You know, I got nominated? No, I say it because they don’t write it. I just heard today. I thought it was three. I got four, four Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? One for the Middle East. One for Kosovo, Serbia. They want to make a trade deal. They’re each fighting each other, for many decades, they’re fighting, killing each other. You’ve read it. I mean, for years, they’re just automatic killing each other for many, many decades. And we’re doing these trade deals with them, not big deals, but they want them very badly. We’re doing them. And they’re each doing them.

President Trump: (01:30:32)
And I said to the people I said, “Listen, we’re doing deals. They want to make the deal with us. Everybody wants to make a deal with us.” I said, “They’re killing each other.” I think, right? They’re killing each other. I read about it. They’re killing each other for decades. “Tell them we’re not making a deal unless they get together and make a peace.” And we told that to them. We’re not interested in doing deals unless you guys can get along and not kill each other. You know, it’s human lives. We don’t know where it is. You don’t know where it is. Some people have never heard of the places, but they’re places. And they’re people. They’re human beings. And I said, “Tell them we’re going to do it, but you have to make peace.” And we got them together, we made peace. And they actually nominated me for the Nobel Peace Prize. I got four nominations in four unrelated things. That’s crazy, right?

President Trump: (01:31:16)
And I told the story, you probably heard about it. The first one I went up, Middle East. You know, the Middle East is coming along. No blood in the sand, no nothing. The Middle East is great. Signed already three countries. We have seven, eight, nine countries. They could all sign. I said, “How did Obama do it?” And they told me and I said, “Good. We’ll do it the opposite.” But not only Obama. For many, many years, they haven’t been able to do it. And I’d like to finish that up, too. We need a little more time, you know. We need a little bit more time. But we have countries lined up, no money and no blood in the sand, no blood in the sand. Remember what I said four years ago, “I am your voice and I will make America great again.” And that’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’re doing.

President Trump: (01:32:05)
Together, we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class. We will drain the Washington swamp. And we will save the American dream for your children, for your grandchildren. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown or a safe vaccine. The vaccine is coming along great, couple of weeks, a couple of weeks. It’s going to be out soon. That ends the pandemic and it will end anyway. They hate it when I say we’re rounding the corner. It’s going to end anyway. But the vaccine will make it go a lot quicker. And what we’ve done with therapeutics is incredible. Excuse me, here I am. But I like to say, no, no. I like to say it had no impact on me. I didn’t really need it. They just happened to give it to me because I’m a perfect physical specimen that’s very young. I’m very young and in perfect physical shape.

President Trump: (01:33:03)
No, but it’s amazing. What we’ve been able to do is incredible, really incredible. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few weeks and it will quickly eradicate this virus. You know, we’ve learned about it with our senior citizens, especially if they have a condition, a heart condition, they have some problem, any kind of a problem. Boy, it’s vicious. That’s the ones it really goes after. But we’re going to protect our great senior citizens first. And then it’ll go very quickly throughout for anybody that wants it. It won’t be enforced. It’s not going to be enforced. For people that want it, and we’ll get it done. And it’ll all take place very quickly. And by the way, nobody else would have been able to do what we did. You know, nobody else would have been able to do what we did.

President Trump: (01:33:51)
You know, Joe Biden, he handled the Swine Flu. It’s one of the great catastrophes. He was a mess. His own Chief of Staff said, “We had no idea what the hell we were doing.” I don’t know why this guy admitted that. I still, I can’t figure out why he admitted it. Probably before Joe thought he could ever run. You know, Joe thought his career was over because he wasn’t thinking straight. Then he ran and Elizabeth Warren said, “I want to stay until the end and take out Bernie.” You know, she took out Bernie, and we’re running against Joe instead of Bernie, and Bernie is going to run again though in another four years. He’s going to run again. One thing about that guy, he never gives up. Does he? But he’s a hell of a loser. I mean, he loses the first time and he goes back. He’s like, no hard feelings. He loses the second time horribly. The Democrats took advantage of Bernie Sanders and everybody that he represents.

President Trump: (01:34:45)
But they’re looking to take over Joe. They agreed to the manifesto. I call it. You have to see what’s in that one. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. That’s what he wants, locking you in your home while letting the far left rioters, so the rioters and the looters, the anarchists, Antifa, they can go knock the hell out of your room, your streets, set your stores on fire. No problem. That’s called protesting. We must protect our protesters, but you’re not allowed to go to church, you’re not allowed to have dinner, right? The only one allowed to have dinner in this state is the husband of your Governor. He’s the only one that’s got special privileges. That was not a good day when he got caught boating or whatever the hell he was doing. “Who are you?” “I’m the husband of the Governor.” The police didn’t go for that one too well, did they?

President Trump: (01:35:42)
No, that wasn’t a great day. No, you’ve got to open up your state, Governor. Open it up, Governor. Let the kids go back to school. Let the kids go back to school. It’s like Baron, Barron Trump, right? They said, you know, First Lady had it. I had it. They said, “Sir, you tested positive.” First Lady, they did come to see us [inaudible 00:30:03]. They said, “Sir, Barron, he just,” White House doctor, great doctor, Sean, “Sir, Barron just tested positive.” I said, “Tested positive for what?” “For corona>” you know, it sounds like… See, I like the China virus, or I like the plague from China. But a lot of people use it. Like, it sounds like an island in Italy.

President Trump: (01:36:27)
I said it’s not corona, but just tested positive for corona. I said, “Well, I don’t like that. That’s not good” Barron, you know he’s strong. He’s very tall. He’s only 14 years old and he’s very tall. I can tell, “Hi Barron.” And he’s a good boy. But he just tested positive. And I said, “Wow.” Then about 12 minutes later, I see the doctor. “Doctor, how’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay. He’s fine now. Took him about 12 seconds to get rid of it.”

President Trump: (01:36:56)
Because they’re young and they have a strong immune system. No, I mean, he got better so fast. And you know what I say? Let the kids go to school. You’re not going to hear that from the other side. They want to lock it up. The Biden lockdown down will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easter, no Christmas, no 4th of July, no future for the youth. Other than that, it’s going to be a great life. No, you got to let the kids go to school. Get going. Open up your state. It’s time. And you know, we got to take care of our seniors. We have to take care of people. We understand that we have to do things, but let the kids go back. This is a lockdown. This is a shut down. Of course, probably on a date like November 4th, they’ll announce. “Well, we’re going to decide to open up.” Right?

President Trump: (01:37:53)
Did you see the one head of the union said, “Yeah, we want the teachers to go back to work on November 4th.” That was not a good move. She announced, “We want the teachers to go back to November 4th.” Gee, I wonder why that day. Despite that we had the best numbers, look, we have states that are locked down, closed down, New York is having a hard time. I’ll tell you. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. Great place. I left it three and a half years ago. I loved it. And it’s very sad what’s happening to New York. A very, very sad thing in Chicago. Look at Chicago. It’s very sad. All run by Democrats, by the way, I want to just emphasize.

President Trump: (01:38:28)
How about Portland with the anarchists, right? They’re Antifa anarchists. But how about Portland? We could solve that problem in 25 minutes. Like we did, you know, we went into Seattle. We were ready to go in. We were all set to go in. And we told them we’re going in tomorrow morning. And the night before they said, “Okay, well, we’re leaving now.” That could have been done a long time ago if they asked us. We have to be asked. And we did a great job in Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota for two reasons. We’re going to win Minnesota. First time since 1972, we’re going to win Minnesota-

President Trump: (01:39:03)
First time since 1972, we’re going to win Minnesota, you know why? Number one is Ilhan Omar, the fact that she’s there. No, but she loves our country very much, right? She has a great deep and abiding love for our country and the other one, boy, the hatred is just crazy. How do we put up with this stuff, right? I mean, the hatred. But she’s the number one reason and maybe number two is the fact that the National Guard did one hell of a job in Minneapolis. Now they should have called a week and a half earlier, it would have been nice. You wouldn’t have had the fires raging, the anchors that said, “This is a friendly protest,” and behind the anchor it looked like the world was burning down. This is a friendly protest, see because they don’t report the truth. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdown’s, layoffs, and misery. You got to just get out of this. We can’t play games. Our country has such incredible potential we can’t let this happen.

President Trump: (01:40:02)
This country will never be a socialist nation, okay? And that’s what they want to do. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live the great, great life that you’ve always wanted to have, then go cast your ballot tomorrow for your all time favorite President, I hope, Donald Trump. Remember that Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, a respected guy, he worked with Biden. He said, “Biden has been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” Other than that, he spoke very well of him. But you don’t have to believe me, you don’t have to even listen to me because it happens to be Michigan. We spent a hell of a lot of money on that right there, so roll the tape.

Speaker 3: (01:40:58)
Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Joe Biden.

Speaker 4: (01:41:06)
Have you taken a cognitive …

Mike Pence: (01:41:09)
No, I haven’t taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That’s like saying you before got on this program, you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not, what do you think, huh? Are you junkie? By the way, that’s my little sister Valerie and I’m Jill’s husband. Oh no, hell, you switched on me. This is my wife, this is my sister, they switched on me. If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump then you ain’t Black. There’s not a single solitary reason in the world, why, why, as I said, we shouldn’t be in a position that everybody … That’s my wife, Jill. Hey, Jilly. I’m Jill’s husband, actually.

Mike Pence: (01:41:53)
And corn pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys and back in those days [inaudible 00:03:02]. Play the radio, make sure you have the record player on at night, make sure the kids hear words. We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men are created by the thing. Because if you were a quartermaster, you can sure as hell take care of running a department store thing in the second floor of the ladies’ department or whatever, you know what I mean? Well, I’m sick and tired of smart guys. Rapidly rising with, I don’t know. Ever been to a caucus? No, you haven’t. You’re a lying dog face [inaudible 01:42:55].

Speaker 5: (01:42:55)
Why attack Sanders?

Mike Pence: (01:42:56)
Why, why, why? You’re getting nervous, man. What kind of country are we going to be? Four more years of George we’re going to find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we’re going to be in a different world.

Speaker 6: (01:43:13)
Lie, after lie, after lie, after lie.

Mike Pence: (01:43:17)
We have to come together, that’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. And by the way, I sit on the stand and it gets hot, I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun and the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down [inaudible 01:43:40] and then watch the hair come back up again, they’d look at it. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap, and I love kids jumping on my lap. Barack and I think it’s a right for people [inaudible 01:43:56]. We have to do at least several things, one, we have to depend on what the President’s going to do right now. And first of all, he has to wait until the case before anything happens. Exacerbating the need for environmental justice. Folks, we got a lot of work to do. I don’t even need you to get me elected.

Mike Pence: (01:44:23)
We’ve never allowed any crisis from the civil war straight through to the pandemic of ’17 all the way around ’16, we have never, never let our democracy take second fiddle. We can both have a democracy and elections and at the same time, correct the public health. Everywhere I’ve been hearing all around the country, you’re trying your best but it never feels like enough. And here comes the train that he tried to make sure [inaudible 00:05:54]. All right. Anyway, I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical, as well as my mental fitness. I’ll lead an effective strategy, to mobilize [inaudible 00: 06:18].

President Trump: (01:45:41)
You can’t let that happen, you can’t let happen. This country is so great, we have such potential. We’re just starting to show our potential. If we didn’t get hit with the plague you’d see numbers, but we’re going to do it anyway. Next year, we’re going to do it anyway, it’s going to be incredible. We can’t let that happen, everybody knows it. And if he were a nice guy, he’s never been a nice guy, he’s never been a smart guy, never been smart, everyone knows it, never been smart. But if he was a nice guy, we wouldn’t even do that but that’s just a very small version, that’s not even the bad stuff. And one thing I can tell you, President Xi of China, Putin, Kim Jong-un, these guys are at the top of their game, they can’t have this. Well you don’t want to give them this, we’ll lose our country. We’ll lose our country, we can’t do it, we can’t do it. Biden would be a disaster for cherry growers, farmers, workers, all across your state. You do so many different things.

President Trump: (01:46:40)
Joining us tonight a representative, Jack Bergman. Two great guys. Jack, thank you very much and John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Thank you, fellas. Great warriors. They’ve been just incredible people. I’ll tell you what, they’ve been with me through everything, right? And we appreciate it. Are you in good shape with your races, you don’t need any additional help? They’re probably about 30 points up. When somebody is good, they’re good. You guys are great, thank you very much. And your next Senator, a tremendous guy, I spotted him a long time, I spotted him. There were five people running a little while ago, a year ago for a seat, frankly, you have somebody there that’s okay.

President Trump: (01:47:32)
But I saw this man and I said, “Roll it back. I want to see that again, John James, right?” And I said, “Wow, what potential.” And then I found out West Point, great student, great helicopter pilot. I’d trust him 100% to pilot my helicopter, I would do that 100%. No, he’s supposed to be a great warrior actually, I got him to run and he got his feet a little wet and then he just took off and I understand you’re doing very well to that poll, John, I hear. You want to come up here? Come here John. Come on over here John. Come on over. He’s a great guy and I hope he’s going to be voted in. You’re doing very well. Come on John.

John E. James: (01:48:27)
Mr. President, it’s an honor to have you back in our state. Are we grateful?

Speaker 7: (01:48:31)
Yes!

John E. James: (01:48:34)
Are we grateful for the United States of America?

Speaker 7: (01:48:38)
Yes!

John E. James: (01:48:38)
Are we grateful for our President who’s been back in Michigan more in the past six days then Gary Peters has in the past six years?

Speaker 7: (01:48:45)
Yes!

John E. James: (01:48:48)
It always tickles me a little bit when career politicians talking about what they’re going to do, but Joe Biden has had for decades in Washington and Gary Peterson said three decades in politics and we still have a life that doesn’t benefit all of us. We need to get leadership that’s been tested in the real world, people who understand how to create jobs in the real world, who can continue to bring results for everyone. So it’s my honor, it’s my honor, as a war fighter and as a combat veteran to stand before you here today and encourage you to go vote because only you can drain the swamp. God bless you.

President Trump: (01:49:37)
Good guy. Great man.

Speaker 7: (01:49:39)
Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

President Trump: (01:49:47)
That’s a big very important vote you’re casting in addition to our vote, John James, he’s a star. He’s going to be a star and you have somebody that’s very special. And his competition, nobody knows who the hell he is, Peters. You have a great State, Michigan. They say, “Oh, who’s the Senator?” Peters, Peters, “Who the hell is Peters everyone says.” Nobody knows who he is. He’s a puppet for crying Chuck Schumer I guess, that’s about it. Anyway, good luck John James, everyone. You have to do it. Okay. Another great gentlemen, house speaker Lee Chatfield. Good, nice to see you. I hear you’re doing good. And a woman who is special to this part of the world because she headed up our campaign and she kept calling, calling, please one more visit because a Republican hasn’t won Michigan for many, many years, decades, long time. So she’d call, “Please come over,” so I’d do it, “Come over.” Can I do it again? I came so much, I felt like I should become a citizen of your State.

President Trump: (01:51:08)
That could happen, that could happen. But she would just say, “One more time.” So now it’s toward the end, toward the end and I call and I said, “How we doing?” She said, “You’re going to maybe win, but you have to do just one more visit, that’s all.” So I did one more. I wished her well and I said, “Hey, the elections in three days and I want to just thank you for working so hard.” “Thank you very much, I won’t call you again.” I got home and I got a phone call from her. She said, “You need one more time, one more time.” And I came and we ended up, was that sometime? And I started speaking at 1 o’clock in the morning, now it was election day and we had 32,000 people, is that right? We had 32,000 people and I looked and I said, it was 1 in the morning. And Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary came and Bill Clinton came and they all came, the whole group, and it was an emergency because they heard they were going to lose.

President Trump: (01:52:09)
And when they heard that Rhonda called up and she said, “If you came, it’d be good,” because they were all coming it’s like an emergency. Now their visit was at 7 o’clock, which is prime time, they had 500 people. I started speaking at 1 o’clock in the morning, we had 32,000, so it’s now election day. She just got me and she loves your State, I will tell you that. And she was so good, I said, “You know what? We have to pick somebody now to run the RNC,” that’s the Republican National Committee, it’s a big deal. I said, “How about that woman from Michigan?” And I’ll tell you she has done a fantastic job. Rhonda, come on up here. Come on up. You want to talk here? Come here.

Rhonda: (01:53:04)
Thank you Mr. President. Hello Michigan! Lightening struck four years ago and we blew the minds of the media and the world when we delivered Michigan for President Trump, are we ready for lightning to strike twice?

Speaker 7: (01:53:22)
Yes!

Rhonda: (01:53:27)
Everyone get out and vote, we need to vote. Call your neighbors, your friends, your family, if you have wronged somebody make it right and get them to go vote. Let’s make America great again and reelect our fantastic President.

President Trump: (01:53:47)
She did a great job, we all love her, we love her, she’s fantastic. She’s got a spirit like you wouldn’t believe. Thank you Rhonda, very much and for the work. And I think we’re going to have a fantastic day. It’s going to be an incredible day and I never thought I’d say it, but this election is more important than 2016, I never thought I’d say it. This is going to be because we can’t allow this to happen to our country, this will be the most important election in the history of our country. It’s going to set a course, it’s going to go one way or it’s going to go another and if it goes the other way, it’s going to be a terrible thing, it’s going to be a terrible thing. So get out there and vote. We’re going to win this, we’re going to win it, we’re winning all over. They have no idea what’s going on, they have no idea. We see the real numbers and it’s no longer based on polling.

President Trump: (01:54:39)
The early voting is coming, they’re supposed to be way ahead, right? In the early voting, then we catch them on election day, I don’t know, for whatever reason, that’s the way it is. We vote on election day. They’re not way ahead and they’re having a lot of problems and they have emergency calls out to people. It’s going to be very interesting. Let’s do the great red wave, okay? And get that guy in to, John, we need them. We need them in Washington. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders, but now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back home to the good old USA. It’s about time. The troops are coming back. They’re policemen, we were serving as policemen all over the world, we’re policemen, no, it’s not what it’s all about. For 47 years Joe Biden, viciously attacked Black Americans. He called young Black men super predators. To every Black American I am asking you to go out and vote for Donald J. Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you and to betray you and nobody’s done it worse than him. I’m fighting for you, I got you criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, great guy, Tim Scott. And funding for historically Black colleges and universities, which were treated extremely badly. Under my leadership we achieved so much, so much. I said that, and I made the statement during debate, nobody saw the debate last week, did you? Nobody? Two weeks ago, it was a good debate. But I said, “Nobody with perhaps the exception of Abraham Lincoln,” a lot of people said, “Could you do the perhaps the exception out, please?” “has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump,” and that’s true. President Trump, all those things and more, and that’s good and you know what? It’s showing up to.

President Trump: (01:57:06)
When you look at Florida, take a look at those numbers tomorrow. And Hispanic, do you see what’s going on with Hispanic? Hispanic numbers in Florida, they’re saying, “What’s going on with Hispanic?” Hispanic Americans love Trump and I love them and I have a long time. The Black community is going to a level that we haven’t seen in a long time. It’s a beautiful thing to watch and they are saying, “What is going on?” This could be something very interesting that you’re going to be watching. You’re going to be watching some very good television tomorrow night. Very good television. Well, you have to say four years ago, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Remember how it started? This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. This will be very easy, very short and then they say, ” Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio,” but it wasn’t just that we won by eight points.

President Trump: (01:58:05)
Oh, by the way, Ohio’s doing great too. Then it’s, “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won Georgia, he’s won South Carolina. He’s one their firewall, North Carolina and he won it by a lot. What’s going on? Donald Trump has just won Wisconsin. He’s just won Michigan.” And they held Pennsylvania, even though if I lost every vote in the 2%, I still would have won by a lot, they held it. So you and Wisconsin got credit and that’s okay, right? But I just hope Pennsylvania, next time you take credit, so let’s do it a little bit earlier, please. No, we’re going to do fantastically in Pennsylvania but that was one of the most exciting evenings ever. And I think we’re going to duplicate it, I don’t know, could you ever surpass something like that? But we’re going to at least duplicate it and we need it to carry on what we’ve been doing. We’ve brought so many jobs back and all of those plants that we talked about, we have plants.

President Trump: (01:59:18)
You had nothing for 42 years it was just people leaving, nobody coming and now they’re coming back and they’re coming back in droves and the numbers are fantastic. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in U.S history. The Biden Harris group would increase refugees from terrorist nations by over 700% and that’s the manifesto that was agreed to with Crazy Bernie. Including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, right? You know that. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the entire Midwest into a refugee camp. You’re talking about tremendous amounts of people coming into our country. We don’t know who they are, we don’t know anything about them. I’m protecting your families in keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your country if that’s okay with Michigan.

President Trump: (02:00:18)
If that’s okay with Michigan. If it’s okay with you, we put the ban on because we want people to come into our country who are going to love us, who are going to help us, not people that are going to hurt us and blow up buildings. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, the largest investment in the military we’ve ever made, we have to do it. All made in the USA, a lot of it made right here in your great state, a lot of it. And we now have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world, fighter jets, F35’s, we have the best tanks, we have the best rockets and missiles. We have the hydrosonic missile that goes 7 times faster right now than the fastest missile in the world. If it went by us, we’d say, “What was that?” It would start over there before you could turn your head it would be over. 7 times, think of that, seven times faster, it’s incredible.

President Trump: (02:01:14)
And we have all of these things and our nuclear arsenal now is in tippy top shape and you know what I say? Pray to God we never have to use it. All of it, all of it, all of it. We’re making submarines the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before, we’re doing it all. And when I took over, it was depleted, our military was depleted, we had old fighter jets. You had to go to the desert, it was called the Graveyard for airplanes, right? And you’d strip planes that were sitting in the desert rotting in the desert and you’d bring the parts back. This was what we were flying in our airplanes. Now we have new tankers, we have the new super fighters. It’s incredible what we’ve done and much of it’s already here, much of it’s coming, but it’s all made in our great country. We just passed the VA choice in VA accountability and nobody thought that could be done and we just got, as I told you, 91% approval from our vets, our great vets.

President Trump: (02:02:15)
We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, people don’t talk about that. When I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place, we obliterated it. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. And we eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they were working on that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars we’re forging peace all over the Middle East, they’re all getting together, they’re all getting together. A vote for me and the Republican party and John James and everybody, it’s a vote for the American dream and in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, that’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help we will defend the right to life, religious liberty.

President Trump: (02:03:35)
You better get out there and vote. And we will defend keep and bear arms, you know keep and bear arms? It’s called the Second Amendment, which is under siege constantly. That’s where we need John and everybody to help us and our great congressmen, they’ve been so great and we appreciate it. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices beyond any levels you’ve ever seen, 60, 70, 80%. I’ve instituted favored nations that drug companies do not like me, they do not like me. They’re taking out more commercials, I think, than sleepy Joe, but we’re going to get it done. Our prices are the highest in the world for many years by far and we’re bringing them down to the lowest price anywhere in the world, matching the lowest price. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars.

President Trump: (02:04:51)
We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For Years, you had a President who apologized for America, now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan. Tomorrow you have the power with your vote to save America, you are going to save America. It’s the most important election, I say it all the time. This is the most important election our nation has ever had, I really believe that, never thought I would have said that in a million years, if you go back four years. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss and drag them out and say, ” Boss, come on, you got to get out and vote.”

President Trump: (02:06:03)
Get out and vote, so important. The red wave, I talk about it. The red wave, I think, is going to be far bigger. Look at all of these organic things that form in Iowa and the farm country, tractors, thousands and thousands of tractors. Yesterday didn’t they have 100 miles of cars? It was 100 miles. All over the country 4, 5, 6,000 boats with Trump, Trump and the American flags all over. Never happened. A movement like this has never happened before, it’s never happened and we have to keep it going and finish it out. From Midland to Mackinaw, from Lansing to Grand Rapids, and you know where my last stop is going to be? I’m sorry to tell you that, I feel a little guilty, but Grand Rapids was where we did that final great stop, Grand Rapids. And so, I’m going to be in Grand Rapids. It’s going to be my last stop. There’s something nice about that, right?

President Trump: (02:07:02)
Because you can believe it, I have five of these today and they’re all big monsters. I had five of these today, but I actually had six because yesterday in Miami, we left the stage at 1:30 in the morning. So somebody said, “If you want,” they said, “so if you want, you can say you did six today.” I think I’m going to say that. Nobody else could do six of these, you think it’s easy up here? It’s not easy. It’s freezing up here too. I got the wind, you don’t have that. I have the wind, I’m freezing my ass off up here, only for Michigan and from Battle Creek and right here in Traverse City, it’s a good place, right? It’s good a place. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, right?

Speaker 7: (02:08:06)
We love you!

President Trump: (02:08:07)
Raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come and I made that. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote. Thank you very much.
