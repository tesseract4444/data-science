Well thank you very much. Thank you. What a crowd. This is a very great place. We had a great victory here four years ago. And I just noticed their happened to be a poll out, that came out last night, that has a very, very substantial margin. We’re very happy with it. We’re very happy with it, and we’re very happy with Iowa, thank you very much Iowa. And we appreciate it. And we’ve had a great run together, and I’ve been working very hard with the farmers, and making them hopefully very rich. Making them very rich, and very successful, and hello to everyone here also from Wisconsin. We have a lot of people from Wisconsin.

All right. Let’s see. Who is from Iowa? And who is from Wisconsin? All right. That’s not terrible. That’s not bad. We just left Wisconsin, and we’re going back to Wisconsin. Two days from now we are going to win Iowa and we are going to win Wisconsin. And we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful White House. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, and ensure that more products are made, and raised, and grown in the USA. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening.

Next year we’ll be, I think we’re going to have the greatest year, economically speaking, in the history of our country. You saw the number that just came out. 33.1 GDP. That’s the best number in the history of our country. And we’re set. We call it a super V. We used to say a V, now we’re calling it a super V. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever, we’re truly something. We’re set. We’re all set. We were doing better than ever before. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and then we got hit by the China plague, which we’re not going to forget.

So we closed it up, we closed it up and then we opened it up, and we saved, I’ll tell you, we saved two million lives. It was 2.2 million people, were projected, we saved two million lives. But what happened, there shouldn’t have been one life. Shouldn’t have been. And we can never forget what China did to us, we can never forget. While foreign nations are in a free fall, you see what’s going on in other lands. Look at what’s happening in Europe. It’s a shame. We’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse.

A recent Gallup Poll found that 56% of the Americans polled said that they were better off now, much better off, it’s a record, than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. As president, I kept my promise. And I protected ethanol. And I approved E15 for use all year round. You don’t know what that means. That’s a lot. They’ve been trying to get that approved. Let me just tell you, for all of the ethanol people, and you have Joni, and you have Chuck over here, they fought with me. They were coming, they wanted it. And I said, “Can I give you just a little bit less.” “No, we won’t accept anything less.”

That’s Chuck, and Joni. They were tough, and they were good. But they didn’t have to fight me. They didn’t have to fight too hard. I was with the farmers. I was with them from the beginning. But if Biden gets in you can forget about ethanol, you can forget about everything.

You would have that terminated. You would have that terminated so fast. But authorized its use in existing gas pumps also, that doesn’t mean much to you, it means a lot to the ethanol people. So you have the existing gas pumps, you don’t have to go and spend a fortune to do the new gas pumps. Nobody knows that. And it doesn’t even sound very elegant in this speech. But you have the gas pumps to ethanol, and everything ends if Biden ever… It’s not going to happen with Biden, let’s face it. That’s not going to happen. That’s not going to happen. He would end everything that we’ve done. We’ve made this an incredible year.

I got 28 billion dollars from China that went to our farmers, because they targeted you. We opened new markets for Iowa farmers and ranchers. In Japan, the EU, South Korea, and all over the world. We surged exports with the new USMCA. We got rid of your horrible, terrible, worst trade deal ever made. Everyone said that would be impossible to do, we got it done. We got a lot done. We got a lot done. By the way, do you think it could be any windier up here?

I’m sitting here, it’s like… I’m standing up and this is one hell of a wind. It’s lucky you have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter, because these things are useless. They’re going. Yeah. They are useless. They’re moving in 17 directions, I’m going like-

Now, Sleepy Joe would be lost. He’d be-

“What am I going to do?” How about this, they ask him questions, he puts on a teleprompter, gives them… I’ve never seen this one. The hardest question he had recently was, “What flavor ice cream do you have sir?” He looks down. “I think vanilla and chocolate.” “Okay, thanks.” They don’t ask me questions like that. We confronted China’s cheating and made them double their purchases. They doubled up their purchases.

And three weeks ago you had the largest court order in the history of our country, right? This guy’s a corn guy. He’s a big corn guy, he likes Trump. You had the largest purchase of soybeans in the history of our country, and the largest beef order. You know why? Because China realized that I’m going to win. Because when you look… And they wanted to make me happy. Because what they did should not have been done.

They dream about Sleepy Joe Biden. They own Sleepy Joe. They gave his boy a lot of money.

Thank you.

Ah.

China goes, they go to bed every night and they say, “Please let it be Sleepy Joe.”

They would own the United States. You see the whole deal with him, right? With the son, with the 1.5 billion dollars goes to the son to manage. He makes millions of dollars a year.

Then the kid asks for 10 million a year, for recommendation purposes. He’s going to recommend. He gets 10 million. He wants 10 million a year. It’s a disgrace.

Nah, it’s a disgrace.

It’s a disgrace. And then he doesn’t have a job for four years, and he goes, and his father becomes vice president. And he wants $183,000 a month, right? From Ukraine. Ukraine, Burisma, oil company, not the best reputation. And then he said, “That wasn’t enough. Could we have three million dollars up front, please?” And then they get from Russia. They, Russia, Russia, Russia. Oh, by the way, the laptop from hell, all of a sudden-

Shifty Schiff, with the watermelon head, right Joe?

He comes out,  Schiff. He comes out and he said, “I think the laptop was developed by Russia.”

Russia’s probably going, “Oh my, here we go again with the-”

Can you imagine that? Three years, no collusion. 48 million dollars. A friend of mine said, “You’ve got to be the cleanest guy in the world. No collusion, no nothing. A waste of 48 million, three years, what a disgrace.”

And then they say, “The laptop came from Russia.” No, the laptop came from… Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter?

It’s called the laptop from hell.

How about though, the mayor of Moscow’s wife. Gives Hunter a check for 3.5 million dollars. He didn’t have a job. He was just… His father became vice president and he became… They were raking in money. And the father was supposed to get 10%, right? And then in another case he was supposed to get 50%. And the media doesn’t want to talk about it.

They put silence on it.

They put silence on it. And big tech, they’ll have to do something with Section 230 Chuck, I’ll tell you. They’re going to have to do something with Section 230, because what’s going on is bad. What’s going on could kill this country. They have to do something with Section 230. It’s time we stopped talking about it and get it done. We passed record… Because they wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Section… We gave them this unbelievable gift of no liability, and they’ve abused it, they’ve totally abused it.

We passed record middle class tax cuts. And we virtually eliminated the estate tax, so you don’t have a death tax. When you die, and at some point that’ll happen, there’s a couple of guys right here. Let’s see, eh.

When you die and you have a beautiful farm and you want to leave it to your kids, right? In the old days the kids would have to pay tax, and they’d go out and borrow the money, and then two years comes along and they end up losing the farm. No estate tax, no death tax, thank Chuck Grassley, and thank Joni Ernst, right? It’s a big deal. You don’t have the death tax, or the estate tax. It’s a big deal. Now, if you love your children… Who loves your children here? Okay. And who does not love your child or children?

There’s one hand of a woman in the very back.

So, if you don’t love them, it doesn’t matter that much, okay?

If you do, I did you one hell of a favor. You better remember that. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. No one has fought harder for the people of Iowa. That’s true. For the people, for the farmers. I fought for the farmers, for the ranchers. And China went after you, but I got the money for you because I got it a different way.

I spoke with our great Secretary of Agriculture, who I think is great, Sonny Perdue, he knows more about farming and agriculture. I said, “Sonny, how much did they hurt us two years ago?” He said, “12 billion dollars.” ” How much last year?” “16 billion.” I said, “Good. Take 28 billion dollars and we’re giving it…” I think it was proportioned right, I hope it was, I don’t know. Did anybody get a bad deal? Did anybody? Because you’re all wealthy.

But we took 28 billion dollars and we gave it to the farmers. And that’s why you’re all here, and that’s why you’re all happy. And no other president would’ve done that. And we had a lot of money leftover, because we tariffed China a lot of money. And they paid for it, you didn’t pay. The fake news likes to say you paid. You don’t pay, they paid. They devalued their currency even further and they paid. We got 28 billion dollars for our farmers, and I’m very happy about it, and so are they.

For decades, Joe Biden let other countries rip you off, rip off our country, and cheat America blind. And there was a group, they were just, they would let them do anything. Biden has been there for five decades. And the only people who benefited from his policies were himself and his family, frankly.

He shows up every four years and then goes back the Washington and caters to special interests. But my only interest is you. It’s very interesting. He’s raising… This sleepy guy is raising a lot of money, right? So he raises money. You know how he raises money? By making deals. That’s how you raise money. I would be the greatest political fundraiser in the history of the world. I could raise a billion dollars and give me two days.

Give me an extra day just in case.

All I have to do is, “Hey.” I know most of these guys one way or the other. “President of the United States is calling Mr. So-And-So from Goldman Sachs, etc.” “President.” “Oh, do me a favor send me 25 million please, for the campaign.” “Yes sir.” I would get… They wouldn’t even negotiate. I’d get so much, and I didn’t do any of it, right? And we did very nicely. We got a lot of small donations. But I didn’t do any of it, I never made a call. I never made a call. Everybody I called would give, I’m the president, I mean, unless you’re stupid you’re able to get a lot of money.

“Send me 10.” “Well sir, we’re having a hard time.” “All right. Send me five. That’s okay. Send me five.” I would’ve raised a billion dollars. But you can only spend so much. You can only buy so many commercials. We’ve got so many commercials, they have so many. But if Biden Harris… How about Harris? How about Harris?

Kamala, Kamala. You have to pronounce her name right. It’s Kamala, like a comma, Kamala.

And yet she pronounces her name differently than that, doesn’t she, huh? Did Mike Pence beat her in the debate or what? Did anybody see the debate last week? Our debate? Right? Everything he’d say, I’d say, “Well why didn’t you do it Joe?” “Well, he should’ve done that.” Really? First of all, everything I have done. I said, “Joe. You were there for 47 years and you only left 3.5 years ago. Why didn’t you do it Joe?” “Well, I never thought of that.”

But if Biden and Harris, the radical left, gain power, they will crash the economy, destroy your farms, and all of the things I got you, like the estate tax. That’s going to be ended. They don’t want that. They fought us on that. And then America as we know it, you’ll have a socialist country. And America will never be a socialist country. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil industry. This would be a death sentence, as you know, for ethanol. So all of those people I’ve gotten to know. I’ve gotten to know a lot of the ethanol people through Chuck and Joni and Kim, all of them. Yep, by the way, you do have a great governor, you know that right? I don’t even know. I don’t even know if she’s here. Is she here? There she is. I can’t see her under all that stuff.

Well, she’s definitely wearing a mask, I will say that.

She’s a great governor. The Biden Harris plan would outlaw American energy, would unleash economic misery for Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and every other state in America. Your energy costs would go up at a level that you’ve never seen. He wants to raise your taxes. And it’s not him. He has no clue. He’s shot, okay?

The guy has no clue. You know it, I know it, we’re all trying to be nice. But I knew him also for a while, he’s not a nice guy. If he was I wouldn’t talk this way. He’s the only man that ever-

… if he was, I wouldn’t talk this way. He’s the only man that I’ve ever seen, his whole campaign is, “We will raise your taxes.” I said I’ve never heard of it. All my life I’ve watched politicians, I grew up with politicians, they’re always saying, “We’ll cut your taxes.” He’s the only guy I know that says, “We’re going to raise your taxes.” So I cut your taxes with them, the highest level cut in the history of our country. He wants to raise your taxes more than anybody has ever raised your taxes. Let me just ask you, how do you get elected? I mean, aside from right, wrong, how do you get elected? So he wants to give you the largest tax increase in history. Now for one year he went along the  he had 27 people running, right? Some ran well, some didn’t go so good. Well, Kamala didn’t do well, she was dropping like a rock and she was mean to him.

And everybody’s against fracking, okay? It doesn’t pertain to you, but it does as your energy cost because you want your bills to be low, so he’s going, “No frack, no frack, no fracking. There will be no fracking.” We’ve got a little play. I don’t know if they put it, they did, we spent the money for Iowa, look, see that? That board is expensive as hell. Whoa. Hey, Iowa must be a very important place. We’ve got a little show. We’ve got a little show. Look how beautiful. You see a beautiful board, I see a lot of money was spent on that. Wait until you see it, it’s incredible what they can do for money, but you’re going to see it in a second. But he goes, “No fracking,” for a year. “No fracking, there will be no fracking.” So he said this 100 times and then he goes to Pennsylvania and he goes, “I believe in fracking. We will have fracking.” And the fake news, look at all of them back there, every one of them, they’re fake and they’re more fake now than they ever were.

When are you going to look into Moscow and the three and a half million? When are you going to ask Moscow? I want to find out why did Moscow give where’s Hunter three and a half million? It must be his expertise. Where is Hunter by the way? Remember I said, “Where’s Hunter, is he here?” And then the next day they made a T-shirt. It was the number shirt of the year, where’s Hunter? No, but we want them to ask that question instead of what flavor ice cream are you having? They’ll terminate your school choice, eliminate your charter schools to fund religious schools, ban prayer in schools, indoctrinate your children, anti-American lies and force you to subsidize extreme late term abortion, that’s what they’re doing. That’s all in their platform, you got to read it. We call the manifesto between crazy Bernie, yeah, Bernie whose one of the greatest losers of all time. No, think of it. They stole two elections, not one. I’ve seen people where an election got stolen and by the way, we’re not going to let that happen to us with these ballots.

How about the Supreme Court ruling where the Supreme Court, no, this was not good, the Supreme Court gave them more time, more time. So what does this mean? Does this mean we go and we wait, so it’s not November 3rd, it’s going to be much later than that? No, no, we should know the result of the election on November 3rd, the evening of November 3rd. That’s the way it’s been and that’s the way it should be. What’s going on in this country? What’s going on? We believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Biden and Harris will eliminate the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans, their socialist takeover will ration care and force you onto endless wait lists. You’re going to have wait lists, you know what we’ve done by the way for the military has been incredible. We’ve gotten rid of the wait list for our veterans.

Our opponents would pack the Supreme court with far-left justices and by the way, we’re into the voting now. It’s ridiculous, I liked election day and most of you do too, who is going to vote on election day? Okay. And who’s already voted? Okay. And you sent ballots in? Be careful with the ballots, be careful. Just be careful with those ballots, I don’t know. Our opponents would pack the court, but remember, a lot of people have already been, he has never said if he’s going to pack the court, he’s getting along the tap, tap, he’s doing a little tap, tap, tap. So he has not said until he says he’s not going to do that, you can’t vote for him and then on top of it, I created a list of 25, now it’s 45 and we just got a great one approved, these two approved them. Amy is going to be fantastic, right? Amy, they all love Amy. She’s going to be a fantastic, for a long time a Justice of the Supreme Court, she’s going to be there.

And we picked two other great ones and we’re very happy. We have three Justices of the Supreme Court. Many Presidents have never had a pick, they’ve never had a pick and I’ve had three, that’s just blowing their mind. Look, they’re saying, “How the hell did this happen? This guy is driving us crazy.” Well, the other thing we’ve done is, thank you to President Obama, he was unable to get anybody approved, he waited so long and we had little help too with the Senate to put it mildly, but he waited so long if you go early enough, you’ll get them through. And we ended up with 142 federal judges, but that’s nothing. So we’ll have, by the end of my first term, we’re going to have almost 300, could be more, 300 approximately 300 federal judges. So that’s 300 federal judges, three Justices of the United States Supreme Court. But Bernie never created a list, I have a list, so I take one from the list. People didn’t like it, they don’t vote for it because it’s they say the most important thing that a President does is Supreme Court Justices and judges. And he hasn’t given us the answer yet and he hasn’t given us a list and he can’t because they want far left maniacs and he won’t be able to get the votes. So you know what? He’s tapping you along, he doesn’t know he’s doing it, but he’s actually doing a very good job of it because people are voting and he still hasn’t given a list and he hasn’t said whether or not he’s going to pack the court. Look, nobody in this group is voting for this guy, nobody. He’s not qualified, he wasn’t Qualified in primetime, 25 years ago, he wasn’t qualified because he was never known as being the brightest bulb in the Lot. When it comes to your second amendment, they want to shred it. They want to abolish religious liberty and they want to ban God from the public square and you’ve seen that. So the Pledge of Allegiance during the Democrat convention, right? See, it’s supposed to be democratic, but it’s really not, it’s Democrat. Doesn’t sound as good that’s why I use it all the time.

No, it should be the Democrat, they should change their name it sounds nicer, I hate to even say it, but the Democrat convention or the Pledge of Allegiance they took the word God out and I heard it I said, “Oh,” you know that, I heard it and I said, “Oh, they must’ve made a mistake. They had a typo maybe, we’ll call it a typo.” And then I heard it a second time. And I think by the way, God is looking at us and saying, “We want to give you a nice, cool day today,” because that wind, I don’t know about you, but that wind is hitting me hard.

Look at these flags. Why the hell did my people put the stage right here for? And there’s the great Ivanka Trump who’s standing right there. Come here, Ivanka, come here. My poor daughter, she’s standing there freezing. Iowa’s not like this all the time, they wouldn’t grow great corn if it was like this. Look at that, it’s Ivanka Trump. Wow. I looked over here, I’m looking at the flags, those beautiful American flags that we love and respect and I see my daughter. Hello Ivanka. Would you like to hear from Ivanka? Come on.

That’s Ivanka. I said, “Ivanka, go down here. It’s warmer.”

Thank you. Boy, it looked cold out there. She’s all by herself under the flags. I said, “Stand next to Chuck Grassley where it’s nice and warm.” Chuck will keep you warm. He’s great. He’s a great guy, I’ll tell you that. The Biden/Harris agenda is they war on workers, they war on faith and a war on our police. To defend your God-given rights I appointed justice, Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. We will defend, protect and preserve the American way of life. Joe Biden is the candidate of rioters, looters, arsonists, it’s hard to believe but you take a look at what’s going on in Philadelphia, he doesn’t even want to condemn it. Gun grabbers, flag burners, Marxists, lobbyists, and special interest. Other than that, he’s not a bad guy, right?

I’m the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, hardworking people, law abiding patriots and every race, religion, color, and creed. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, that’s because I’m not a politician, thank you. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought before. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and we know that, we know that, we have found that out. You don’t have to take my word for it. I’ve done something for you today that you’re going to love. Roll that screen right there, roll it.

Oh, we save a lot of words, don’t we? We save a lot of words. Our country has such unbelievable potential, let’s not blow it, go vote. This election is a choice between a Biden depression or a Trump super boom, we’re going to be booming. We’re going to have the greatest year, you had the best year we’ve ever had last year, we’re going to have the best year next year, we’re set for it. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown, he wants to lockdown, we’re never locking down or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and frankly, we’re going to end it any way. The vaccine’s are coming, they’re coming in a matter of weeks. It’s all set, we’re going to be delivering them to our elderly, we’re going to start with the elderly, the military, logistically are the best in the world, they’re going to be delivering it. And without the vaccine, you can have the vaccine, but without it, we’re rounding the corner.

Thank you.

Thank you.

That’s really nice, I’ll tell you. That’s never been a chant that anybody’s ever heard. Even Chuck Grassley has never heard. We love Chuck Grassley, don’t we? No, but I’ve never heard of that one, Chuck. Not Reagan, not anybody, they’ve never heard, so it’s good. I appreciate it very much and I love you too, I do. We’ve developed groundbreaking therapeutics, excuse me, here I am. I took something that was pretty good because I woke up and I said, “I feel great, boom, Superman, right?” That’s true. And the first lady got it and Baron got it, now Barron’s a young guy, 14 and the doctor came to see me and he said, “Sir, your son tested positive.” I said, “For what? Tested positive for what?” “For COVID.” I think he used COVID, there’s about 29 different names we can use, the China plague. I think he used COVID, “He tested for COVID,” and I go, “Wow, that’s bad, that’s not good.”

Wow. That’s bad. That’s not good. 12 minutes later I saw the great White House doctor. “How’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay. He shed it. No problem.” So like 12 minutes. I said, “Barron, you feeling okay?” “Yeah, what was wrong? I had nothing wrong with me.” Young kids have a strong immune system, they knock the hell out of it. Send your kids back to school. We want to go back to school, right? For those states, Pennsylvania, frankly, the governor very bad lock down, and North Carolina, we’re winning in North Carolina, by the way, you know what’s going on, right? We’re winning in Florida. We’re winning in North Carolina. We’re winning in Pennsylvania. I think they’ve given up in Ohio. I think they’ve given up in Florida, frankly. And I think after the poll I saw from that very nice newspaper, that usually doesn’t treat me so well, but they treated me very well. I think maybe they’re going to give up on a place called Iowa pretty soon, too. I think they’ll give up on Iowa pretty soon.

We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks and we will quickly eradicate the virus, wipe out the China plague. We just want to get back to normal. That’s all we want. We don’t want much. We don’t want much. Just, let’s get back to normal. We had the greatest economy seven months ago, and then we had the plague. That’s not good. Think of what China has done to the world. Think of it. Now, just think. I see people that come in, they’re wrapped up in masks and, how you doing? Don’t touch. Don’t get close. Seriously, think of what China has done to the world. I had a group of people, not so long ago at a place, nice place. And they said, “President, President, could we say hello?” They’re wrapped in masks and it’s terrible. And they said, you couldn’t hear him because the mask. One person had the world’s thickest mask I’ve ever seen. I mean, and then the scientists was there. That one’s no good. That one’s okay.

But they’re saying, “President, President.” Successful people, good people. And I’m saying, “Look at these people.” I said, “Look at these people.” What China has done to us, but what China has done to the whole world, they could have kept it in. They kept it in from China, they had the Wuhan province, they kept it in. But it got out to Europe, to the US, and all over the world. Think of what they’ve done to us. Forget about their trade deal with your corn, okay? On the bigger picture, we did that great trade deal, but the ink wasn’t even dry. And all of a sudden, we got hit by this damn plague and we won’t forget it. We’re not forgetting it. And you can never forget it. We can never forget it.

The Biden plan will turn America into a prison state, locking you down while letting the far left rioters roam free to loot and burn. Think of it. Think of it. You can’t go to church. You can’t go to school. You can’t do anything. You have to stay in your house. But if you’re a looter, an anarchist, a rioter, you can run down the streets of Portland. You can run down the streets of anywhere you want. And there you have no problems. In fact, we got to a point because we were shut out from having protests, right? Rallies. So they said, “Well, you can’t have a rally, sir. You’re not allowed to have anything political.” I said, “What can you do?” The only thing you’re allowed to do is protest. I said, “Good. Let’s call our rallies from now on, protests.”

So this is a protest. We are protesting, but your governor wouldn’t do that to us. We don’t have to worry about Iowa. We don’t have to worry about Iowa. No, but you have some places, Minnesota. You saw that, we had 25,000 people that wanted to be there. And the attorney general, well, I will say one thing about him. He was the first one, I think, or just about, him and one other person. On day one, he said, this is four years ago, “You know that Trump is going to win, don’t you?” They said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Trump is going to win.” So in one way, can’t be so stupid, right? But the attorney general and the Governor of Minnesota said, “No, we can only allow 250 people.” We had 25,000 people that wanted to go. So I went there and they thought that I’d cancel for 250 people, because we’re drawing 25, 30, 40,000 people to every rally. So they figured I’d cancel. I said, “Nope, we’re not going to cancel on Minnesota.” Minnesota hasn’t been won by a Republican since 1972. And we’re going to win Minnesota because of that.

And actually, had we had the rally, we’d have 25, 30,000 people there. Thousands of people showed up and the governor had them locked out. Frankly, that was a much bigger statement than if we had the rally. If we had a rally, we would have had a big, beautiful rally, but it was a big statement. But between that and Omar, Ilhan Omar, she’s a real winner. Ilhan Omar, who obviously hates our country. She likes to tell us how to run our country. How the hell she gets elected anyways, hard to believe, but she’s in Minnesota. And the other thing is we stopped, I said, “You got to let the National Guard in,” they have to ask us, right? I said, “You got to let in the National Guard.” Well, a week and a half later, they let the National Guard in, and we stopped in, what would you say, 22 minutes? Remember, wasn’t that beautiful?

I mean, look, sometime, this week and a half they’re burning down Minneapolis, burning it down and CNN’s covering it. That reporter, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas. , he said, “I’m down, I got hit.” Don’t worry. It was only tear gas on the knee, he was down. But he was saying, “This is a friendly protest.” And you looked over his shoulder, right? The entire city was burning down. Did you see that? There’s a famous picture, the thing must’ve been like 10 blocks long. They should have called us sooner, but we put it out in about 15 minutes, maybe 20. That was a beautiful sight though, they just came in one, two, three, then all of a sudden more, more, you could just see the busloads. And they walked down that street with pepper spray and tear gas. And it was pow, pow. Everybody got, I’m telling you, less than a half an hour. It was all over. That thing lasted for two weeks.

Biden calls these lockdowns a dark winter. Wasn’t he inspiring at the debate? How bad was he? Look, I’ve debated guys that had intelligence. Look, I had a debate crooked Hillary four years ago, but I mean, at least she was as an intelligent person, she’s gone a little wacko. No, Hillary, you lost. Remember she said to me, “Will you respect the decision of the people?” And I sort of said, “Maybe.” I wasn’t perfect. I said, “Maybe, if there’s no cheating.” We have to be careful with cheating, right? But then she didn’t respect. And what did they do? They went on a witch hunt for years and years and they spied on my campaign and we caught them spying on the campaign. And now they say, “Will you respect the decision over the voters? And will there be a friendly transition?”

First of all, there’s not going to be a transition, we’re winning. But then you say, then you say, “Well, let me ask you. Four years ago, was there a friendly transition?” They were spying on my campaign before I even won. And what was worse was they were spying on my campaign after I won, to overthrow the President of the United States, okay? Which is called treason, which is called treason. And let’s see what the hell happens. I don’t know why it takes so long, but it takes a long time. I’ll tell you that man right there, Chuck Grassley is one of the most effective people. He’s one of the people that, he’s one of the people that does not want to let them get away with it. And I appreciate it, you know that. No, he’s one of the most effective guys. He was the man. He looked at Comey. Remember when Comey lied in front of Congress? He looked at Comey, he said, “Did you leak?”

Chuck is tough, when he’s talking regular he’s the toughest guy in the room. And Comey’s a liar. Worst Director in the history of the FBI, beyond the worst director. He was a bad guy. But Chuck Grassley is interviewing him, ask him. Then he looks at him, “One more question,” sort of like Columbo, right? I have one more question. Remember Columbo, hey, hey, hey, just one extra little question. So here he is, perry Mason also, always the last question, that was true. That was true during the debate, when he said the oil. I said, “Whoa, this is the biggest question of the night.” But with Chuck, he said, “Did you leak?” “What?” “Did you leak?” “Ah, yes. Yes I did.” And I’m sitting there saying, “I don’t believe this.”

Oh, we love Chuck. What a piece of work Chuck is. What a piece of work that man is. I like that guy. He’s tough as hell though. It’s true. I guess I was only giving the ethanol guys 99%, and Chuck couldn’t stand that, he wanted them. He wanted you people to get 100%, right? I said, “Chuck, I’ve got the papers all ready to sign.” “I don’t like them.” “Why?” “You didn’t get that one little thing, that one little morsel for the other side.” A little morsel right for the other side. Happened to be the oil industry. I said, “Could we give them something?” And it wasn’t any good. We love you, man. We love you. He ended up getting a hundred percent. But it all goes away with Sleepy Joe, just to remember that, Chuck.

The Biden lockdown will result in countless deaths, destroy millions in small businesses and wipe out an entire generation of hopes and dreams. Earlier today, one of his top advisors again confirmed their desire for a shutdown. The damage to children, you know that, you saw that, it was in the news. They want to shut it down. I don’t know. These people are crazy. We’ve got a thing that’s rocking and rolling. And it doesn’t work. The damage this will inflict on children, teenagers and young adults is absolutely cruel. The far left has always yearned to wield the unchecked power. That’s what they want is the power. I think it’s more than the power. I think it is the power and maybe the money. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you cast your ballot for me and you have to do it on November 3rd.

You got to get over there, joining us today, got to get it done. We got to get it done. We got to get this election behind us and get to work. We have some great people in government. We have some great people that want to come into government, and our nation has unbelievable potential. I didn’t watch much of Biden’s speech. He made a little speech, little tiny. He does very short speeches, very short, they’re the shortest speeches I’ve ever seen, actually. He just wants to go home to the basement. He doesn’t want to be. He is the most unhappy warrior I’ve ever. Did you ever see? He’s agitated, he’s just angry and agitated and he doesn’t want to be there. And now he’s starting to lose in the polls and it’s driving him crazy. So what does he do? He brings in Barack Hussein Obama and you know what happened to his attendance? It went down, his attendance, it actually brought it down.

They called and they said the other day, a couple of weeks ago, they said, “Sir, have a little bad news.” “What?” “Barack Hussein Obama is going to a campaign with Biden.” I said, “Why is that bad news? That’s good news. He campaigned with Hillary, and that was when she started really getting beaten.” Remember that? He campaigned. He’s a highly overrated person. Well, he gave us 142 judgeships, we’ll take it.

Joining us today are some incredible people. And if they want to come up and freeze their ass off, they’re fine to come up. See you people are there and you’re nice and warm. I’m up here all by myself. That’s why I said, I said to my daughter, oh look, is that Hope Hicks? Where’s Hope Hicks, the great Hope Hicks. Get her. Is that Sarah Huckabee? You look like, come here, Sarah. You know what? You look like Hope Hicks. I thought Sarah Huckabee was Hope Hicks. Come up here Hope Hicks. The great Hope Hicks. Boy, we got them all. Come here, Sarah. How good is Sarah? Look at Sarah. Come up here, Sarah. Look at Sarah. She did pretty well being with Trump, right?

You want to go down here? It’s warmer. Thank you. Thank you, Sarah. She could be Governor of Arkansas one day. I don’t know. Is that? Where’s Hope? Come here Hope. You know Hope, Hope Hicks. Come here Hope, come up here. The great Hope Hicks. Do you know Hope Hicks? She’s become very famous, very powerful woman. Very powerful. Look at her. Are you cold enough, Hope? Come on up, Hope. Are you having a good time?

She does a fantastic job. I don’t know if she loves public speaking, just say hello.

Thank you. Good job. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks Hope. So we have a person that you know very well, who’s considered one of the best governors in our country and she is, and I work with her. She’s another one. She’s unrelenting. You had a little flooding problem, to put it mildly. You were like a swimming pool for a period of time. And Kim was on the phone. “Sir, we need money for the dykes, the dams,” whatever the hell we were calling them. “We got to get money.” And I said, “All right, Kim, is this enough?” “No sir, we got to have more and more and more and more,” but that’s what a good governor is, right? The ones that don’t call, they’re not as good, but we don’t want to tell them that. But she’s really considered one of the greatest governors in our country. And she’s a great person. A great husband, she’s got a great warrior husband too. I will tell you that. Kim Reynolds. Come on up Kim, if you can. Come on up.

Thanks Kim. Great job. Thank you, Kim. She’s a dynamo, huh? Wow. I would say, whoa. Thank you, Kim. And Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg, Adam, thank you very much. Thank you. Doing a great job, Adam. Are we doing okay Adam? We’re doing good? Good. Bring it home Adam. Also with us, are two people, one is running and the other one doesn’t even have to run, even when he’s running. They say he might be the only politician in America who’s just not beatable. People don’t even run against him. He’s a great guy, but let’s get, because we have to do this. We have to get Joni Ernst elected. She’s fantastic. She’s so good. Joni, come up. Joni is fantastic and special woman, and she loves your state and she loves our country. Joni, please.

Thank you Joni. Thank you, Joni. Yeah. Get out and vote for Joni. She’s a terrific person and she really fights hard for the state, she really does. She really goes all at it. And the man that we’ve been talking a lot about today, I’ve talked about him so much and everybody knows who he is. Everybody in Washington respects him. Most people are deathly afraid of him, but I’ve gotten to know him. Actually, when you get to know him, he’s actually tougher than you even think-

Actually, when you get to know him, he’s actually tougher than you even think. But he’s a great man. He really is. He’s a great man. He’s been a great senator. I think somebody said he’s never missed a vote in all these years. And I’d love to have… either stay there or come right up here, Chuck. But we would love to have you. Chuck Grassley, really a legendary guy. A legendary guy. He really is. He’s something special.

That’s right. I am.

Thank you very much. Great job, Chuck. Thank you. Unique man. Great guy. Agricultural secretary Mike Nagy. Where’s Mike? Where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. How’s it going? Okay. Your agriculture is strong. You got a check for 28 billion, your percentage, right? How did you split that up? But you did a good job. And somebody that happens to have a very good end named Pat Grassley. You know, Pat? Pat Grassley… We talked about that. What good genes he’s got? And another man who has done a fantastic job. I hope he’s here. But he was your governor for 24 years. He set the record. And he told me a story. A story that many, many years ago, he met a man in China, and he came home and he told his wife, they were young men together, and they were buying corn or… One was a buyer. One was a seller. I don’t know how the hell it worked.

But he met a man, and his name was Xi. His last name Xi. Then he came home years ago, many years ago, and he told his wife, “I have just met a future president of China.” And they were friends after that. And it turns out to be President Xi, current president Xi, the president of China. And when I met President Xi, he said, “Terry Branstad, the governor, is a very good friend of mine. We’ve known each other for 35 years.” So, Terry becomes governor again… 24 years. Longest serving governor in the history of the country. Okay. When you’re a governor for 24 years, that’s a long time. And I called him, in the middle of his term. I said, “Terry, they like you and China. President Xi has great respect for you. How would you like to be the ambassador to China,” and he said, “You know, sir, I think after 24 years, maybe it’s time.” And he represented us so well. He is so smart and so tough. And so we’re a… Come on up here, Terry. What a great job he’s done. So he wanted to come back, and he wanted to make sure that we get reelected. That’s what he wanted to do. But what a job he’s done. Thank you very much. Please.

Great job. Thank you. What a great guy. We have great… You have great people. There’s a lot good genes in this state, right? Thank you very much. Is Eric here? Is your son here? Where’s… Where? Oh look at you. I didn’t recognize you with that big, beautiful hat on. Are you doing good? Are we doing okay? That’s great. He has a father who’s very proud of him, I have to tell you. Thank you, Eric. Great job you’re doing.

And Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann. He’s been fantastic from day one. Thank you, Jeff. It looks good, Jeff, huh? Looking good, Jeff. Take it through. You bring it through, Jeff. I have no doubt about you. He’s a great chairman. One of the best. Congressional candidates, Ashley Hinson, who’s unbelievable. Come here quick, Ashley. Come here, Ashley. And Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and Esther Joy King. Come on up here. Come on. Get up here. Say a couple of words because you are doing fantastic .

Thank you. Thank you.

Nice to meet you.

Great. Thank you very much. Great people. Really great people. And we have, we’ve rebuilt the entire military. We’ve rebuilt it over three and a half years, and that’s why we can’t worry too much about budgets. They can’t say, “Gee, we kept within budget,” but who are those people running up the White House lawn? We don’t like that, right? Now we have the strongest military now that we’ve ever had. Strongest in the world, by far.

Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in American history. As you probably know, the wall, which they no longer want to talk about… The wall is almost complete. We did 412 miles. We’re doing approximately 10 miles a week, and it’s done to the highest standard what the border patrol desired, and it has been amazing. And we have now the safest Southern border, and Joni and Chuck worked very much with me on that, and it’s been amazing. We really had a great success. That’s why you don’t hear about it anymore. That’s why you don’t hear about it anymore. They used to love it when they didn’t think we’d get it built. We had a hard time. That was a hard one. The Democrats were a wall. They were their own wall. Remember they said walls don’t work. I said, “walls work and wheels work,” right? Everything else becomes obsolete very quickly.

Joe Biden is fledged to free healthcare for illegal aliens. That would bankrupt your Medicare, and totally bankrupt, destroy Social Security. I will always protect Medicare and Social Security. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. Military. We now have the greatest equipment we’ve ever had. We have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. We are the envy of the world, Russia, China, North Korea. We are the envy.

We have the best planes, the best fighter jets, F-35 Stealth. You can’t see them. They’re very, very tough to see. Very tough to beat a plane in the air when you can’t see it. But we have the best planes, the best ships… Submarines, we’re doing submarines like nobody’s ever seen before. We have the best rockets and missiles. We have the best of everything. And our nuclear now is tippy top. And just hope to God we never have to use it. You know that, right? You know that. And the best way that we won’t have to use it is to have it in shape like we have it now. But we have the best equipments. We have the hypersonic missiles that go seven times faster than the world’s current fastest missile. And these were things that should have been done before me, but they didn’t decide to do that. So it’s one of those things. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could be done. We took out 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and we killed the leader of ISIS Al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for a long time. We took out the mass murder of U.S. troops and many other people. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.

I also recognized Israeli sovereignship over the Golan Heights. They worked 52 years and we got it done in two hours, approximately. And instead of endless war in the… And when you look, this is what Chuck was just saying… What we’re doing… It’s amazing what we’re doing. We have three countries signed up. We have many… they’re all coming in. We’re forging peace in the Middle East without blood in the sand, without money, money, money that they would spend. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. Remember the party of Abraham Lincoln, the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget, but it’s the American dream.

Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world, and we will end our reliance on China. That’s already begun. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment.

We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which is so good. Starts January 1st. Lower drug prices even more. We’re going favored nations. The drug companies are not in love with me. Favored nations. We’ll be paying the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world instead of the highest drug prices of the world. But the big pharma… I don’t even want to look at Chuck and Joni, because I have no idea if they’re… You know, the biggest lobbyists in the world, right? They spend more money. I can tell you, they’re making more commercials about me than sleepy Joe is, but we had to do it. Somebody had to do it. Only a non-politician would do that. And you pay a press, but we have to do the right thing. You’ll see a 50, 60, 70% reduction in drugs.

And I got the only reduction last year. We got it down a little bit, one percent. It came down. It’s not that I’m bragging about it, but in 52 years… first time in 52 years the drug prices came down. So we’re sort of… I’m semi proud. At least it didn’t go up. I’m semi proud, but you’ll see what happens with what we’re doing with favored nations. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. It’s all done, our space center. NASA is incredible. It was a closed up, boarded up mess when we took over three and a half years ago. Now it’s, again, the envy of the world. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. Right?

And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Iowa, and Wisconsin. And Wisconsin. We didn’t forget you, because you’re going to vote us in too. We’re going to be there very soon. We love Wisconsin. Wisconsin came through for us four years ago too, and we won’t forget that. To save the America we love. Get every last person you know… Get them to the voting booth in record numbers. Vote, vote, vote.

Join the red wave. We have a giant red wave that’s formed. It’s formed. It’s formed from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, to Cedar Rapids, to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to Dubuque. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.

Proud citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help… Thank you. Your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.

We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa and Wisconsin back there, we have made America powerful again. Our military, our beautiful military. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again.

Thank you Iowa. Thank you Wisconsin. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you everybody. I hope it’s cold enough for you. Thank you everybody. Have a good time. Get out and vote.
