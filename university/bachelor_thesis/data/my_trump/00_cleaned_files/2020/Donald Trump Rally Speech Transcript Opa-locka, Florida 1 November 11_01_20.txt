Wow, what a crowd. What a crowd. Hello, Florida. Hello, Florida. We love Florida. What a great victory we had and we’re going to have an even bigger victory. Get out there and vote. We’re going to have a bigger victory. And I don’t know if you found that you’ve been here a long time. I hope the music was good. I hope life is good. Everything’s good. That’s a good looking crowd. Good looking people, I will say. No, we’re going to have a big victory. I don’t know if you know what’s happening, but…

I don’t know if you know what’s happening, but they’re very worried, the Democrats about Florida. They’re very concerned. The vote’s not there. It’s not there for them. They had to get out to that big early lead and it could be that we’re leading, that’s a little problem. Two days from now, we’re going to win, my home state of Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House.

It’s a very vital group, isn’t it? With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase, Made in the USA.

Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what’s happening. You see it happening right before your eyes. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded in the history of our country. 33.1%. 33.1%. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone. Another record, record, record, we got many records. Now we have a chance to do something next year, even greater than last year, we had it the best ever and then we got hit by the plague from China and we will never forget. We’re never going to forget it. And then we’re building it up in a level that nobody thought possible leading every nation in the world by far. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. Nothing and no one in the world is doing what we’re doing.

Now, if somebody wants to quadruple your taxes, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen. I think I can. It’s called the depression. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under sleepy Joe Biden and Obama. And if Biden and Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, most liberal member of Congress, she makes crazy Bernie look like he’s a very strict conservative, and the radical left gain power the economy will collapse and our country will go into a very deep and steep depression. I hate to tell you. Look, we’re not going to have to worry about it. If anything we’re going to win.

You know who else thinks we’re going to win? The Democrats think we’re going to win, the Democrats. They’re starting to say, “This is not good.” We’re looking great here. We’re looking great in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Iowa. Did you see the poll just came out in Iowa? First big poll? We’re only up eight. I’m very upset about that, we’re only up eight. We’re looking very strong, looking strong in Georgia. We just left the great state of Georgia. We’re looking strong in Georgia. In fact, they said, “Sir, you don’t have to go to Georgia.” They said a couple of days ago, I said, “Wait a minute, people are waiting for two and a half days. I’m not going to cancel on Georgia.” I’ve been doing this since early in the morning, only for you, I guess I could have canceled you too. Right? But nobody would have the courage to cancel you. Nah, I wouldn’t even think about it. Thank you.

Thank you. And I love you too. I love you too. We’re all in this together. We’re all in this together. Because as I’ve said many times, this will never ever, ever be a socialist nation. Sleepy Joe Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion. Can you believe it? He’s the only candidate I’ve ever seen that campaigns on the fact, “I will raise your taxes,” this guy. “I will take away your Second Amendment. We will not frack.” For two years, “We will not have frack,” then he got to Pennsylvania, he said, “Well, I was only kidding.” Look at all the press at this time. At this… Look at that them. The fake news followed us. They followed us.

The man, the man. Now, the only one I’ve ever seen do that… We don’t worry about them. They don’t tell the truth anyway so what difference. Just pretend they’re not here. Pretend they’re not here. They’re having a very bad couple of weeks as you know. They’ve actually had a bad four years when you think of it.

Massively increase regulations, we cut regulations more than any administration in the history of our country and they’ll put them right back. Sleepy Joe, it won’t be him because he has no idea where he is, but he’s surrounded by a lot of very far left people. Close down your factories, send you jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs. I say, suburban women, please love me, please love me. Got a lot of suburban women, look at this. Wow.

Don’t forget suburban women, men also, but we don’t worry about them . I’m terminating a regulation that has ruined suburbia. You too can have a project next to your house and I terminated. Oh, well we have… Is that the first sign of trouble in weeks?

All right. Is that okay? Is everybody okay over there? Is that, somebody went down or is it somebody that’s trouble? Because if there’s trouble, we have somebody right over here that can handle it very nicely. I guarantee, I bet everything in this guy right here. You know the one that make all the noises are people, somebody shouts, they have no voice, they’re week. They have no voice. Their mother’s looking for them, their father’s looking for them. They too live in a basement usually. And nobody can hear them. What they hear is thousands of people going to, “You, watch it.” That’s all right. Just pretend the person doesn’t exist or get them out please.

They want to terminate your religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare, confiscate your guns, your Second Amendment is under siege. Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, nothing’s happening. They want to ban fracking, abolish energy, cut your Medicare, cut your social security by allowing millions of people to come into our country and indoctrinate your children with anti American lies. That’s where we are but it’s not going to happen. You’re going to vote and it’s not going to happen. You know, we win Florida, we win the whole thing, you know that, right? We win Florida, we win the whole thing.

Our opponents want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela and we’re not going to let that happen. Our opponent’s agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith and a war on our police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat. I’m running as a proud American. Is that okay?

Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back. They’re all coming home, our great soldiers. We became policemen to the world. Well, for other reasons they could very well do that, couldn’t they?

Joe Biden is a corrupt politician bought and paid for by China. You see that? And others. In 2016, Florida voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Probably why we won. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody in this place, except one person, perhaps him. He’s the only one that fights harder. Great guy.

My opponent is promising a long dark winter. Did anybody happen to see the debate? See, that’s my arena. That was my arena. Right? He didn’t come out too good. He came out like your opponents come out. No, that was not good for him. How about the last question? We talked about energy, right? “Well, I’d like to transition out of petroleum.” I felt like Perry Mason. The last question of the evening, I said, “Whoa, did you tell that to Texas? Did you tell that to Pennsylvania?” Even Kristen Welker, who frankly did not a bad job considering she’s totally on the other side of the plate, she looked and she said, “Why did you say that?” She trying to save the poor guy. “This is what we got. Can you believe it. This could only happen to me.”

I don’t care. I’ll say it anyway. Look, this is in the history of presidential politics, this is the worst candidate ever to run. This puts a lot of pressure on me because if you lose to a guy like this, I’d rather really have a great candidate because you feel better. I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics.

Is there any place you would rather be than at a Trump rally? Got a lot of rich people here. My friend. You got a lot of… Oh, Steve. Hi Steve. We got a lot of rich people, a lot of money, a lot of money in this first row. A lot of money.

I built the best economy in history, and now we’re going to do it again. You know that hat. I see thousands and thousands of them. We’re getting 35, 40,000 people all the time. We’d get more, but they don’t have any more room. How about this? You take an airport, right? You take an airport, you don’t have enough room. Did you ever think of that one? We have an airport. We don’t have enough room. This is amazing. There’s never been anything like this has ever happened in the history of politics. Probably on any other history and I don’t have a guitar. You know the truth is… No, it’s true. They don’t get crowds like this. Nobody gets crowds like this. You know what gets crowds like this? Making America Great Again. That’s what it does. It’s the only thing that’s going to get a crows like this.

Sleepy Joe had a rally today, they had 12 people in those little circles. It’s got those little crazy circles. It’s the only thing good about his campaign, the guy that does the work, I’m a perfectionist, they’re so beautiful, nice and wide. And they can’t fill them up so they get the media, “Could you please take a circle?”

So they get the media. Could you please take a circle? And now he’s got President Barack Hussein Obama comes in. President Obama.

You know, the Democrats never talk about it. You know that federal judgeships are like the biggest deal, and then you have Supreme Court justices. Barack Obama left me 142 federal judges. Nothing like that’s ever happened, nothing. Very rarely does it … You know, when you’re a president, every one … You leave; every one of them is filled. Those are the most important things you can have. Federal judgeships, lifetime appointments. It’s such a big deal. He left me 142, and we are going to have … Listen to this. We are going to have, in my first term, record-breaking, approximately 300 federal judges. It’s a very big percentage of the whole federal bench. And we are going to have … We just put a great one on: Amy. Three Supreme court justices.

And whatever happened with Biden? He was going to say … Is he going to pack the court? He just keeps tapping. Maybe he’s smarter than we think. Keeps tapping it along. And who are the people he’s going to put on? He was supposed to say who he’s … You cannot vote for him if he doesn’t tell you about packing the court. Therefore is anybody in this audience going to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden?

I can’t imagine anyone having the courage. I can’t believe it. Look at those people. They go … Does anybody have the courage to even raise your hand? That wouldn’t be a very good thing to do. Who is going to vote on election day for President Trump?

Who has already voted?

Has anybody here … Seriously, we don’t mind. Not going to matter. Not going to matter. Has anybody voted? With all those people that have already voted, we have a lot of votes going out, and I think we’re leading. Can you believe? In early voting. Has any … Oh, that’s a shock. Oh, that’s the big story. They’re saying we have to get more people out. We have … Maybe I shouldn’t say that. People are watching. No, we’re doing good. No, but anybody here vote for Sleepy Joe Biden?

Okay, good. I believe you. I believe you. This election is a choice between a crippling depression or a historic boom. It is. You have a depression. All that money, all those 401Ks, they’re got to go right down the tubes. Throw it out. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to lock down the country.

I just left the country … I just left a state that locked down. I left two of them, and they’re not happy about it. I’ll tell you right now. You know what’s going to happen to them? On November 4th, the day after, they’re going to say, “All right, we’ll open up now.” That’s why they’re locking down. But we’re going to have a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic. Without it, it’s rounding the … I say it. It drives them crazy. It’s rounding the turn, because all they want to do … You turn on the news: COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. We’d like to talk about COVID, and then the next time, here’s what happens. November 4th, you won’t hear too much about it. You won’t hear too much about it.

Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it. No, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man, though. He’s been wrong on a lot. “Do not, under any circumstances, wear a mask,” he said. “Do not close up to China,” he said. Then he said later on that President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives because I closed early. But how about this? How about Sleepy Joe? I close and he calls me xenophobic. I said, “Give me a definition of that, Joe. Give me a definition.” He didn’t know how. He had no idea what it meant.

You know, 25 years ago, he was not smart. He was never considered smart, and now he’s considered about half of that. This is not what you want for your president. We’re doing too well. Our country’s doing too well. We will mass-distribute the vaccine in just a few weeks. We have all the vaccines. It’s all set. Our military is going to deliver. They’re going to take care of our seniors first. Is it okay if we take care of our seniors first?

You know, I got it. I knew you didn’t hear this story, but I got it, because I got better quickly, but I got it. The First Lady got it, and a very young, tall person, 14 years old, named Barron Trump, got it. And I got better. They gave me something called Regeneron, but I’m sure I didn’t need it, because I am a perfect physical specimen and I’m very young. I’m very young. Perfect physical specimen. You know, I said that a little sarcastically, and I said … Although I actually think I am. No, I’m only kidding. No, I said that sarcastically. CNN, right over there with the red light, just went off. Any time I mention them, that light goes off. We have to cut to a commercial. You know, in one way, they need the ratings because they don’t get good ratings.

No, they hated it when I said it. They said, “He is not a perfect physical specimen. It’s a disgrace. He’s lying to the American public, and he is not young. He is not young.” They went crazy. They went totally crazy. They went crazy. They spent two days on that one.

Joe Biden, well, he’s very threatening all the time. He’s so agitated. Did you see him today with the glasses, the whole deal? But you don’t see the bad surgery. I put on those … What do they call them? Aviators? But they’re too small. They got to be bigger, right? They’re mirrored. You don’t see anything going through it. No, he’s very agitated, so angry. Everything’s screaming and shouting. It’s like crazy. But he’s a weak person. You know, he challenged me. Do you remember? A year-and-a-half ago? “Oh, I’d like to take him behind the barn.” And I said, “You know … ” I said, “Of all the people in the world that I could fight, that’s probably the one I’d like to most fight.”

Those legs have gotten very thin, not a lot of base. You wouldn’t have to close the fist. And by the way, he brings it up. You know, when he brings it up, the press says nothing. If I ever said, “I’d like to take him behind the barn and beat the crap out of him,” you know what? They would say, “Our president is inciting evil.” I’m inciting. Every time you shout, “Lock him up,” or every time … Did you see the cars today? All over the place. Cars, trucks, and boats, all organic. They just formed, 5,000 boats. They have tractors in Iowa, thousands and thousands of tractors in this massive farm. They came from all over farm country. They had the thing with these … Really, I’d say very good people.

They were riding along the highway, and you had Sleepy Joe’s bus. So they escorted the bus, and the radical left said, “Oh, what a horrible thing that is to escort the bus.” They don’t tell you about Antifa that go around burning down your cities. Democrat-run, only Democrat-run.

They don’t talk about that, bopping people over the head, killing people, setting everything on fire. They don’t tell you about that. They tell you about people that are driving down a highway with an American flag and a Trump flag. Don’t worry; they’ll be just fine. They are going to be just fine. If they’re watching, I guess they were in Texas, right? Oh, Texas will be just fine. We’re doing great in Texas, by the way, really good. You know how? Is this the greatest? You know, I’ve had really six of these, because I had them here, but let’s say five, okay? Do you know what it is to do five of these? I start early in the morning. No, think of it. Start early in the morning, but you know what’s the nice part about this one? This is the last one of the day, so we can stay all night.

All night. I was rushing. I was rushing. They said, “You’re going to be late for Florida, Sir.” I said, “How much?” “About an hour-and-a-half.” “Oh, that’s not so bad.” I hope everyone’s having… You know how many people we lost? I’d say zero. We actually gained. People heard about it. They said, “Let’s go.” No, it’s great to be with you. It’s great. Tomorrow, I have five more. Can you imagine five? Five. Five more, and then normally, they’d say, “Five more and let’s crash,” but I don’t know if I can crash. I think it’s going to be a very exciting day. Tuesday is going to be a very exciting day. Make sure you get out. Tuesday is going to be a very exciting day. The most exciting day in the history of television was four years ago, right?

Thank you. No, but it is nice that we can take our time. I can tell you stories about some of the things that happen in government. You don’t want to hear them. You wouldn’t even believe them, the level of stupidity, the things that we saved. Like we saved a couple of billion dollars on the embassy in Israel. We built it for slightly less. We built it for slightly less. First, I picked the site that we already owned. You know, that’s better than paying millions for a site, but I picked one that was a better location, bigger, better. Then they were going to build the building for anywhere between one billion and two. This is like a two-storey building, right? One billion and 2 billion, and we built it for $500,000, a slight saving.

We had an existing building that we fixed up. We used Jerusalem stone, very expensive when you bring it to New York or Washington. But when you’re building in Jerusalem, it’s a very cheap material. I said, “Use Jerusalem stone. It’s great stuff.” And we opened it for $500,000, instead of two billion dollars. That’s one of many. We could tell you about them all night, but let’s get back to the point.

Isn’t it nice when you have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? You have a president … It is a nice thing. I had a couple today, though. It was so windy. It was so unbelievable windy, you wouldn’t have believed that the teleprompters were going like this. And then I finally gave up on the teleprompter, so we just talked for an hour and 20 minutes. I said, “This is not possible to read those things, going, “Wah.” You know, the winds were like 30 to 40. The press knows. They couldn’t hold onto the camera. That was a positive event. They know. They never saw. It was probably minus something, if you talk about wind chill. I think it was 30 degrees with a 30-mile-an-hour wind, and it was blowing right in my face. These people that set this up …

It was blowing so hard, and I had a whole section on illegal immigrants pouring into our country, and I left it out, because I said, “If they would have had to suffer the cold weather that I was, they would never come in. They would have stayed. They would have stayed right where they came from.” They had some rough … We had three. The first three were freezing. So I go from freezing, and today was like 98 degrees. I said, “How warm is it?” “Sir, it’s about 97 degrees.” This is wonderful for not catching pneumonia.

Biden’s cruel lockdown would be especially devastating for Florida’s tourism and hospitality workers, for the services industry, and for millions of Latinos in Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, and all across the country. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you have no choice but to cast your vote for a person named President Trump. It’s very true.

But I don’t have to talk too much about Sleepy Joe, because I spent a fortune today to give you a beautiful … Look at the size of that screen that we put up. Where do you have two? You have two of them. This must be Florida. Look at that. You have two of them. Take a look. Here’s a video. Roll it.

Thank you. I don’t even have to say … I could say, goodnight, everybody. That can not be your president. The Biden lockdown would cripple Florida. My plan will lift Florida to record highs, we’ve already been doing it. So joining us tonight, we have some wonderful people. You have a wonderful, great governor, loves your state and loves our country. Governor Ron DeSantis, Ron? A man who’s become a really good friend of mine. We went to war and he’s a tough guy, he’s a smart guy. But he really he’s doing a fantastic job for you and for everybody, Senator Marco Rubio.

Good to see you, Marco. You have great senators. This is one that happened to be your governor also. And Ron would be the first one to say it, Rick Scott did a great job as governor doing a great job as your Senator, Rick Scott. Where is Rick? Thank you, Rick.

And a great job on television today, Jeanette Nunez. Thank you very much, Jeanette. Wow, what a good job you did. What a job you did representing your state and said nice things about a lot of people. The only one I really cared about was me. So I was very happy. It did a great job today. Thank you very much, Jeanette.

Chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, Jimmy. Great. Doing great, Jimmy. And we have some warriors with us, real warriors, Mario Diaz Balart, Congressman. Thank you Mario. Fantastic job. Fantastic job. He’s become a friend of mine. He had the China plague and he got better pretty quick, right? Got better quick. And now he’s immune. Until I came along, they said, “If you’re immune you’re immune for life, everybody’s immune.” When I got it, I said I was immune. They said, “Yeah, but it’s only for four months now.” Mario, they only now give us four months, okay? What a terrible thing. I’m sorry I did that to all of those people.

And another warrior, tough guy, smart guy. And really my friend, Brian Mast. Thank you, Brian. Congressional candidates, they’re fantastic. Byron Donalds. Where is Byron? You are doing great, Byron. You are doing great. Good job. Fantastic job. And another man, I’ve known him for a long time, he’s terrific. He’s going to win he’s up in the polls by the way, Carlos Jiminez. Where is he? Carlos. Thank you, Carlos. Good job.

And the next mayor of Miami Dade County, Steve Bovo. Hey, you’re a popular guy, Steve. You’re a popular guy.

Former attorney general and a fantastic talent and my friend for a long time. Oh, we’re going to look for something for her. She had to go out and make a couple of bucks and I’m sure she’s doing great. She’s always done great, and she was an incredible representative of your state, a very special woman, Pam Bondi. Pam, great. You’re doing a great job. Great person. Another great person. She was so tough in California. She was the DA, right? The DA. And she was brutal. I think she’s like 471 to nothing. You never wanted to get in trouble with this one. And she’s a very special person to me and to my family. Kimberly Guilfoyle And I have respect for champions. There’s a reason you’re a champion. And whether it’s Jack Nicklaus, who gave us a beautiful endorsement the other day. So many champions, right? Actually, not too many champions. Usually they tend to choke in the end. In the end, they’re not champions, but we have one of the greatest fighters anywhere in the world. In fact, I was willing before, when there was a little trouble back there, I was willing to pit whoever that poor person was against the greatest fighter, Jorge Masvidal. The greatest.

I went to a UFC fight. I went to a UFC fight and this gentleman, and he is a gentleman. Great guy, actually, hard to believe. How the hell are you such a nice guy? I have a feeling I don’t know. He was fighting a young superstar, right? He was a young, handsome guy. Really good looking guy. Maybe that was the problem with him, he looked too good. And I was Dana White, the great Dana White. You know who Dana White is, what a job. And he said, “Let me tell you something, Jorge has been around for a little while.” He’s won most of his fights. I hear he’s got a very big one coming up. I’ll be watching that one. I’m going to be watching it, he’s a fantastic talent.

He fought as a very young guy. Used to fight at eight years old, had beat up people that are 16 and 17. And then one day they said, “Let’s take this guy to the gym.” And you know what? He beat up all these guys in the gym. And he’s a total champion. He’s a total champion, and I do want to take that bet. Is that person still here? No, he went back home to mom? Went back home to mom. But we had this young, handsome, really, he looked like a male model. And Dana white said to me, “This is the future of the UFC. Watch how great he is. He’s tremendous.” And wasn’t he like 12 and 0, and he walked in the ring and he was full of stuff. And this guy walks in and the fight lasted. What was it? One and a half seconds, I think. Five seconds. It was the quickest knockout in the history of the UFC.

No, it was like, ding. He runs across the ring, kicks the hell out of him, right in the face. And I looked at Dana. I said, “Dana, what happened? What happened?” He’s a great fighter. And he’s a great guy. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Champ, he’s a champ. He’s got that heart. He’s got that heart. Thank you, man. We need more people like him, I can tell you. We need people like him in our government that have guts and courage and smarts too.

For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars, rebuilding foreign nations, fighting ridiculous foreign wars and defending our foreign borders that we didn’t defend our own borders. But now we do. And now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. It’s enough.

For 47 years. Sleepy, Joe Biden, betrayed Hispanic Americans. I’m not going to let you meet him, champ, you may get angry. That’d be one 10th of one second. Now he wants to close your small businesses, eliminate school choice and attack our Hispanic law enforcement heroes at the border, you know that. The radical left will assault Catholic organizations, ban prayer in school and fund extreme late term abortion. I will always stand with the incredible Hispanic American community, you know that.

Well, that’s one of the things that’s going wrong with the vote. I’ll tell you. You’ve been here so long that some of you have been here since like yesterday. I know you’ve been on line. But you’ve been here a long time, but I’ll tell you, so one of the problems with Florida for the other side for sleepy, Joe and the Democrats is that they say, “What happened? The Hispanic Americans are not voting. They’re not coming out for sleepy Joe?” Who the hell can vote for this guy? They’re saying that’s one, right? The other one is the black community. What’s going on? They’re voting for Trump. They’re voting for Trump. Look at you. They’re voting for Trump.

They’re voting for Trump. Did you see it, 18%? The old days, they’d get 4%. You want 4%, you needed 4%. 18 or 19%, I think it’s going up to 20%, whatever it is, it’s about three times what anyone’s gotten. Thank you very much. Thank you to the black community. Thank you to the Hispanic community. And we’re returning the pharmaceutical industry back to Puerto Rico. Biden is the one that took it out. So I don’t know if we have anybody from Puerto Rico. Do we have Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico? Yes. We’re bringing those jobs back. That was Biden. Oh, that’s right. Oh yes. We’re bringing the pharmaceutical industry back. It was doing great and then Biden and his group of clowns, they didn’t know what the hell they were doing. They moved it. You know where it moved to? China. We’re bringing it all back.

Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in the history of the United States. And the wall right now, it’s over 400 miles. It’ll be finished very shortly. And it’s everything that the border patrol, I listened to them. They wanted steel, concrete, and rebar. I said, “What about just concrete plank?” “Sir, we want it this way.” I said, “Okay, I’ll do it.” I don’t want to give them any excuses. But it’s incredible what’s happened with that and we have the most secure border we’ve ever had. And by the way, we want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in on merit and we want them to come in legally and that’s what happens. That’s what we’re doing. We want them to come in. We need people to come in because of the jobs, we need people. The Biden Kamala plan. How about when she introduced herself? And they said the Harris, the Harris-Biden administration, and then Joe Biden said the same thing two hours later. He said, “Under the Harris-Biden administration.” This is twice in one day.

I love Mike Pence. I think he’s great, don’t we? But I have a deal with Mike. I said, “Mike, I will never say it’s the Pence-Trump administration.” But Mike has done a great job. He’s done a great job. He’s done a great job with NASA. NASA, the space center, we have done a great job with that. Mike has led it. The Biden- Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist regions by a staggering 700%, including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. And I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists out of our country, if you don’t mind.

We’re keeping them the hell out. If you don’t mind, if Florida doesn’t mind, we will. I put a ban on, everyone told me what a horrible thing to do. Ask France, whether or not that would be a good thing for them. Have you seen what’s happened in France over the last week? No, thank you. We want people to come into our country who love our country.

For instance, we’re going to win Minnesota. You know one of the reasons why? Ilhan Omar, She loves our country very much. She loves our country. It’s unbelievable. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. She loves us very much. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, the most ever. And you know what? I said, we got to break the budget for this one, because all built in the USA. We have the best missiles, the best rockets, the best fighter jets, have 35, submarines, nobody even close to us, we have submarine technology that nobody’s even close. We have things that nobody, we are the envy of the world militarily. And when I took it over, it was a depleted, broken military. One of the most overrated generals anywhere in the history of this country came up to me and said, sir, we have no ammunition. This was my first week in office. I was getting a little bit frisky with a certain country. You know that right? You all know about it. And he came and he said, sir, we have no ammunition. I became much less frisky with that contract. I said, it will have to wait.

Now we have so much ammunition, we don’t know what the hell to do with it, okay. We also passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great vets. Right? Right? Yeah. They said it couldn’t be done. Just got a 91% approval rating from our vets, the highest by far that we’ve ever had. At my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage kidnapped overseas just 96 hours ago. Last night… He was kidnapped 96 hours ago, we went in last night, the US special forces, brilliantly executed a daring, nighttime operation.  They wanted to do it so badly. .

They kidnap this young, in a far away land. They kidnap this young American, kidnapped him and they were negotiating for a, they wanted money. Once you give money, once you do that, you’ll have it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. So we had some people that are the best in the world. These are the best fighters in the world, except for him, maybe. I don’t know, different kind of fighting, right? Different, different kind of fighting right? But these are the best in the world. Incredible people, smart, brilliant in so many ways, and great. They wanted to do it. I said, do they want to do it? You couldn’t hold them back.

And they went in there and they went in by night and it was over very quickly. And we didn’t have anybody even injured slightly. We got the hostage and unfortunately they are gone. They are gone. Now, if you pay them, they’ll be doing just over and over. So I’d like, it would be wonderful, let’s say, but once you do that, even if it was a small amount, it’s no good. And they didn’t want a small amount. They wanted a lot of money. Over the last four years, we’ve rescued a record 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries. And some of them were very tough countries, but we were able to get them out. That’s a lot. That’s a record too. And what do we have?

Robert O’Brien, is he around here? He’s fantastic. Where’s Robert? Where is Robert? He is so good. What happened to him? He’s out negotiating a hostage deal. That’s all he does. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Robert, look at him. I’ll tell you. He’s a little, he’s a little tired. This is his fifth rally today too. He’s fantastic. He’s fantastic. What a job he does. Thank you, Robert. Great job too. Congratulations. That was brave. I said, Robert, do you want to do it? It was like, yes before I finished the question. You want to do it, Robert? Yes. So anyway, good job. Thank you very much.

The operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try to kidnap our people. You cannot escape the long reach of our American military or American justice. You can’t do it. We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and it was a mess. Let me tell you, when I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. It’s gone, 100%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for 14, first day in office, I said to our people, great people. I said, where’s al-Baghdadi? That’s all I heard about, al-Bag, every time I’d say where’s al-Baghdadi. And one day they came in, they said, we have him, sir, what do you want us to do? I said, I’ll tell you what, let’s go. And we got a bad, bad guy, founded ISIS. And he was trying to rebuild it again. We eliminated the mass murderer of us troops, and many troops and many people. Soleimani is dead.

I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. Iran is not doing well. They had a 27% GDP decline. It was like the opposite with all the sanctions. I’ll tell you the first call I get, if we win, we got to win. First call I get will be from the Supreme Leader, as he calls himself, the Supreme Leader. I refuse to call him the Supreme Leader, but he calls himself the Supreme Leader. The first call will be from the Supreme Leader. And you know what? I’d love to make a deal with him. You know why? We don’t want to do anything bad, but we just can’t let them have a nuclear weapon, if that’s okay. Can’t let them have.

Obama paid him $150 billion, 150 billion, 150 million would be a lot, but 150 billion. It’s not even, it’s not even conceived. This is people that don’t have any clue about life. Gave him 1.8 billion in cash, in green. Can you believe it? Cash. Five plane loads, big planes. Exactly, where is that beautiful plane that we came in? Where the hell is it? Oops. Somebody stole Air Force One. Planes like that. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they’ve been negotiating. People would fly in, fly out, fly in, fly out, have dinner, have lunch, fly in, fly out. 52 years. I did it in two hours, a little bit less.

And instead of endless war, we are now forging peace in the Middle East. We have the countries aligned, . No blood in the sand, no costs, no nothing. They want, you know what? After all these years, frankly, we just said, what did Obama do? And I heard, and you know what I did? I did the opposite. I said, what did Obama do? And then I did the opposite, and it worked. Biden and Barack Hussein Obama made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro regime on Cuba. That was the other thing I did. I said, who made the deal? Obama. I said, we’re going to go the exact opposite way. Okay. We only have a 96% approval rating with Cuban Americans, 96. 96%. Who the hell are the 4%? Champ, who are the 4%?

Now the Biden campaign has said that they will work closely with socialistic dictator Maduro in Venezuela. Not the way you do it. My opponent embraces socialists and communists because he has no choice, because that’s who he’s dealing with in government. I stand with the proud people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom. And we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me is, we are making, by the way, we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me in the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, it’s already started. We will expand opportunity zones, increase vocational education, and provide school choice to every family in America. We will hire more police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment. . We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we’re doing. We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency, lower drug prices to the lowest levels they’ve ever gone. And we will always protect patients with pre existing condition. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust.

For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great, incredible, wonderful people of Florida. You better vote, vote, vote, vote. Two days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. And as I said, we win Florida. We win it all. Your vote can defeat the Washington swamp. We’ve done a good job of it, but it’s deeper and more vicious than we ever thought. And the corrupt media right there, once and for all. So you must get out and vote. We have never had in the history of our country, I really believe this, a more important election. We will never, ever be,  wants to start a conversation with me. Can you believe? That’s okay, darling. Yes?

Oh, good. Joan Miller from the Brooklyn Club. Hi, Joan. Joan, let me finish up. Joan, thank you very much. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Orlando to Jacksonville, and from Pensacola to Miami, we inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.

Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, wealthy, wealthy, wealthy. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Go out and vote. Thank you.
