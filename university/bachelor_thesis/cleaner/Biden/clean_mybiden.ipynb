      "\n",
      "Inhalt: \n",
      "Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. If I were smart, I’d go home now. Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans, in January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation and he said, “I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.” Hitler was on the march, war was raging in Europe, President Roosevelt’s purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time. Freedom and democracy we’re under assault in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I come to this same chamber to address the nation. Now, it’s we who face unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. And yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln in the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today. What makes our moment rare is the freedom and democracy are under attack at both at home and overseas at the very same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not. But Ukraine, Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all. That is all Ukraine is asking. They’re not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers in the war in Ukraine and I’m determined to keep it that way. But now, assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership. I wasn’t a long ago when a Republican president named Ronald Reagan thundered, “Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, “Do whatever the hell you want.” That’s a quote. A former president actually said that bowing down to a Russian leader, I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous, and it’s unacceptable. America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of Democratic nations created after World War II to prevent world war and keep the peace. And today, we’ve made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year. And just this morning, Sweden officially joined and their minister is here tonight. Stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight. Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen. I say this to Congress, we have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm. My message to President Putin who I’ve known for a long time is simple, “We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.” In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when insurrectionists stormed this very Capital and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots. They’ve come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people. January 6th and lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed the gravest threat to US democracy since the Civil War. But they failed, America stood. America stood strong and democracy prevailed. We must be honest, the threat to democracy must be defended. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. I will not do that. This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here’s the simple truth: you can’t love your country only when you win. As I’ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember, your oath of office is defending against all threats, foreign and domestic. Respect, respect free and fair elections. Restore trust in our institutions and make clear, political violence has absolutely no place, no place in America, zero place. Again, it’s not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. We’re watching it. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do. History is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait. What her family had got through should never have happened. Unless Congress acts, it could happen again. So tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle, don’t keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom, and so much more. Thank you. My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He’s the reason it was overturned and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted. Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She’s become pregnant again and had a fetus of a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed. What her family got through should have never happened as well but it’s happening in to many others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are state laws banning the freedom to choose. Criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need. Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. My god, what freedoms would you take away? Look, in its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following, and with all due respect, justices, “Women are not without electoral or political power.” You’re about to realize just how much you can brag about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2020 and we win again in 2024. If you, the American people, send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I’ll restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. Folks, America cannot go back. I’m here tonight to show what I believe the way forward because I know how far we’ve come. Four years ago, next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in the century.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the fear? Record losses? Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate, raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind, a mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness? A president, my predecessor, failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care. I think that’s unforgivable. I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation’s history we have. It doesn’t make news but in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So let’s tell the story here, tell it here and now. America’s comeback is building the future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Investing in all America and all Americans to make every sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind. The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback, that’s what America does. That’s what America does.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, my inherited economy is on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world. 15 million new jobs in just three years, a record. Unemployment, at 50-year low. A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is a literal act of hope with historic job growth and small business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian-Americans. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. Where is it written we can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are and we will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More people have health insurance today than ever before. The racial wealth gap is as small as it’s been in 20 years. Wages keep going up, inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3%, the lowest in the world and tending lower. The landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs right here in America where they belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And it takes time but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring. Buy America, has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor, including some Democrats as well in the past, failed to buy American. Not anymore. On my watch, federal projects that you fund, like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways will be made with American products and built by American workers. Good paying American jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And thanks to our Chips and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cellphones to automobiles. And by the way, we invented those chips right here in America. Well, instead of having to import them, instead, private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs. Many of those jobs paying a $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America. And thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law, 46,000 new projects have announced all across your communities. And by the way, I noticed some of you strongly voted against it or they’re cheering on that money coming in. I like it. I’m with you. I’m with you. If any of you don’t want that money in your district, just let me know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Modernize that roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems. Removing poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage. Providing affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where you live: urban, suburban, or rural communities, in red states and blue states. Record investments in tribal communities. Because I invested in the family farm, led by my Secretary of Agriculture who knows more about this than anybody I know, we’re better able to stay in the family farms and their children or grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living. It’s transformative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois, home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading. Then, I was elected to the office and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded. Instead of auto factory shutting down, auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power of those cars there at the same… To the folks at Belvidere, I say, “Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building the future in Belvidere right here in America.” Here tonight, the UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up. And Dawn Sim, a third generation UAW worker at Belvidere. Shawn, I was proud to be the first president to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well. Showing once again, Wall Street didn’t build America. They’re not bad guys, they didn’t build it though. The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class. I say to the American people, when America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That’s America. That’s you, the American people. It’s because of you America is coming back. It’s because of you our future is bright. It’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say, “The state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.” Tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get all the tax breaks. And by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a state that has more corporations invested than every one of your states in the United States combined and I represented it for 36 years. I’m not anti-corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn’t put much on my dad’s kitchen table, that’s why I’m determined to turn things around so middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. And there’s more to do to make sure you’re feeling the benefits of all we’re doing. Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It’s wrong and I’m ending it. With a law that I proposed and signed, and not one of your Republican buddies voted for it, we finally beat big pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin, with diabetes, and it only costs 10 bucks to make, they only get paid 35 a month now and still make healthy profit. And I want a… What to do next? I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone. For years, people have talked about it, but finally we got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs, just like the VA is able to do for veterans. That’s not just saving seniors money, it’s saving taxpayers money. We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to big pharma.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. It’s now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.They’re making a lot of money, guys, and they’ll still be extremely profitable. Will not only save lives, it will save taxpayers another $200 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting next year that same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $15,000 a year. Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone. Folks, I’m going to get in trouble for saying that, but, Berlin, Moscow … Excuse me, well, even Moscow, probably. Bring your prescription with you and I promise you I’ll get it for you for 40% the cost you’re paying now. Same company, same drug, same place. Folks, the Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare, it’s still a very big deal. Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing condition, but my predecessor, and many in this chamber, want to take that protection drug away by repealing the Affordable Care Act. I’m not going to let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped you 50 times before and we will stop you again. In fact, I’m not only protecting it, I’m expanding it. The enacted tax credits save $800 per person per year, reduced health care cost for millions of working families. That tax credit expire next year. I want to make that savings permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To state the obvious, women are more than half our population, but research on women’s health has always been underfunded. That’s why we’re launching the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, led by Jill, doing an incredible job as First Lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pass my plan for $12 billion to transform women’s health research and benefit millions of lives all across America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the cost of housing is so important to you. Inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that, but I’m not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Just for two years. My administration is also eliminating title insurance on federally-backed mortgages. When you refinance your home you can save you $1,000 or more as a consequence.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve cut red tape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million housing units nationwide. Now pass and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down. To remain the strongest economy in the world we need to have the best education system in the world. I, like I suspect all of you, want to give a child, every child, a good start by providing access to preschool for 3 and 4-years-old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there’s no books, they’re not read to, not spoken to very often start school, kindergarten or first grade, hearing, having heard a million fewer words spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school, go on to earn a 2 and 4 year degree no matter what their background is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the business roundtable. They were mad that I … They were angry … Well, they were discussing why I wanted to spend money on education. I pointed out to them as vice president I met with over … I think it was 182 of those folks, don’t hold me to the exact number. I asked them what they need most, the CEOs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ve had the same experience on both sides of the aisle. They say a better educated workforce, right? I looked at them, I say, “I come from Delaware. DuPont used to be the eighth-largest corporation in the world, and every new enterprise they bought they educated the workforce to that enterprise, but none of you do that anymore. Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated workforce in the world?” They all looked at me and said, “I think you’re right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade. I’m also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college, and I want to make sure that college more affordable.\n",

      "\n",
      "When I was told I couldn’t universally just change the way in which we dealt with student loans, I fixed two student loans programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including nurses, firefighters, and others in public service, like Keenan Jones a public-school educator from Minnesota who’s here with us tonight. Keenan, where are you? Keenan, thank you.\n",

      "Folks, look, such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home, start a business, start a family. While we’re at it, I want public school teachers a raise. By the way, the first couple of years we cut the deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans. I’ve been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways. We’ve already cut the federal deficit by over a trillion dollars. I signed the bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s my goal to cut the federal deficit $3 trillion by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share. Look, I’m a capitalist. If you want to make a million or million of bucks, that’s great, just pay your fair share in taxes. A fair tax code is how we invest things that make this country great: health care, education, defense, and more, but here’s the deal, the last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, overwhelmingly benefit the topping 1%, the very wealthy, the biggest corporation, and exploded the federal deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history. Check the numbers. Folks at home, does anybody really think the tax code is fair? Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break? I sure don’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes. Nobody. Not one penny, and they haven’t yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the Child Tax Credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half. Restore the Child Tax Credit. No child should go hungry in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their share. Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in federal income taxes. Zero. Not any more. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s still less than working people pay in federal taxes. It’s time to raise corporate minimum tax to at least 21% so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to end tax breaks for big pharma, big oil, private, massive executive pay when deducted. They can pay $10 million if they want, but deduct a million. End it now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what the average federal tax rate for these billionaires? No, they’re making great sacrifices, 8.2%. That’s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I propose a minimum tax for billionaires of 25%. Just 25%. You know what that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years. Imagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable childcare, millions of families can get … They need to go to work to help grow the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a future with paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member.

      "Tonight, let’s all agree once again to stand up for seniors. Many of my friends on the other side of aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block. If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It’s not fair. We have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. I will … That’s the proposal. Oh, no. You guys don’t want another $2 trillion tax cut? I kind of thought that’s what your plan was. Well, that’s good to hear you’re not going to cut another $2 trillion for the super wealthy. That’s good to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share. Look, too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less.\n",

      "\n",
      "That’s why we’re cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing, from food to health care to housing. In fact, the snack companies think you won’t notice if they charge the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer … Same size bag, put fewer chips in it. No, I’m not joking.

Pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Right Act. And stop denying another core value of America, our diversity across American life. Banning books, it’s wrong. Instead of erasing history, let’s make history. I want to protect fundamental rights. Pass the Equality Act. Am I missing the transgender American? I have your back.

I’m cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030, creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs like the IBEW work is building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. Conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030 and taking action on environmental justice. Fence-lined communities smothered by the legacy of pollution.

It was then through my American Rescue Plan, which every Republican voted against, I might add, we made the largest investment in public safety ever. Last year, the murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years, but we have more to do. We have to help cities invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, more community violence intervention. Give communities the tool to crack down on gun crime, retail crime and carjacking. Keep building trust as I’ve been doing by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land.

Very soon after that happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde for a couple days. We spent hours and hours with each of the families. We heard their message so everyone in this room, in this chamber could hear the same message, the constant refrain. And I was there for hours meeting with every family. They said, “Do something.

I’m proud we beat the NRA when I signed most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress. We now must beat the NRA again.

This crisis began on October 7th with a massacre by a terrorist group called Hamas as you all know. 1,200 innocent people, women and girls, men and boys, slaughtered after enduring sexual violence. The deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust and 250 hostages taken. Here in this chamber tonight are families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas. I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home.

But Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards under hospitals, daycare centers and all the like. Israel also has a fundamental responsibility though to protect innocent civilians in Gaza. This war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom are not Hamas. Thousands and thousands of innocent women and children, girls and boys also orphaned. Nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displacement. Homes destroyed, neighbors in rubble, cities in ruin, families without food, water, medicine. It’s heartbreaking.\n",

The United States have been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Tonight, I’m directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. No US boots will be on the ground. A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting in Gaza every day. And Israel must do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the crossfire. They’re announcing they’re going to have a crossing in Northern Gaza.\n",

As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time. And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career. No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do. I challenge any of you here. I’m the only American president of Israel in wartime, but there is no other path that guarantees Israel’s security and democracy. There is no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with peace and dignity.

As commander in chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel. For years, I’ve heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise, and America is falling behind. They’ve got it backwards. I’ve been saying it for over four years, even when I wasn’t president. America is rising. We have the best economy in the world, and since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade.

And we’re in a stronger position to win the conflict of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter, than any time as well. Here at home, I’ve signed over 400 bipartisan bills.

When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story. Again and again, I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that defined America. Honesty, decency, dignity, equality, to respect everyone, to give everyone a fair chance, to give hate no safe harbor. Now other people my age see it differently. The American story of resentment, revenge and retribution, that’s not me. I was born amid World War II when America stood for the freedom of the world.

Now a president to the first woman vice president. In my career, I’ve been told I was too young. By the way, they can let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes. Not a joke.

America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of Democratic nations created after World War II to prevent world war and keep the peace. And today, we’ve made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year. And just this morning, Sweden officially joined and their minister is here tonight. Stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome.

The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm. My message to President Putin who I’ve known for a long time is simple, “We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.” In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when insurrectionists stormed this very Capital and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.\n",

January 6th and lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed the gravest threat to US democracy since the Civil War. But they failed, America stood. America stood strong and democracy prevailed. We must be honest, the threat to democracy must be defended. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. I will not do that. This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here’s the simple truth: you can’t love your country only when you win. As I’ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember, your oath of office is defending against all threats, foreign and domestic. Respect, respect free and fair elections.

Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act.

Investing in all America and all Americans to make every sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind. The pandemic no longer controls our lives.

Tonight, I’m directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. No US boots will be on the ground. A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting in Gaza every day. And Israel must do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the crossfire. They’re announcing they’re going to have a crossing in Northern Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To the leadership of Israel, I say this, humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority. As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time. And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career. No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do. I challenge any of you here. I’m the only American president of Israel in wartime, but there is no other path that guarantees Israel’s security and democracy. There is no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with peace and dignity. And there’s no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia with whom I’m talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran. That’s why I build a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. I’ve ordered strikes to degrade the Houthis capability and defend US forces in the region. As commander in chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel. For years, I’ve heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise, and America is falling behind. They’ve got it backwards. I’ve been saying it for over four years, even when I wasn’t president. America is rising. We have the best economy in the world, and since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade. And we’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I revitalized our partnership and alliance in the Pacific. India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Pacific Islands. I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China, not allowing to trade them there. Frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that. I want competition with China, not conflict. And we’re in a stronger position to win the conflict of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter, than any time as well. Here at home, I’ve signed over 400 bipartisan bills. There’s more to pass my unity agenda. Strength and penalties on fentanyl trafficking. You don’t want to do that, huh? Pass bipartisan privacy that says to protect our children online, harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril, ban AI voice impersonations and more. And keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the strong support and help of Denis and the VA, I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever helping millions of veterans exposed to a toxin who now are battling more than 100 different cases. Many of them don’t come home, but we owe them and their families support. We owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H and remind us that we can do big things like end cancer as we know it, and we will. Let me close with this. I know you don’t want to hear any more, Lindsay, but I got to say a few more things. I know it may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while. When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story. Again and again, I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that defined America. Honesty, decency, dignity, equality, to respect everyone, to give everyone a fair chance, to give hate no safe harbor. Now other people my age see it differently. The American story of resentment, revenge and retribution, that’s not me. I was born amid World War II when America stood for the freedom of the world. I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware among working class people who built this country.\n",

      "I watched in horror as two of my heroes, like many of you did, Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. And their legacy inspired me to pursue a career in service. I left the law firm, became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots. And I became a county councilman almost by accident. I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running at age 29. Then vice president of our first black president. Now a president to the first woman vice president. In my career, I’ve been told I was too young. By the way, they can let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes. Not a joke. And I’ve been told I’m too old. Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures. I’ve known our North Star.\n",

      "\n",
      "The very idea of America that we’re all created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives, we’ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either. And I won’t walk away from it now. I’m optimistic. I really am. I’m optimistic, Nancy. My fellow Americans, the issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are. It’s how old are our ideas. Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas, but you can’t lead America with ancient ideas. Only take us back. You lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done. Tonight, you’ve heard mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I see a future we’re defending democracy. You don’t diminish it. I see a future where we’ll restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot, and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. Above all, I see a future for all Americans. I see a country for all Americans, and I’ll always be president for all Americans because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. You’re the reason we’ve never been more optimistic about our future than I am now. So let’s build the future together. Let’s remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Inhalt: \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, hello, South Carolina.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Look, it’s good to be home with so many friends I’ve known for so long. And tonight, I’m thinking of so many of my friends who are no longer with us, like Fritz and Peatsy Hollings. And they were here for me when I first got started in a tough time in my life, when I didn’t want to stay in the Senate. They embraced me. They included me in everything and kept me going. They’re always with me in spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The same goes for Emily Clyburn. Jim is the reason that I’m president, because he endorsed me and got all you to help me. But I later learned Emily convinced him to endorse me. Jim, we miss her. And you’re the best friend anyone could have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, if I were smart, I’d say “Thank you” and leave because Jim made the case for me better than I can make the case for me. Folks, and I love Columbia so much I asked your former mayor to join me in the White House. We’re fortunate to have Steve Benjamin at my side. But we’re really fortunate we put his better half on the federal bench. She’s doing an incredible job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like I’m fortunate for my better half, Jill, who was here in Columbia last night with the women of Alpha Kappa Theta, Alpha Kappa Alpha, excuse me. She had a wonderful time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And we’ve got so many real leaders here. Two former Chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus: Joyce Beatty, and you heard Marcia Fudge. Don’t mess with Marcia. And my home state senator, Chris Coons, who, a real quick story. When my son passed away… Well, anyway, Chris was just wonderful. He wouldn’t take the job. He wouldn’t run until he knew it was okay. We had to call Chris and say, “Chris, please run.” Because it was “Beau’s chair,” he said. Our great DNC chairman, Jaime Harrison from South Carolina. But the truth is I wouldn’t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that’s a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I want to start with a very simple message: From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever doubt that the power to change America is in your hands, remember this: You proved it. You’re the reason I’m president. You’re the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. And you are the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You’re the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you are the reason we’re going to win and beat him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly four years ago, I came to Columbia to celebrate the primary victory, and I said then, and I quote, “For all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.” That same message has defined my presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m determined-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m determined to give all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind in America, a shot again, a fair shot at making a living, taking care of their children, starting a business, being able to buy a home, build real wealth for generations to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, maybe Donald Trump and his MAGA friends believe that they to have to hold us down to lift everybody else up. I don’t believe that. I believe that America is big enough, strong enough, blessed enough for all of us to succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s why we’re finally building an economy to grow from the middle out and the bottom up instead of trickle-down economy from the top. Because if you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. Just think back to the mess Donald Trump left this country in: a deadly pandemic, economic freefall, a violent insurrection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised to do everything in my power, I said at the time, to get us through one of the toughest periods in our history. And together we are. We vaccinated America. We created a record 14 million new jobs in three years. Let’s get something straight. Trump talks about putting checks in pockets, but in 2021, as soon as I came to office, I was the guy who sent every one of you those $1,400 checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, I sent those $300 checks per child per family per month for hardworking families. That was thousands of dollars in pockets to get people through a real crisis. And here’s what it did-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And here’s what it did. It helped cut Black poverty in half for Black children in America. Because no child in America should ever go hunger ever. When Trump pushed Black small businesses to the back of the line in the pandemic funding, I moved them to the front of the line. And today, Black small businesses are starting up at the fastest rate in 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But look, folks, things this country have been through have been pretty tough for a lot of people. But we’re making progress. There’s a lot more on the way. Inflation’s coming down. It’s now lower in America than any other major economy in the world. The cost of eggs, milk, chicken, gas, and so many other essential items have come down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But for all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off: price gouging, junk fees, greedflation, shrinkflation. You see that article about the Snickers bars? Well, it’s going to stop. Americans, we’re tired of being played for suckers. And that’s why we’re going to keep these guys, keep on them and get the prices down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, the bottom line is our economy has grown more in the last six months than it ever did at any point in Trump’s entire four years in office. And for too long, we imported products and exported jobs. But now, thanks to all we’re doing, we’re exporting American products and we’re bringing American jobs back home to America where they belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "America’s experiencing a manufacturing boom that no one thought was possible. But I knew it was possible. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs and counting, good-paying jobs. Record unemployment, including the lowest levels of Black unemployment ever recorded in American history. The racial wealth gap is at its lowest level in 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s $2 trillion tax cut when he was president benefited the super wealthy but was never paid for, and it completely blew up the federal deficit. We brought that deficit down. And all the progress we’ve made comes down to a simple proposition: Promises made and promises kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised, as Jim pointed out, that we beat Big Pharma, that charges more for prescription drug prices in America than anywhere else in the world, the same company, the same prescription. And we did. $35 a month insulin for seniors instead of 400 a month or more. As Jim pointed out, we tried to make that $35 available for everybody, but the Republicans blocked us. But with our vote in 2024, we’re going to make it happen for everyone. Everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jim pointed out, out-of-pocket costs for seniors for all their prescriptions will soon be capped at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $15,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, giving millions of families over $800 in premiums and protecting their care from preexisting conditions. And, by the way, basically doubling the Pell Grants, which is another issue, but that’s…\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, today, more Americans, more Black Americans have health insurance than ever in history. A promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised to help ease accumulated student debt for millions of folks carrying during the crisis of the pandemic. The Supreme Court blocked me, but it didn’t stop me. I found another way to help more than 3.7 million people, teachers, nurses, police officers, firefighters with $130 billion of relief. And causing the economy to grow faster as a consequence of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And another 25,000 people a month, beginning next month, are going to start to get their student loans forgiven, because they’re getting notified with a letter from me. You’re about to get that relief because of their public service so they can follow their dreams, start a business, buy a home, start a family. And I’m not done. Promises made and promises kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promise you we’d make record investments in HBCUs, including South Carolina’s eight HBCUs. HBCU students are just as talented as any student in America, but their colleges and universities don’t have the funding and endowments for the cutting-edge laboratories and research centers. Well, I’ve invested, so far, $7 billion in HBCUs and counting to help support our brilliant HBCUs students. And again, a promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I keep my promises when I said no one, no one should be in prison for merely possessing marijuana or using it. And their record should be expunged. A promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, I made a commitment to have an administration that looks like America, to tap into the fullest talents of our nation. And I’m proud we have the most diverse administration in the history of America, because I know our diversity is our strength in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was here in South Carolina that I promised to appoint the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. And by the way, she’s smarter than the rest. I have appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals than every other president in American history combined, combined. A promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that includes Judge Michelle Childs of the DC Circuit, who is making South Carolina proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised to take care of hundreds of thousands of veterans exposed to toxic materials and care for their families. That’s why I wrote the PACT Act. As Commander-in-Chief, I think we have only one sacred obligation, I’ve said it many times, prepare those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as Commander-in-Chief, I look at veterans completely differently than Donald Trump. Think about this, especially here in South Carolina, a proud military state, Donald Trump, when he was Commander-in-Chief, refused to visit a cemetery, a US cemetery outside of Paris for fallen American soldiers. And he referred to those heroes, and I quote, “as suckers and losers.” He actually said that. He said that. How dare he say that? How dare you talk about my son and all [inaudible 00:14:31] like that. Look, I call them patriots and heroes. The only loser I see is Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes me angry. I apologize for losing my temper, but it really, really, really offends me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, we’re starting to see real evidence that American consumers are facing real confidence in their economy we’re building. Let me tell you who else is noticing that: Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see what he recently said about that he wants to see the economy crash this year? A sitting president. As they say in my faith, “Bless me, Father, for…” I mean, come on, man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“When there’s a crash,” he said, “When there’s a crash, I hope in the next 12 months,” he went on to say. It’s unbelievable. It’s un-American. How can anyone, especially a former president, wish for an economic crash that would devastate millions of Americans? Well, let me tell you what he really means. Donald Trump knows this economy is good and strong and getting stronger. He knows that while it’s good for America, it’s bad for him politically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also said the one president he doesn’t want to be is Herbert Hoover. Well, Donald is too late. There are only two presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than when they took office: Herbert Hoover and yes, Donald “Herbert Hoover” Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, have you noticed he’s a little confused these days? He apparently can’t tell the difference between Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, folks we’re making real progress on one of the most important issues we’re facing: security at the border. The first bill introduced was for a massive change in security at our border. Two months ago, my team beginning to work with a bipartisan group of senators to put together the toughest, smartest, fairest border security bill in history, the best one the nation’s ever seen. It would finally provide the funding I requested early on and again in October to secure our borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It includes an additional 1,300 border patrols. We need more agents on the border. 375 immigration judges to judge whether or not someone can come or not come and be fair about it. 1,600 are asylum officers. And over 100 cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl coming outside our southwest border. It’ll also give me, as president, the emergency authority to shut down the border until it could get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I’d shut down the border right now and fix it quickly. A bipartisan bill would be good for American help fix our broken immigration system and allow speedy access for those who deserve to be here. And Congress needs to get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, we’re just getting started. That’s why I’m so optimistic about our future. 40,000 projects across America and counting, rebuilding our roads and our bridges; affordable high-speed Internet everywhere in America; ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America so every child can turn on a faucet, drink clean water without worrying about brain damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades. And I will not stop until we once again ban assault weapons, as I did once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, look, I want you to imagine the future nightmare of Trump back in office. I’m serious. Given the nightmare when he was in office, you know what’s likely to come. Trump and his MAGA friends are trying again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and ripping away the protections you have under that, even if you have a preexisting condition. I won’t let that happen. Are you with me? I’ll not let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And instead of saving Social Security for working people and the middle class, although he said he wanted to get rid of it or change it, cut it drastically. He now says he’s for it. But guess what? Trump and his MAGA friends will give another massive tax break to the super wealthy and the biggest corporations. I won’t let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, I know you’re with me. I know this: Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your freedoms, like the freedom to vote. Trump brags about taking away a woman’s freedom to choose. And now they’re hatching a plan for a national ban, a national ban. I won’t let that happen. Are you with me?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve made it clear: If MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on abortion, I will veto it. And consider that a promise made and a promise will be kept. If you reelect me and Kamala, with a Democratic House and a bigger majority in the Senate this November, imagine the future where we restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. A promise made, and a promise will be kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me close with this. A few weeks-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me close with this. A few weeks ago, along with Jim, I spoke at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston. I said there are extreme and dangerous forces at work in this country dividing us, not uniting us; dragging us back to the past instead of leading us to a future; refusing to accept the results of legitimate elections; seeking, as Trump says, to terminate the Constitution; embracing political violence and white supremacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I said in Charleston, there’s a second Lost Cause emerging in America. The first Lost Cause perpetuated the lie that slavery wasn’t the cause of the Civil War. And we’ve been paying a price for that lie for generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The second Lost Cause is Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen. We cannot allow that lie to live either because it threatens our very democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, there are truth, and there are lies. Lies told for power, lies told for profit. We must call out these lies with a voice that is clear and unyielding. The Bible teaches, “We shall know the truth, and the truth shall set us free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends, we must speak the truth, that America, in America we still believe in honesty, decency, dignity, respect. We believe we’re all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We leave no one behind. Everyone deserves a fair shot. We give hate no safe harbor. And we stand against the evil of racism, the poison of white supremacy today, tomorrow, and always. And we will live in the light, not darkness. We’ll stand with the truth and defeat the lies. And when we do, we’ll be able to look back and say something few generations have been able to say: America’s democracy was at risk, and we saved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you with me? Let’s finish what we started. February 3rd is your primary, the first in the nation. Organize, mobilize, vote. Let’s remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. And there’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we stand together.\n",

      "Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Look, it’s good to be home with so many friends I’ve known for so long. And tonight, I’m thinking of so many of my friends who are no longer with us, like Fritz and Peatsy Hollings. And they were here for me when I first got started in a tough time in my life, when I didn’t want to stay in the Senate. They embraced me. They included me in everything and kept me going. They’re always with me in spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The same goes for Emily Clyburn. Jim is the reason that I’m president, because he endorsed me and got all you to help me. But I later learned Emily convinced him to endorse me. Jim, we miss her. And you’re the best friend anyone could have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, if I were smart, I’d say “Thank you” and leave because Jim made the case for me better than I can make the case for me. Folks, and I love Columbia so much I asked your former mayor to join me in the White House. We’re fortunate to have Steve Benjamin at my side. But we’re really fortunate we put his better half on the federal bench. She’s doing an incredible job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like I’m fortunate for my better half, Jill, who was here in Columbia last night with the women of Alpha Kappa Theta, Alpha Kappa Alpha, excuse me. She had a wonderful time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And we’ve got so many real leaders here. Two former Chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus: Joyce Beatty, and you heard Marcia Fudge. Don’t mess with Marcia. And my home state senator, Chris Coons, who, a real quick story. When my son passed away… Well, anyway, Chris was just wonderful. He wouldn’t take the job. He wouldn’t run until he knew it was okay. We had to call Chris and say, “Chris, please run.” Because it was “Beau’s chair,” he said. Our great DNC chairman, Jaime Harrison from South Carolina. But the truth is I wouldn’t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that’s a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I want to start with a very simple message: From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever doubt that the power to change America is in your hands, remember this: You proved it. You’re the reason I’m president. You’re the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. And you are the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You’re the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you are the reason we’re going to win and beat him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly four years ago, I came to Columbia to celebrate the primary victory, and I said then, and I quote, “For all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.” That same message has defined my presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m determined-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m determined to give all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind in America, a shot again, a fair shot at making a living, taking care of their children, starting a business, being able to buy a home, build real wealth for generations to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, maybe Donald Trump and his MAGA friends believe that they to have to hold us down to lift everybody else up. I don’t believe that. I believe that America is big enough, strong enough, blessed enough for all of us to succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s why we’re finally building an economy to grow from the middle out and the bottom up instead of trickle-down economy from the top. Because if you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. Just think back to the mess Donald Trump left this country in: a deadly pandemic, economic freefall, a violent insurrection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised to do everything in my power, I said at the time, to get us through one of the toughest periods in our history. And together we are. We vaccinated America. We created a record 14 million new jobs in three years. Let’s get something straight. Trump talks about putting checks in pockets, but in 2021, as soon as I came to office, I was the guy who sent every one of you those $1,400 checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, I sent those $300 checks per child per family per month for hardworking families. That was thousands of dollars in pockets to get people through a real crisis. And here’s what it did-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And here’s what it did. It helped cut Black poverty in half for Black children in America. Because no child in America should ever go hunger ever. When Trump pushed Black small businesses to the back of the line in the pandemic funding, I moved them to the front of the line. And today, Black small businesses are starting up at the fastest rate in 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But look, folks, things this country have been through have been pretty tough for a lot of people. But we’re making progress. There’s a lot more on the way. Inflation’s coming down. It’s now lower in America than any other major economy in the world. The cost of eggs, milk, chicken, gas, and so many other essential items have come down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But for all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off: price gouging, junk fees, greedflation, shrinkflation. You see that article about the Snickers bars? Well, it’s going to stop. Americans, we’re tired of being played for suckers. And that’s why we’re going to keep these guys, keep on them and get the prices down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, the bottom line is our economy has grown more in the last six months than it ever did at any point in Trump’s entire four years in office. And for too long, we imported products and exported jobs. But now, thanks to all we’re doing, we’re exporting American products and we’re bringing American jobs back home to America where they belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "America’s experiencing a manufacturing boom that no one thought was possible. But I knew it was possible. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs and counting, good-paying jobs. Record unemployment, including the lowest levels of Black unemployment ever recorded in American history. The racial wealth gap is at its lowest level in 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s $2 trillion tax cut when he was president benefited the super wealthy but was never paid for, and it completely blew up the federal deficit. We brought that deficit down. And all the progress we’ve made comes down to a simple proposition: Promises made and promises kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised, as Jim pointed out, that we beat Big Pharma, that charges more for prescription drug prices in America than anywhere else in the world, the same company, the same prescription. And we did. $35 a month insulin for seniors instead of 400 a month or more. As Jim pointed out, we tried to make that $35 available for everybody, but the Republicans blocked us. But with our vote in 2024, we’re going to make it happen for everyone. Everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jim pointed out, out-of-pocket costs for seniors for all their prescriptions will soon be capped at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $15,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, giving millions of families over $800 in premiums and protecting their care from preexisting conditions. And, by the way, basically doubling the Pell Grants, which is another issue, but that’s…\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, today, more Americans, more Black Americans have health insurance than ever in history. A promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised to help ease accumulated student debt for millions of folks carrying during the crisis of the pandemic. The Supreme Court blocked me, but it didn’t stop me. I found another way to help more than 3.7 million people, teachers, nurses, police officers, firefighters with $130 billion of relief. And causing the economy to grow faster as a consequence of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And another 25,000 people a month, beginning next month, are going to start to get their student loans forgiven, because they’re getting notified with a letter from me. You’re about to get that relief because of their public service so they can follow their dreams, start a business, buy a home, start a family. And I’m not done. Promises made and promises kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promise you we’d make record investments in HBCUs, including South Carolina’s eight HBCUs. HBCU students are just as talented as any student in America, but their colleges and universities don’t have the funding and endowments for the cutting-edge laboratories and research centers. Well, I’ve invested, so far, $7 billion in HBCUs and counting to help support our brilliant HBCUs students. And again, a promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I keep my promises when I said no one, no one should be in prison for merely possessing marijuana or using it. And their record should be expunged. A promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, I made a commitment to have an administration that looks like America, to tap into the fullest talents of our nation. And I’m proud we have the most diverse administration in the history of America, because I know our diversity is our strength in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was here in South Carolina that I promised to appoint the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. And by the way, she’s smarter than the rest. I have appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals than every other president in American history combined, combined. A promise made and a promise kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that includes Judge Michelle Childs of the DC Circuit, who is making South Carolina proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised to take care of hundreds of thousands of veterans exposed to toxic materials and care for their families. That’s why I wrote the PACT Act. As Commander-in-Chief, I think we have only one sacred obligation, I’ve said it many times, prepare those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as Commander-in-Chief, I look at veterans completely differently than Donald Trump. Think about this, especially here in South Carolina, a proud military state, Donald Trump, when he was Commander-in-Chief, refused to visit a cemetery, a US cemetery outside of Paris for fallen American soldiers. And he referred to those heroes, and I quote, “as suckers and losers.” He actually said that. He said that. How dare he say that? How dare you talk about my son and all  like that. Look, I call them patriots and heroes. The only loser I see is Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes me angry. I apologize for losing my temper, but it really, really, really offends me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, we’re starting to see real evidence that American consumers are facing real confidence in their economy we’re building. Let me tell you who else is noticing that: Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see what he recently said about that he wants to see the economy crash this year? A sitting president. As they say in my faith, “Bless me, Father, for…” I mean, come on, man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“When there’s a crash,” he said, “When there’s a crash, I hope in the next 12 months,” he went on to say. It’s unbelievable. It’s un-American. How can anyone, especially a former president, wish for an economic crash that would devastate millions of Americans? Well, let me tell you what he really means. Donald Trump knows this economy is good and strong and getting stronger. He knows that while it’s good for America, it’s bad for him politically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also said the one president he doesn’t want to be is Herbert Hoover. Well, Donald is too late. There are only two presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than when they took office: Herbert Hoover and yes, Donald “Herbert Hoover” Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, have you noticed he’s a little confused these days? He apparently can’t tell the difference between Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, folks we’re making real progress on one of the most important issues we’re facing: security at the border. The first bill introduced was for a massive change in security at our border. Two months ago, my team beginning to work with a bipartisan group of senators to put together the toughest, smartest, fairest border security bill in history, the best one the nation’s ever seen. It would finally provide the funding I requested early on and again in October to secure our borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It includes an additional 1,300 border patrols. We need more agents on the border. 375 immigration judges to judge whether or not someone can come or not come and be fair about it. 1,600 are asylum officers. And over 100 cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl coming outside our southwest border. It’ll also give me, as president, the emergency authority to shut down the border until it could get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I’d shut down the border right now and fix it quickly. A bipartisan bill would be good for American help fix our broken immigration system and allow speedy access for those who deserve to be here. And Congress needs to get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, we’re just getting started. That’s why I’m so optimistic about our future. 40,000 projects across America and counting, rebuilding our roads and our bridges; affordable high-speed Internet everywhere in America; ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America so every child can turn on a faucet, drink clean water without worrying about brain damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades. And I will not stop until we once again ban assault weapons, as I did once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, look, I want you to imagine the future nightmare of Trump back in office. I’m serious. Given the nightmare when he was in office, you know what’s likely to come. Trump and his MAGA friends are trying again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and ripping away the protections you have under that, even if you have a preexisting condition. I won’t let that happen. Are you with me? I’ll not let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And instead of saving Social Security for working people and the middle class, although he said he wanted to get rid of it or change it, cut it drastically. He now says he’s for it. But guess what? Trump and his MAGA friends will give another massive tax break to the super wealthy and the biggest corporations. I won’t let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, I know you’re with me. I know this: Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your freedoms, like the freedom to vote. Trump brags about taking away a woman’s freedom to choose. And now they’re hatching a plan for a national ban, a national ban. I won’t let that happen. Are you with me?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve made it clear: If MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on abortion, I will veto it. And consider that a promise made and a promise will be kept. If you reelect me and Kamala, with a Democratic House and a bigger majority in the Senate this November, imagine the future where we restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. A promise made, and a promise will be kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me close with this. A few weeks-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me close with this. A few weeks ago, along with Jim, I spoke at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston. I said there are extreme and dangerous forces at work in this country dividing us, not uniting us; dragging us back to the past instead of leading us to a future; refusing to accept the results of legitimate elections; seeking, as Trump says, to terminate the Constitution; embracing political violence and white supremacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I said in Charleston, there’s a second Lost Cause emerging in America. The first Lost Cause perpetuated the lie that slavery wasn’t the cause of the Civil War. And we’ve been paying a price for that lie for generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The second Lost Cause is Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen. We cannot allow that lie to live either because it threatens our very democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks, there are truth, and there are lies. Lies told for power, lies told for profit. We must call out these lies with a voice that is clear and unyielding. The Bible teaches, “We shall know the truth, and the truth shall set us free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends, we must speak the truth, that America, in America we still believe in honesty, decency, dignity, respect. We believe we’re all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We leave no one behind. Everyone deserves a fair shot. We give hate no safe harbor. And we stand against the evil of racism, the poison of white supremacy today, tomorrow, and always. And we will live in the light, not darkness. We’ll stand with the truth and defeat the lies. And when we do, we’ll be able to look back and say something few generations have been able to say: America’s democracy was at risk, and we saved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you with me? Let’s finish what we started. February 3rd is your primary, the first in the nation. Organize, mobilize, vote. Let’s remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. And there’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we stand together.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me say a few things before I take your questions. As you know, the special counsel released his findings today about their look into my handling of classified documents. I was pleased to see he reached the firm conclusion that no charges should be brought against me in this case. This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s when I was still a new United States senator. And the special counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely. I did not throw up any roadblocks. I sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the special counsel what he needed I went forward with a five-hour in-person interview over two days, on October the 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked by Hamas on the 7th and I was very occupied. I was in the middle of handling an international crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was especially pleased to see special counsel make clear the stark distinction and difference between this case and Mr. Trump’s case. Special counsel wrote, and I quote, “Several material distinctions between Mr. Trump’s case and Mr. Biden’s are clear.” Continuing to quote. “Most notably, after giving multiple chances to return classified documents to avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, we wanted to say Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations, including his home, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve seen the headlines since the report was released about my willful retention of documents. These assertions are not only misleading, they’re just plain wrong. On page 215, if you had a chance — I know it’s a thick document — on page 215, the report of the special counsel found the exact opposite. Here’s what he wrote. There is in fact a shortage of evidence that I willfully retained classified materials related to Afghanistan. On page 12, the special counsel also wrote for another documents, “The decision to decline criminal charges was straightforward. The evidence suggests that Mr. Biden did not willfully retain these documents.” The evidence said I did not willfully retain these documents. In addition, I know there’s some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There’s even reference that I don’t remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn’t any of their damn business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you something. Some of you have commented, I wear since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from Our Lady of… Every Memorial Day we hold a service remembering him, attended by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don’t need anyone to remind me when he passed away or if he passed away. Simple truth is I sat for a five-hour interview over two days of events going back 40 years at the same time I was managing an international crisis. Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case. That’s their decision to make, that’s the counsel’s decision to make. That’s his job. And they decided not to move forward. For any extraneous commentary, they don’t know what they’re talking about. It has no place in this report. The bottom line is the matter is now closed. I’m going to continue what I’ve always focused on, my job of being President of the United States of America. Thank you, and I’ll take some questions.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, no, they did not say that. He did not say that. Let me answer your question. The fact of the matter is what I didn’t want repeated, I didn’t want him to know and I didn’t read it to him, was I had written a long memorandum to President Obama, why we should not be in Afghanistan. And it was multiple pages. And so what I was referring to, I said classified, I should have said it should be private because it was a contact between the president and the vice president as to what was going on. That’s what he’s referring to. It was not classified information in that document. That was not classified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, what I would have done is oversee the transfer of the material that was in my offices. I should have done that. If I go back, I didn’t have the responsibility to that. That was my staff was supposed to do that, and they referenced that in the report. And my staff did not do it in the way that… For example, I didn’t know how half the boxes got in my garage until I found out staff gathered them up, put them together, and took them to the garage in my home. And all the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in my house. It wasn’t out, like in Mar-a-Lago, in a public place. And none of it was high classified. Didn’t have any of that red stuff on it — you know what I mean? — around the corners. None of that. And so I wish I had paid more attention to how the documents were being moved and where. I thought they were being moved to the Archives. I thought all of it was being moved. That’s what I thought. Now, what was the last part of your question?\n",

      "Let me say a few things before I take your questions. As you know, the special counsel released his findings today about their look into my handling of classified documents. I was pleased to see he reached the firm conclusion that no charges should be brought against me in this case. This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s when I was still a new United States senator. And the special counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely. I did not throw up any roadblocks. I sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the special counsel what he needed I went forward with a five-hour in-person interview over two days, on October the 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked by Hamas on the 7th and I was very occupied. I was in the middle of handling an international crisis.\n",

      "I was especially pleased to see special counsel make clear the stark distinction and difference between this case and Mr. Trump’s case. Special counsel wrote, and I quote, “Several material distinctions between Mr. Trump’s case and Mr. Biden’s are clear.” Continuing to quote. “Most notably, after giving multiple chances to return classified documents to avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, we wanted to say Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations, including his home, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.”\n",

      "I’ve seen the headlines since the report was released about my willful retention of documents. These assertions are not only misleading, they’re just plain wrong. On page 215, if you had a chance — I know it’s a thick document — on page 215, the report of the special counsel found the exact opposite. Here’s what he wrote. There is in fact a shortage of evidence that I willfully retained classified materials related to Afghanistan. On page 12, the special counsel also wrote for another documents, “The decision to decline criminal charges was straightforward. The evidence suggests that Mr. Biden did not willfully retain these documents.” The evidence said I did not willfully retain these documents. In addition, I know there’s some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There’s even reference that I don’t remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn’t any of their damn business.\n",

Some of you have commented, I wear since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from Our Lady of… Every Memorial Day we hold a service remembering him, attended by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don’t need anyone to remind me when he passed away or if he passed away. Simple truth is I sat for a five-hour interview over two days of events going back 40 years at the same time I was managing an international crisis. Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case. That’s their decision to make, that’s the counsel’s decision to make. That’s his job. And they decided not to move forward. For any extraneous commentary, they don’t know what they’re talking about. It has no place in this report. The bottom line is the matter is now closed. I’m going to continue what I’ve always focused on, my job of being President of the United States of America. Thank you, and I’ll take some questions.\n",

And it was multiple pages. And so what I was referring to, I said classified, I should have said it should be private because it was a contact between the president and the vice president as to what was going on.
