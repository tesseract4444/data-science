      "\n",
      "Wow. Hello Pennsylvania. What a great place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audience (00:03):\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you very much. You know the pilot said, “It’s too windy to land, sir.” I said, “That’s okay. Land anyway. We have no choice.” It’s windy out here. It’s windy, but it’s beautiful. It’s Pennsylvania. It’s our place. I’m thrilled to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots. That’s what you are. With your help, we’re going to win Pennsylvania. We’re going to defeat Crooked Joe Biden, and we’re going to make America great again.\n",
      "\n",
      "(00:51)\n",
      "Before going any further, I want to say God bless the people of Israel. They’re under attack right now. That’s because we show great weakness. This would not happen, the weakness that we’ve shown, it’s unbelievable and it would not have happened if we were in office. You know that, they know that, everybody knows that. But America prays for Israel. We send our absolute support to everyone in harm’s way.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:17)\n",
      "This is an attack that would not have happened. To think about what we have to go through and the things we put up with with the border, with no energy independence, with all electric cars. Would everybody like to buy an electric car for the rest of your life? But we will return the world to peace through strength, and it’ll happen very quickly. We’ll revive American strength abroad, and we will restore American strength at home. We were respected four years ago all over the world. Today, we are considered a joke. It’s not going to be for long, believe me. It’s not going to be for long.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:59)\n",
      "We will quickly rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world like we had just four years ago. It was just announced that inflation is once again raging. It’s close to 4% again. Here we go. When I left office, we had virtually no inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:16)\n",
      "First of all, Crooked Joe, he claimed inflation was transitory. Remember that? Then he said it was temporary. Then he said it won’t happen. It really won’t happen. And then he said, “Well, it’s much higher than expected.” And then the supply chain slows, and then the energy went through the roof. Putin, they called it Putin price hikes. It wasn’t only Putin. It was Putin and plenty of other things that Biden got wrong. [inaudible 00:02:44] with Putin, Ukraine would’ve never happened. Israel attack, both October 7th and today would’ve never happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:54)\n",
      "Then he blamed price gouging and junk fees. But all of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden. As Crooked as you can get. That’s why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, “You’re fired. Get out. You’re fired.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:20)\n",
      "One of the leading drivers of Biden’s inflation disasters is war on American energy, and Pennsylvania energy is our big problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "They’re not wrong. They’re not wrong. He’s done everything wrong. Think of it. We’ve been in this mess together for three and a half years, only a little more than six months until that most important day in the history of our country, November 5th. Think of that. [inaudible 00:04:10] nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:10)\n",
      "Has anything that he’s done turned out? Everything he touches turns to shit. It’s true. Under Biden, gasoline prices are up over 50%. And electricity prices are up 39%, rising 13 times faster than under the previous… Think of that, 13 times faster than under the previous seven years. When I’m back in the White House, we will end Joe Biden’s inflation train wreck, and we will tell Pennsylvania “Drill, baby, drill.” Get back to drilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:54)\n",
      "Under my leadership, we had energy independence, and soon we would’ve had energy dominance. We were going to be dominant. We were bigger than Russia. We were bigger than Saudi Arabia. And then he stopped. But then he started again. He went back to Trump policies because the price started going up so high. But the day after the election, first of all, if he wins, our country is going to be destroyed the day after the election, if he wins. He will stop drilling and he’ll go back to wind, which doesn’t work. He’ll go back to all sorts of things that don’t work. And they’ve proven that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:29)\n",
      "When it comes to Biden, he launched an extremist crusade actually to smash oil and gas, but Pennsylvania is one of the big oil and gas largely due to me. He wanted to smash it. Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that’s putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He’s risking your lives, he’s risking your jobs, but he doesn’t care because all he cares about is the Green New Scam, the Green New Deal, the Green New Scam. The Green New Scam, one of the biggest hoaxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:08)\n",
      "Biden’s also trying to abolish gasoline-powered automobiles and force everyone into an all electric car. But I have good news for you, all of you that love those trucks, he wants to make your truck all electric, too. No more gasoline-powered. On day one, I will terminate Crooked Joe’s insane electric vehicle mandate. Gone. Day one. That’s going to happen on day one. And I’ll end Joe Biden’s natural gas export ban on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, who I love. I went to school here. I went to school in Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:53)\n",
      "As we rescue our economy, we will also rescue our democracy. Our democracy is under, really under siege. Our Second Amendment is under siege, but not with me it’s not. With me they don’t touch it. But our Second Amendment is under siege. Our democracy is under siege because of Joe Biden. Joe Biden loves to say that democracy is on the ballot in this election. If it is, we’re going to win in the greatest landslide in history. Because we’re the ones who are fighting to save our democracy, and Crooked Joe Biden is the demented tyrant. He’s the demented tyrant who is trying to destroy our democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:33)\n",
      "Two days from now, the entire world will witness the commencement of the very first Biden trial. They’re all Biden trials, you know that, right? And I’m proud to do it for you. Have a good time watching. Have a good time watching. On Monday in New York City, I will be forced to sit fully gagged. I’m not allowed to talk. Can you believe it? They want to take away my constitutional right to talk. I have a crooked judge. This has never happened before, by the way, you do know that, right? Fully gagged before a highly conflicted and corrupt judge who suffers from TDS.\n",
      "\n",

      "Does anyone know what TDS is?\n",

      "Audience (08:21):\n",

      "Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump (08:23):\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct. Trump Derangement Syndrome. As the radical left Democrat party seeks to do anything possible to keep me from running and winning in this election. And let me tell you, we’re leading by so much, they don’t know what’s happening. But you know what they’d love to do? I did nothing wrong. From day one I did nothing. You had Russia, Russia. You had Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. You had every hoax imaginable. With all of the things they did with millions of pages of study, they found nothing, which makes me perhaps the most honest guy almost in the world, I think. They found nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:04)\n",
      "But like all true communist show trials, this is what you call a communist show trial. And we’re going communist. Don’t kid yourself. We don’t win this election, this country is finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audience (09:16):\n",
      "\n",
      "We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump. We love Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump (09:28):\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much. I love you, too. I love you, too. That’s why I put up with this stuff. Remember, I’ve been indicted more than Al Capone, the great gangster. I never heard the word indictment. I didn’t know. Now, all of a sudden, if I fly over a Democrat state, they call it a blue state. I get subpoenaed before a grand jury. It’s horrible. Honestly, it’s horrible what they’re doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:54)\n",
      "They’re ruining this country. They’re destroying the country in every way. There’s not a thing he’s done that’s been good. But this is a case of blatant manipulation of the law and the facts like Russia, Russia, Russia, and all of the other hoaxes that we’ve had to endure. The phony indictment has been torn apart and demolished by legal experts from across the political spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:14)\n",
      "Every single legal expert, without exception, that I can find has said as an example, Alan Dershowitz. Alan Dershowitz said, “I’ve been doing this for 60 years, teaching criminal cases, defending criminal cases, writing about criminal cases. And this is by far the weakest criminal case I’ve ever seen in my 60 years. There is absolutely nothing here. There is no misdemeanor, there is no felony, there is no federal crime. Every American is in danger if we don’t have an objective standard of justice that’s equally applicable to all.” That’s Alan Dershowitz. He’s a Democrat. He’s no fan of mine. He’s a Democrat and a Harvard professor, smart guy, but he’s a Democrat. He writes that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:02)\n",
      "Here’s another one. Highly respected, former federal prosecutor, Andrew McCarthy stated: “It would take us an hour just to flush out all of the problems with this case. The premise of this prosecution is falsification.” What Bragg, that’s Alvin Bragg. He’s a Soros-appointed prosecutor. And by the way, crime in New York is at record highs. The violent crime, murders, killings, all of this stuff, muggings. And he leaves them alone. They’ve got… When I go into court over nothing, it’s not a crime. When I go into court, they’ve got like nine prosecutors. And in the meantime, people that murder, nobody does anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:45)\n",
      "What Bragg, Alvin Bragg is trying to do is enforce federal campaign finance law, which he doesn’t have any authority whatsoever do. He’s not allowed to finance. And by the way, the federal government looked at it, turned it down. It’s a garbage case that he himself rejected a year earlier. When Bragg came into office, he’s the district attorney. He said, “I’m not doing this case. This case is bullshit.” And then what happens? He does the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:11)\n",
      "And you know, here’s the thing. They could have done this case seven years ago. You know the way they’re trying to rush it? This case would’ve been fine. Seven years ago, do whatever you want. They do it right smack in the middle of our election campaign. And I talk about our campaign. We want to do it now. And the same thing with Deranged Jack Smith, all of these people, these are Biden people. He can’t win an election. He can’t put two sentences together. He can’t find the stairs on a platform to walk off after he makes about a two-minute speech. Here they are. I got one, two, three. I got one in the back. I got them all over the place. He can’t find them. He’s looking around, “Where are the stairs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:55)\n",
      "All they’re trying to do, they’re weaponizing government. They’re trying to harm your favorite president, hurt him so that we can’t win an election. They’ve weaponized elections like a third-world country, like a Banana Republic. Renowned legal scholar, very smart guy, Jonathan Turley, likewise stated, “It’s a real Frankenstein case. It’s made up of different parts that don’t hold together, and it’s frightening if this can be replicated in the future. You can’t do cases like this. This is an outrage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:28)\n",
      "A veteran New York City attorney told left-wing Rolling Stone Magazine, this is a magazine that I’ve never read, but probably doesn’t like Trump, left-wing is to put it mildly. “This case,” they say, this is Rolling Stone, “This case is a joke, frankly, and I’ve litigated against this office for 33 years. This case is an absolute joke.” These are people that hate me, they’re saying this. Can you imagine if they liked me, how good they’d be?\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:57)\n",
      "And a liberal Fordham University law professor writing in The New York Times called the case “A disaster, a legal embarrassment And a setback to the rule of law and order and a really bad thing for New York.” And businesses aren’t going to move into New York because of what they’re doing. Their legal system is shot. It’s a joke all over the world. But when I walk into that courtroom, I know I will have the love of 200 million Americans behind me, and I will be fighting for the… That’s right. That’s right. And I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:41)\n",
      "This election is a choice between the Biden-fascist state or the American republic. It’s called we are going to make this country so great again, and we’re going to do it fast. We’re going to do it really fast. Right now, millions of people are entering our country from prisons, from mental institutions. They’re coming from all over the world. All over the world. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to end the rule of law. And it’s a vote to destroy America as you know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:15)\n",
      "A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to save America’s future, a vote to save American democracy and a vote to save American freedom.\n",

They rig everything. We weren’t anticipated to win that election. And what I’ve\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump (16:00):\n",
      "\n",
      "… I’ve done to insult them is we won that election, and then we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016, getting millions and millions of votes more. But this is going to be really special, because I will tell you, 2016, we had spirit like nobody’s ever seen before. 2020 blew the spirit away of 2016. Not only do we get millions more votes, I think the spirit was even greater. But now, because we’ve seen how bad they are, added to the fact that you like the job I do, you like the fact that countries respect us. You like the fact that we were energy-independent, and all of the things. You like the fact that I got you the largest tax cut in the history of our country, and they’re going to raise your taxes by four times. Four times. Think of that. Take your taxes and multiply times four. That’s what you’re going to be paying if this person gets in.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:01)\n",
      "But I say this, and I said in 2016 that this is going to be the most important election we’ve ever had. But I say now, because 2016, I won to a certain extent on the border. And then I fixed the border. And when I fixed it, I wanted to make speeches in 2020 about the border. And my people said, “Sir…” But the difference is I listen to myself. I don’t listen to anybody. He listens to his people. He listens to his Communist handlers, okay? He does whatever they want him to do. But my people did say, “Sir, they don’t want to hear about the border. You fixed it.” I said, “I want to talk about the border.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:37)\n",
      "They said, “Sir, you fixed it.” We went on. We had an unbelievable election, getting millions more votes than we did in 2016, but the election was rigged. The election was rigged. Pure and simple, 2020 was rigged. It was a disgrace. We could never let it happen again. The difference, though, is this is compared to 2016 and the border, this border is a hundred times worse. This is the worst border of any country in the history of the world. There has never been a border like this, where millions and millions and millions of people are coming in, totally unchecked and unvetted.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:20)\n",
      "The American people are going to stand up, and they’re going to stand up to the lies and the witch hunt and the corruption of Biden. He is the most incompetent president in the history of our country. He is the most corrupt president in the history of our country, and he is the worst president by far in the history of our country, and we have to get him out on November 5th. We have to get Biden the hell out of office and send him back to wherever he comes from.\n",

      "Thank you very much. We have to get him out. You look at all the things that are happening, everything. The whole world is ablaze. It’s interesting. Viktor Orban, who is the prime minister of Hungary, very strong guy, very strong person, I think happens to be a very good person, but a very strong person. Doesn’t play games, didn’t want any illegal immigrants in his country. Then they say, “Oh, he’s such a bad…” Well, they asked him three weeks ago, “What’s going on with the world? What’s going on? Everybody’s fighting. Russia, Ukraine, Israel. The Middle East is blowing up. Everything’s blowing up. China’s going to be next with Taiwan, because of weakness. China’s going to be next. What’s going on?”\n",

      "He said, “Bring Donald Trump back as president, and it’ll all stop. It’ll all stop.” He said it. And he said something else, and I wouldn’t say it, because I wouldn’t really like the word. “China was afraid of Donald Trump. Russia was afraid of Donald Trump. Everybody was afraid.” I don’t want to say that. I want to say they respected me. But the fact is, none of this stuff would be happening. None of it would be happening right now. We’d have a country that would be peaceful, prosperous. We would’ve had no inflation. Inflation was caused by energy. This stupid person, what he did with energy was that it went up 40, 50, 60%. That affects everything. Everything. If you make donuts, everything is more expensive. It’s so bad. When you look at food prices now, where it’s gone up by double and triple and quadruple, and you can never get that back. But we’re going to get it way down, I promise you.\n",
      "\n",
      "(21:11)\n",
      "And we’re going to bring your energy so low that other things will follow. And that’s what happened. It’s very simple. Instead of trying to have corrupt prosecutors fight his battles, he’s incompetent, and what he’s doing, and I don’t believe it’s even him. I think it’s the people that want to keep their jobs around him. They’re Communists. They want to keep the job. Because I don’t think he has any clue. I don’t think he has any clue. So listen, we have a little… Look at this one. That’s for him. It’s slight. I call it slight. See the podium? I’m calling on crooked Joe Biden to debate anytime, anywhere, anyplace, right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "(21:57)\n",
      "We have to debate, because our country is going in the wrong direction so badly. And while it’s a little bit typically early, we have to debate. We have to explain to the American people what the hell is going on. Because they’re looking at the border and they’re looking at inflation, and they’re looking at the economy, which is terrible. They’re looking at every single aspect of our country. They look at the fact that the world is laughing at our leader, and laughing at us.\n",

      "And just four years ago, was the exact opposite. We were the most respected country in the world. We were the most respected that we were ever respected. We were never more respected than we were four years ago. It’s no wonder Joe Biden and his thugs… That’s all they are, they’re weak thugs… Are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them. And all of this persecution of Donald Trump, I don’t mind. I’m doing it for you. I’m doing it for you. But all of this persecution is only happening because I’m running for president, and leading very big in the polls. We’re leading so big. They’re going crazy. They are going crazy.\n",

And nationwide, we’re leading by four points, six points, nine points, 11 points. We’re leading by a lot. Now they cheat so we have to give ourselves a lead. They cheat like hell. And when you see them cheating, you get out there and start screaming. Start screaming. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we’re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, Communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor, because I am being indicted for you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom, because I will never, ever let them take away your freedom. I will not let it happen. It’s what they’re trying to do. They want to silence me, because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they’re not after me. They’re after you.

We had the safest border, the most secure border in the history of our country four years ago, the safest border in the history of our country. There are charts out that just came out from Homeland Security, if you can believe that. And I don’t know where the hell your board is. Put it up inside of the back of my head. I’d love to have that chart. But it shows that the lowest number ever of illegal immigrants coming in was my last week in office before this very, very, very horrible president took over. One thing good about it, though, Jimmy Carter is a nice man. Jimmy Carter looks like a brilliant president by comparison to crooked Joe Biden. Crooked Joe Biden, he is the worst. Jimmy Carter is a happy man.\n",

That’s the lowest number in the history of our country the week that I went out. And then look at after that, it looks like a rocket ship.

What an unbelievable, I mean, it was so much, and so interesting and so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful and so many different ways. It represented such a big portion of the success of this country; Gettysburg. Wow. I go to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to look and to watch. And the statement of Robert E. Lee, who’s no longer in favor. Did you ever notice that? No longer in favor. “Never fight uphill, me boys, never fight uphill.” They were fighting uphill.

      "\n",
      "Well, thank you very much. They call it Super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one. And they tell me the pundits and otherwise that there’s never been one like this. There’s never been anything so conclusive. This was an amazing night, an amazing day. It’s been an incredible period of time in our country’s history. It’s been sad in so many ways, but I think it’s going to be inspiring because we’re going to do something that, frankly, nobody’s been able to do for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:23)\n",
      "We’ve watched our country take a great beating over the last three years. And nobody thought a thing like this would be possible. We wouldn’t have Russia attacking Ukraine. We wouldn’t have Israel being attacked. Iran, as you know, was broke when I was running things. They were broke. They didn’t have money for Hamas. They didn’t have money for Hezbollah. We had no inflation. Inflation is destroying the middle class. It’s destroying everything. Inflation, if you look back over the history, hundreds of years back, it’s called inflation. It’s called a country buster. And that’s what it’s doing to our country. What’s happened with inflation has been unbelievable. A lot of people say, a lot of experts have said the stock market’s the only thing that’s doing well, and that’s doing well because our poll numbers are so much higher than Joe Biden’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:24)\n",
      "He’s the worst president in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like what’s happening to our country. Today, it was announced that 325,000 people were flown in from parts unknown. Migrants were flown in airplane, not going through borders, not going through that great Texas barrier that I was with the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott the other day, and we were looking at the job they’re doing, but in the meantime, they’re pouring into California, and they’re pouring into Arizona because those governors aren’t doing anything. They’re doing nothing. But today, it was just announced before I came out, it was unbelievable. I said, that must be a mistake. They flew 325,000 migrants, flew them in over the borders into our country. So that really tells you where they’re coming from. They want open borders, and open borders are going to destroy our country. We need borders, and we need free and fair elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:25)\n",
      "And we don’t have a country. This is an incredible group of people, so many celebrities that I’m not going to introduce any, because I’m just going to get myself in trouble if I do that because I’ll leave out most of you. This is a room chock-full of incredible talented people, like some of the guys standing right in front of me, big futures, big, fat, beautiful futures. Oh, I’d love to be your age. I’d pay you a lot of money to be your age. But we have some tremendously talented people in this room, including tremendously talented political people that have helped me right from the beginning. We had the safest border in the history of our country. We built 571 miles of wall. We had Mexico supply us with 28,000 soldiers because we wanted them, that’s why. And they said, “We won’t do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:20)\n",
      "I said, “Yes, you will. You will.” And in the end, they did. It was an easy negotiation. But we had the safest border, the best numbers we’ve ever had. And now, we have the worst numbers, probably in the history of the world. It’s sad to see what’s happening to our cities. Our cities are being overrun with migrant crime, and that’s Biden migrant crime, but it’s a new category of crime. And it’s violent where they’ll stand in the middle of the street and have fist fights with police officers. And if they did that in their countries from where they came, they’d be killed instantly, instantly. They wouldn’t do that. So the world is laughing at us. The world is taking advantage of us. Three years ago, we were at a level. We were energy independent. We’re going to be very shortly energy dominant. And today, we’re getting oil from Venezuela. Can you believe it? And we’re doing numbers on that oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:18)\n",
      "You know what we’re doing? We’re refining the oil. We have our refinery for that oil. It’s really, I call it tar. It’s not oil. It’s terrible. We have real stuff, but we’re refining it in Houston. So for all of the environmentalists, you ought to look at that because all of that tar is going right up into the atmosphere. You just ought to take a look. It’s the only plant that can do it. We have the only plants that can take tar and make it into oil. And that’s what it is. It’s a shame. But we were energy independent. We were going to be energy dominant. We were going to be supplying oil to Europe all over the world. And then a tragic thing happened during the election. It was a tragedy because you wouldn’t have, think of it, all of the problems that you have today, I don’t think you would’ve had any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:06)\n",
      "You’d only have success. And that’s what’s ultimately going to unify this country and unify this party. We have a great Republican Party with tremendous talent, and we want to have unity, and we’re going to have unity. And it’s going to happen very quickly. And I have been saying lately, success will bring unity to our country. And it happened before. We had the best economy our country’s ever had, and people were calling me that I would’ve said will never happen. It’ll never happen. They wanted to get together, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American women, men, people with diplomas from the best schools in the world, and people that didn’t graduate from high school. Every single group was doing better than ever before. And it was a beautiful thing. Our country was coming together.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:59)\n",
      "Our country was coming together. And now, we have a very divided country. We have a country that a political person uses weaponization against his political opponent never happened here. It happens in other countries, but they’re Third World countries. And in some ways, we’re a Third World country. We’re a Third World country at our borders, and we’re a Third World country at our elections, and we have to stop that. We need a fair and free press. The press has not been fair, nor has it been free. But maybe someday they will be. They’re being beaten up pretty badly. People aren’t trusting them. They’re not believing them. And, really, it’s a very important factor. The press used to be the policemen. It used to police our country. Now, nobody has confidence in them, and we have to get that confidence back. It’s so important for the success of our country. So important.\n",

      "(10:03)\n",
      "So this has been a day that we’ve been waiting for. I want to thank my family for being here. It’s a great family. I have a great family. They’ve had it very easy since I decided to run for politics. They say, “Thanks a lot, Dad. We appreciate it.” But they’re strong and they’re very capable people and they love the country. They really do love the country, and we appreciate it. And I want to thank everybody, my staff. Susie. Chris, incredible job. Incredible job you’ve done.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:42)\n",
      "I read an article yesterday where it said, “This is one of the finest run campaigns that anybody has ever seen.” That’s pretty good, right? That’s pretty good. It’s really a statement. And we have no choice because November 5th, it’s right around the corner. November 5th is going to go down as the single most important day in the history of our country.\n",

      "We’re going to take it, and we’re going to make it like it should be, respected. Right now, we’re not respected. Right now, our country is known as a joke. It’s a joke. Other leaders who I speak to, other leaders can’t believe what happened to us because three years ago, we were the most respected country anywhere in the world by far. We were doing things that nobody could believe. China was paying us billions and billions of dollars. In 25 years, they paid us nothing. Zero, not 10 cents. I was getting billions of dollars. And they were happy about it as happy as you can be.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:09)\n",
      "Of course, maybe there’s reasons for things having happened, but they were not so happy with certain things, I guess, based on things that took place. But we were getting along with everybody. We were getting along, and we were respected by everybody. We had no wars. Remember when I had the debate with Hillary Clinton, she said, “Look. Look at him. Look at that personality. He’s going to cause wars, wars.” I said, “No, my personality is going to keep us out of wars. And that’s what happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:48)\n",
      "For 20 years, they were fighting ISIS. I defeated ISIS in four weeks. I got rid of ISIS 100%. 100% of the ISIS caliphate, and we had no wars, and we stopped wars. We weren’t getting along with a lot of countries. All of a sudden, North Korea, which is a serious nuclear power, but North Korea came along. Kim Jong Un, we got along very well. We got along very well with China until COVID. That was a little bit too much as far as I was concerned. That was too much. Couldn’t take that one. But we made a trade deal with China that I don’t even talk about 50 billion a year in product. They bought from our farmers, our manufacturers. They used to buy 10. I got 50, and it was great, but COVID, I don’t even talk about that because COVID was such a horrible thing. It started in the Wuhan labs, just as I said, the Wuhan labs, and it came out, I believe, through incompetence. I believe it was incompetence. Some people think it wasn’t, but I believe it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:55)\n",
      "But regardless, of course, $60 trillion worth of damage and death all over the world, all over the world. And we did a fantastic job on that. We never got credit for that. Unbelievable job on that. We came up with things that nobody thought was possible. Don’t forget when it came in, nobody had an idea what it was. They didn’t even use the word pandemic. Nobody had an idea. But we did a fantastic job, and we got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for our foreign policy. I think credit, like nobody, very few people have gotten in.The press was very honest about it. They gave us very high marks on foreign policy, the Abraham Accord. So many different things we did. But we never got the kind of dew that we should have for the COVID or as I call it, affectionately the Chinese virus, the China virus, which is a much more accurate term.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:57)\n",
      "And despite that, the stock market, when we turned it over, the stock market was higher than it was prior to COVID coming in. It was an amazing thing. We did an amazing job, and we have so many people that worked on that. So many of the doctors, so many of the scientists that worked with us on that. It was really, really something. But there’s never been an administration that had more success in so many different elements. We got the largest tax cuts in history. We have the largest regulation cuts in history. We rebuilt our military. And what happened, we rebuilt our entire military and beautiful. We had jet fighters that were 53 years old, and we had all brand new jet fighters. And then after this other group of people that didn’t know what they were doing, they took over, and we had that horrible surrender in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:57)\n",
      "I call it a surrender. We took the soldiers out first. I dealt with the leaders of the Taliban in Afghanistan. They were the ones that were causing the trouble. The press was very angry because they said, “Why are you calling them?” I said, because that’s where the problem is. I say, oftentimes. I say, they asked Jesse James, “Jesse, why do you rob banks?” He said, “Because that’s where the money is.” And I said, “That’s where the problem is with the Taliban.” And I spoke to Abdul. He’s still the leader, believe it or not. He’s really the leader of Afghanistan, but he’s the leader of the Taliban, a rough group. I say, “Don’t ever shoot our soldiers again. Don’t ever do it.” Very interesting, what happened is that we were having… During the Obama administration, previously, they were shooting a lot of our soldiers, and I let them know.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:48)\n",
      "I said, “Don’t ever, ever let that happen.” I said, in a rather nasty fashion, “We don’t have to go into it tonight.” For 18 months, we lost nobody in Afghanistan. And then we had that horrible, horrible withdrawal where we lost 13 soldiers, 38 horribly wounded, left Americans behind. You have Americans right now still behind. Call them hostages, if you like. It was a terrible moment. We left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful equipment behind jets and tanks, and everything you can think of, goggles, night goggles. They didn’t use to fight. They’re good fighters. They didn’t use to fight at night. But now, they do because they have goggles. They have better goggles than we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:35)\n",
      "So I just want to tell you that led to a lot of bad things. And now, the worst things are happening. The things that are happening now are unthinkable. And they’re unthinkable at the border. We have millions of people invading our country. This is an invasion. This is the worst invasion probably. We’ve never had anything like it. No country has ever had anything like it. The number today could be 15 million people, and they’re coming from rough places and dangerous places, and we had that shut down. We had everything going so beautifully. When Joe Biden goes to the beach because somebody on his staff thinks he looks very good in a bathing suit, until he can’t get his feet out of the sand or lift the chair, which weighs about nine ounces.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:28)\n",
      "Joe Biden, if he would’ve just left everything alone, he could have gone to the beach. He would’ve had a tremendous success at the border and elsewhere. So we’re going to take back our country. We’re going to make sure we are going to do it right. We’re going to have the greatest economy ever in the history of our country. We’re going to top what we did.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:58)\n",
      "We’re going to become an energy center of the world. We are ready to become energy dominant. And they stopped that. They stopped that. But we are going to become energy dominant. We’re going to pay off debt. We’re going to do things that nobody thought was possible. We hadn’t done our second phase of the tax cuts. Well, we did the tax cuts. The Democrats fought us very hard. And now, they say, “Well, I guess that was pretty good because we took in much more revenues after we cut taxes.” And then we did all of those regulation cuts, and people were working and everybody was happy, and we were all proud of our country, but we’re going to win this election because we have no choice. If we lose the election, we’re not going to have a country though. And we are going to do something. Thank you very much.\n",

We have many, many criminals that have entered our country. We have people coming in from such bad places, and we’re going to have to get them out. We have murderers that are being deposited into our country. We have drug dealers at the biggest and highest levels that are coming into our country.

They’ve had it very easy since I decided to run for politics. They say, “Thanks a lot, Dad. We appreciate it.” But they’re strong and they’re very capable people and they love the country.

Other leaders who I speak to, other leaders can’t believe what happened to us because three years ago, we were the most respected country anywhere in the world by far. We were doing things that nobody could believe. China was paying us billions and billions of dollars. In 25 years, they paid us nothing. Zero, not 10 cents. I was getting billions of dollars. And they were happy about it as happy as you can be.\n",

We were getting along, and we were respected by everybody. We had no wars. Remember when I had the debate with Hillary Clinton, she said, “Look. Look at him. Look at that personality. He’s going to cause wars, wars.” I said, “No, my personality is going to keep us out of wars. And that’s what happened.”\n",

We weren’t getting along with a lot of countries. All of a sudden, North Korea, which is a serious nuclear power, but North Korea came along. Kim Jong Un, we got along very well. We got along very well with China until COVID. That was a little bit too much as far as I was concerned. That was too much. Couldn’t take that one. But we made a trade deal with China that I don’t even talk about 50 billion a year in product. They bought from our farmers, our manufacturers. They used to buy 10. I got 50, and it was great, but COVID, I don’t even talk about that because COVID was such a horrible thing. It started in the Wuhan labs, just as I said, the Wuhan labs, and it came out, I believe, through incompetence. I believe it was incompetence. Some people think it wasn’t, but I believe it was.\n",

Unbelievable job on that. We came up with things that nobody thought was possible. Don’t forget when it came in, nobody had an idea what it was. They didn’t even use the word pandemic. Nobody had an idea. But we did a fantastic job, and we got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for our foreign policy. I think credit, like nobody, very few people have gotten in.The press was very honest about it. They gave us very high marks on foreign policy, the Abraham Accord. So many different things we did. But we never got the kind of dew that we should have for the COVID or as I call it, affectionately the Chinese virus, the China virus, which is a much more accurate term.\n",

We did an amazing job, and we have so many people that worked on that. So many of the doctors, so many of the scientists that worked with us on that. It was really, really something. But there’s never been an administration that had more success in so many different elements. We got the largest tax cuts in history. We have the largest regulation cuts in history. We rebuilt our military. And what happened, we rebuilt our entire military and beautiful. We had jet fighters that were 53 years old, and we had all brand new jet fighters. And then after this other group of people that didn’t know what they were doing, they took over, and we had that horrible surrender in Afghanistan.\n",

The press was very angry because they said, “Why are you calling them?” I said, because that’s where the problem is. I say, oftentimes. I say, they asked Jesse James, “Jesse, why do you rob banks?” He said, “Because that’s where the money is.” And I said, “That’s where the problem is with the Taliban.” And I spoke to Abdul. He’s still the leader, believe it or not. He’s really the leader of Afghanistan, but he’s the leader of the Taliban, a rough group. I say, “Don’t ever shoot our soldiers again. Don’t ever do it.” Very interesting, what happened is that we were having… During the Obama administration, previously, they were shooting a lot of our soldiers, and I let them know.\n",

      "I said, “Don’t ever, ever let that happen.” I said, in a rather nasty fashion, “We don’t have to go into it tonight.” For 18 months, we lost nobody in Afghanistan. And then we had that horrible, horrible withdrawal where we lost 13 soldiers, 38 horribly wounded, left Americans behind. You have Americans right now still behind. Call them hostages, if you like. It was a terrible moment. We left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful equipment behind jets and tanks, and everything you can think of, goggles, night goggles. They didn’t use to fight. They’re good fighters. They didn’t use to fight at night. But now, they do because they have goggles. They have better goggles than we have.\n",

We have millions of people invading our country. This is an invasion. This is the worst invasion probably. We’ve never had anything like it. No country has ever had anything like it. The number today could be 15 million people, and they’re coming from rough places and dangerous places, and we had that shut down. We had everything going so beautifully. When Joe Biden goes to the beach because somebody on his staff thinks he looks very good in a bathing suit, until he can’t get his feet out of the sand or lift the chair, which weighs about nine ounces.\n",

And now, they say, “Well, I guess that was pretty good because we took in much more revenues after we cut taxes.” And then we did all of those regulation cuts, and people were working and everybody was happy, and we were all proud of our country, but we’re going to win this election because we have no choice. If we lose the election, we’re not going to have a country though. And we are going to do something. Thank you very much. \n",

They’ve been treated terribly and very unfairly and you know that and everybody knows that, and we’re going to be working on that sooner. The first day we get into office, we’re going to save out country and we’re going to work with the people to treat those unbelievable patriots, and they were unbelievable patriots and are. You see the spirit just cheering? They’re cheering while they’re doing that and they did that in prison and it’s a disgrace in my opinion.\n",

But I’m thrilled to be back with the proud, hardworking patriots of the great state of Ohio. I won this state and you won this state. But before going any further, I want to express our love for everyone touched by the terrible tornadoes that hit your state. They really hit it hard. Our hearts are with the families that lost a home or loved ones and it’s a very serious situation going on right now. So we are all praying for them and I know everybody here, this is a very big crowd, and I know everybody here feels the same way.\n",

      "As you know, this has been something very important to us. We see people in trouble. They’re really people in trouble. We’re going to help people in trouble. Right now our country’s in trouble and we’re going to help our country that’s in trouble and we’re going to make it great again and we’re going to do it very fast. So, as you know, this has been an incredible week for our campaign, unbelievable week. On Tuesday, we won Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Washington, and we won them in record numbers, by the way. I mean the numbers are crazy. What the hell is going on? Something’s going on here because nobody’s ever seen, they’ve never seen numbers like this. You know what it is? They see how bad these people are that are destroying our country. That’s what it is. And that’s, in my opinion, what it really is. And we clinched a thing called the Republican nomination for President of the United States. And to all Republicans, independents, and disillusioned Democrats, of which there are many, I invite you to join our movement to save our country and we’re going to save our country. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country and I was saying the other day that in 2016, one of the biggest issues was the border. And I sort of won on the border, I guess, maybe. And we fixed the border. We fixed it so good that I couldn’t even use it in 2020, even though we got millions and millions more votes in 2020, but we couldn’t even talk about it. I’d say, “I want to talk about the border. Tell them what a good job.” They said, “Sir, you fixed it. Nobody cares.” That border was a tiny fraction of what this border is. This is the worst border in the history of the world. There’s never been anything, millions and millions of people are pouring into our country, probably 15 or 16 million people. That’s almost larger than any state we have in the union.\n",

What these people have done to our country, it’s almost hard to believe frankly. The fastest way to reverse every single Biden disaster is to very simply just put me back in office. We’ll get it done quick. We’ll get it done very quickly. We want to have a rock-solid majority in the Senate. We want to take over the House. We have incredible people here with us today. Some great leaders and leaders that have been warriors for me, and that’s why we want to follow up our historic victory this week. That was a great victory, the biggest and the fastest ever. It’s never been won that quick. We moved very quickly. We got very tough in the end, didn’t we? We had no choice. We wanted to get a little tough to get it over with and we got it over with.\n",

It’s like an eternity when you have people that are incompetent running your country into the ground. But if we could, we’re going to take that victory and we’re going to add to it with Bernie Marino, who’s a fantastic guy. Bernie is a fantastic guy. He’s getting some very tough Democrat fake treatment right now, and we’re not going to stand for it because I know this man. We all know this man. He’s a hero. He’s a winner. And we are not going to let these people. These people are sick between Russia, Russia, Russia for two years and Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, 51 intelligence agents. I want one after another, one would stop and then they’d lie again.

Max was with me for four years, a great congressman and Bernie, I heard you’re doing really well. I heard you had a great poll today. You got to win, Bernie. Don’t leave me alone. Don’t leave me alone, Bernie. But Ohio needs to defeat your horrendous radical-left Democrat, Senator Sherrod Brown, who pretends he’s my best friend. He pretends he’s my best friend until he gets in, and then he goes radical-left all the time. If you listen to his commercials, he sounds like he’s running with Trump. He’s not. He’s not.\n",

And the day he gets out, he votes with Biden all the time. And if you vote with Biden, this country is finished. I’ll tell you right now. And we have to elect Bernie to get in there and to seal our border. Stop inflation, crush the Deep State. We started that when we got rid of Comey. Drill, baby, drill and prevent World War III.\n",

Also, he uses the Justice Department, the FBI to go after his political opponent. Happens to be me. How are we doing? And he’s driven my numbers through the roof. Do it one or two more times. How about a couple more indictments, Joe, you dumb son of a… You dumb son of a… Somebody said, “They’re indicting this guy into the office of president,” but they’ve never done that in this country before. That’s never happened. But we are going to discuss that. The nice thing we have, it’s a beautiful day, a little windy out here I must be honest with you, but that’s okay. It’s good when you don’t have to use a teleprompter because I can’t read a word on. They’re moving around. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing up here, Bernie, these suckers are moving. My guys did a great job in planting them solidly. Thank goodness we can do a non-teleprompter speech. It’s actually much better. But these teleprompters, they’re moving around. I’m trying to go… I’m trying to… No, we don’t need them. Isn’t it nice to have a president who doesn’t need a teleprompter? Isn’t that nice? These suckers are moving around. Great job, fellas.

You’ve been a terrible president.” He’s a terrible president. He’s the worst president we’ve ever had. There’s never been a president so bad as this guy. There’s never been anything like it. He’s incompetent. He’s crooked. He doesn’t know what the hell he is doing. Can’t walk off a stage. Can’t put two sentences together. He’s a disaster for our country. I say it. I say it a lot.

They raided my house and once he did that, I said, “Well, I guess that game is over.” Nobody thought it was possible. In fact, even the lunatics over at CNN and MSDNC, they would say, “Well no, these aren’t crimes.

You have vicious crimes, you have violent crimes, you have all these, now we have migrant crimes and they’re rough. They’re rough and it’s going to double up. And you see what’s happening. Throughout the world right now, I don’t know if you know this, crime is way, way down. You know why? Because they sent us their criminals. That’s why. It’s true. It’s true. They sent, do you know Venezuela is down 66% because they sent us their gang members and their gangsters. They sent us their drug dealers and their murderers. They’re all coming into our country and Venezuela now, their crime is down 66%. And all over the world, crime is down because they’ve sent them to the United States of America because we have a stupid president that allows this to happen. Stupid. Thank goodness we have JD here. That’s all I can tell you. Boy. Hi, JD. We have Jim Jordan, we have the heavyweights, we have Jim. We have the whole group. Wow, that’s exciting. Now, Jim Jordan doesn’t mind the fact that they’ve sent us all their murders. He’s very liberal. You know that. He thinks it’s, what? No. You know what? I’m looking at JD. I’m looking at these guys. They’re like seething as I talk, seething. They’re so angry. Think of it, all over the world, they’re smart people. I know many of the leaders. I got to know them very well. They’re smart. They’re tough. They’re streetwise. We have a man that can’t talk. He can’t even talk. He doesn’t know where the hell he is. He can’t find his way off a stage like this. Well, this one’s tougher because we only have four stairs and a long ramp. So this one I can understand, but he can’t find his way off a stage. Can’t do anything.

The Congo, last night, 22 people arrived from the Congo. Now, the Congo is a very nice place I would imagine, but they arrived from the Congo and they came from prison. Where are you from in the Congo? What’s your address? Prison. Now these are rough people. They’re coming from Africa, they’re coming from Asia, they’re coming from the Middle East, they’re coming from Yemen. All over the place from Yemen. I thought we were bombing Yemen.

When President Trump was president, we had none of this. Ukraine wouldn’t have been attacked. They wouldn’t be fighting with Russia.

One week ago I met with a family of 22-year-old nursing student, incredible person, Laken Riley, who was brutally murdered in Georgia last month while out on a morning run. She was so badly beaten up, unrecognizable, can you believe it?

Oh, I’m so sorry. I’d like to apologize,” to the killer. He’s more concerned with the killer. He couldn’t even pronounce her name right. He’s more concerned with the killer than he is with Laken. And that’s the problem.

Then she goes to court. Oh no, I’m not political. I’m not political at all. Then you have Bragg, the DA. So in the DA’s office, they didn’t trust Bragg, so they took their top person from the DOJ.

Think of this, we started with hundreds of millions of dollars the first couple of months, and I said, “This is pretty good.” We ended up taking in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Not one president ever took in 10 cents. They never asked them for anything. And we were rocking and rolling, and we were doing great. We had the greatest economy ever.\n",

We did something that nobody… Because of guys like Jim Jordan we had to get it passed through Congress, and we got it passed through Congress, and that was a big deal. We fully rebuilt the US military and we created Space Force. And I was the first president in decades who started no new wars except I brought our troops back home. We had no new wars, but we defeated ISIS. Everybody said it couldn’t be done. We did it very quickly. And we have a great military, I’ll tell you. I saw that with ISIS. Once I let them go, I said, “Go ahead, fellas. Do what you have to do. General Raisin Caine. “What’s your name?” “General Raisin, Sir.” “What’s your last name?” “Caine.” I said, “Your name’s Raisin Caine. I love you. This is what I’ve been looking for.

That’s what we need. Peace through strength. And I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay 100% or 200% tariff, which they do, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100% or 200%. In other words, you screw us and we’ll screw you. It’s very simple, very fair. We don’t do that. And as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families will go very substantially down and will bring businesses back to our country because want to avoid paying the tariffs. It’s very simple. It’s what other countries do to us. And I had it going. And then we had the gift from China, the COVID come in. We did a phenomenal job in that. Never got the credit, always got the credit for the military, always got the credit for ISIS, and so many things. Always got the credit for the economy and for no inflation.\n",

And when I left office, our stock market was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in, which is a tremendous achievement. We would’ve gone down the tubes. That would’ve been a 1929. And speaking of 1929, there are some brilliant Wall Street analysts like Scott and some others, but very brilliant Wall Street analysts that say, “The only thing good right now about our economy is the stock market. And the only reason that that’s good is because people think that Trump is going to be elected president. And if they ever thought that he wasn’t, you would end up with a crash, the likes of which we haven’t seen since 1929.” So they can take that the way they want.

I used to sit back and look at these deals. I said, “Who could have negotiated these deals?” They were so one-sided. We changed them all.

So, as you know, this has been an incredible week for our campaign, unbelievable week. On Tuesday, we won Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Washington, and we won them in record numbers, by the way. I mean the numbers are crazy. What the hell is going on? Something’s going on here because nobody’s ever seen, they’ve never seen numbers like this. You know what it is? They see how bad these people are that are destroying our country. That’s what it is. And that’s, in my opinion, what it really is. And we clinched a thing called the Republican nomination for President of the United States. And to all Republicans, independents, and disillusioned Democrats, of which there are many, I invite you to join our movement to save our country and we’re going to save our country. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country and I was saying the other day that in 2016, one of the biggest issues was the border. And I sort of won on the border, I guess, maybe. And we fixed the border. We fixed it so good that I couldn’t even use it in 2020, even though we got millions and millions more votes in 2020, but we couldn’t even talk about it. I’d say, “I want to talk about the border. Tell them what a good job.” They said, “Sir, you fixed it. Nobody cares.” That border was a tiny fraction of what this border is. This is the worst border in the history of the world. There’s never been anything, millions and millions of people are pouring into our country, probably 15 or 16 million people.

It’s good when you don’t have to use a teleprompter because I can’t read a word on. They’re moving around. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing up here, Bernie, these suckers are moving.

This is all about November 5th, the most important day, I believe. I really believe this. I used to say in 2016, “This is going to be the most important vote.” I didn’t say that in 2020 because we had the country going really well. In fact, we had a statement, “Keep America great.” It was going to replace MAGA. In a certain way I’m glad it didn’t because MAGA is MAGA. It’s always going to be MAGA as opposed to KAG. But it was Keep America Great and America was great. We made it great. And then we had a bad election. A horrible, horrible thing happened, because…\n",

      "Well, you know, a lot of people have been asking me that. And many people said you shouldn’t do them, but you see the polls have come out and I’m leading by 50 and 60 points. And some of them are at one and zero and two. And I’m saying, “Do I sit there for an hour or two hours?” Whatever it’s going to be, and get harassed by people that shouldn’t even be running for president? Should I be doing that?\n",

      "(00:47)\n",
      "It reminded me very much of 2016. In 2016, I went through the same stuff and had to fight them all the way. And then they became very friendly after I won or just about when I was winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "(00:58)\n",
      "But I just felt it would be more appropriate not to do the debate. I don’t think it’s right to do it if you’re leading by 50, 60. I have one poll leading by 70 points and I’m saying, “Why am I doing it?” And I’m going to have eight people, 10 people, whoever made the debate. I don’t know how many it is, but I’m going to have all these people screaming at me, shouting questions at me, all of which I love answering, I love doing, but it doesn’t make sense to do them. So I’ve taken a pass, as you probably noticed.\n",

      "Well, according to a poll that I guess we just saw. It just came out where it’s down like 30, 35%. But I think they were talking, referring to cable. I think cable’s down because it’s lost credibility. MSNBC, or as they say MSDNC is so bad. It’s so wrong. What they write and what they do and what they say. It’s fake news, as I said. I think I came up with that term. I hope I did. It’s a good one. It’s not tough enough anymore. It’s corrupt news. Really, what you do is called corrupt news. But somehow that doesn’t play as nicely. But it is corrupt news.\n",

I think it was a terrible move getting rid of you, you were number one on television, and all of a sudden you’re… We’re doing this interview, but we’ll get bigger ratings using this crazy forum that you’re using than probably the debate or competition.\n",

A guy like Chris Christie, a guy left with a 8%, think of it, 8% approval rating in New Jersey. Now he’s running for president? And he runs solely on the basis, “Oh, let’s get Trump.” He’s like a savage maniac. He’s like a lunatic. And that’s all he talks about. His poll numbers are very, very low. He is about 2%.\n",

      "Well, I’ve been friendly with him over the years, but I couldn’t give him a job because I just never trusted him very much. I was just never one of his people that really trusted him. I never gave him the job. And that’s one of the reasons he feels so hurt and so betrayed. And I understand that. I really do. I understand it. But I never gave him… He wanted to be different things. He was looking at different elements of the administration, and we decided, I decided just I didn’t want to do it. And now I’m glad I did because you see.\n",

I say that with respect to the Bush family, but they were Bushies, and it doesn’t work out for us.\n",

There are many people, I think you’re one of them, right? But a lot of people think that he was killed. He knew a lot on a lot of people.\n",

When that’s exposed, and they go down, and Barr should have gone after them, and other people should have gone after them. And they did, very late, because the Durham report came out. It was fairly good. It could have been a lot tougher, I guess, but it was fairly good. But it explained how corrupt it was.\n",

We got many millions of… We got millions and millions more votes. It wasn’t even a contest. People said, “Well, what’d you think of ’20?” I said, “We did much better.” We did. You got to base it on the number of votes. We got many more votes in ’20 than we did in ’16.\n",

But we had judges that didn’t want to look. We had people, didn’t want to get involved. They would say, they told you, “She’s a conspiracy theorist,” if you say anything about the election.\n",

But he’s a corrupt person. So corrupt that I took the name off Hillary. I don’t do two people at one time. I took the Crooked Hillary and I made it, I retired the name. That was a good day for her.

He can’t lift his feet out of the grass. It’s only two inches at the White House, right? It’s not a lot. But you watch him and it looks like he’s walking on toothpicks.

South Korea spent billions on the Olympics. Nobody was going to go. They didn’t want to get blown up. They called me and they said, “We are going to let the Olympics proceed.

When I look at San Francisco, what’s happened to that incredible city, that was one of the greatest cities in the world just a short while ago and now it’s very sad when you look at it, Los Angeles.

They’re emptying out their prisons all over South America. They’re emptying out their mental institutions. Terrorists are pouring into our country. We have no idea.\n",

In fact, if you check with the authorities on the border, we built almost 500 miles of wall. I had another 200 that I was going to build. It’s like water, it seeks. We’re going to build another 200. We built it, it was all set to go, all they had to do is install it. It would’ve taken three weeks. That’s when I found out, I said, “I think these people actually want open borders.” The first thing I would do would be, I would seal up the border good and tight, except for people that want to come in legally.\n",

      "So we built a thing called the Panama Canal. We lost 35,000 people to the mosquito, malaria. We lost 35,000 people because of the mosquito. Vicious. They had to build under nets. It was one of the true great wonders of the world. As he said, one of the nine wonders of the world. No, no, it was one of the seven. It just happened a little while ago. He says nine wonders of the world. You could make nine wonders. He would’ve been better off if he stuck with a nine and just said, “Yeah, I think it’s nine.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But this is one of the true seven wonders of the world. And you take a look at the Panama Canal, it was such an incredible engineering marvel. We sold it under Jimmy Carter. We sold it to Panama for $1. The following day they quadrupled the amount of money that ships had to pay to get across. They didn’t lose one ship. Now they’ve made it much bigger. Now they’ve widened it. They’ve doubled it, right? They’ve more than doubled it. It’s one of the most profitable things. It’s just incredible. Right? We gave it away for $1.\n",

      "China now controls it. They actually control the Panama Canal. They run it, they control it, and we shouldn’t let that happen. We can’t let China be in Cuba. They’ll get out. If I’m president, they’ll get out. Because I had a very good relationship with President Xi. He respected this country. He respected me and he’ll get out. We can’t let them run the Panama Canal. We built the Panama Canal. Should have never been given to Panama. We should have had it, but we gave it for $1. Think of it. \n",
      "They quadrupled. In one day, they lifted the fees, which are pretty big for these massive ships to go through rather than going around the cape and through all the tremendous storms. Such beauty. It’s beautiful stuff, but you didn’t want to get caught in those storms. Those were storms that wiped out the biggest ships.\n",

We have done the stupidest things in this country and now we have a president that can’t put two sentences together, can’t speak, can’t walk, can’t talk. I don’t think he gets to the starting gate. But these people do miracles. I mean, he ran out of his basement and you got away with that one because of COVID, so he sort of got away with it. They cheated on the election.\n",

The Democrat Convention, the last one they had voter ID that was this big. It looked like a prison card this big on their chest. You walked in, they had your picture, your this, your fingerprint. They had everything. The most incredible voter ID I’ve ever seen. That was to get into the Democrat National Convention. But to get in to vote, if you buy groceries, if you buy practically anything now, you have ID on a card, credit cards or otherwise.\n",

France did it. France had mail-in ballots and it was terrible. Anytime you have mail- in ballots, you’re going to have massive cheating on your elections. Anytime. Not just the presidential election. Anytime you have-\n",

Yeah, they have to cheat because their policies are so bad that if they didn’t cheat, they couldn’t get elected. Who wants open borders? Who wants high taxes? Who wants high interest rates? Who wants to not be able to use a gas stove or have to drive an electric car? Which you have a four-hour drive, but the car only goes an hour and a half. You have to charge it.\n",

It’s got to go wherever it goes into the oceans, whatever. It’s not like a big problem. Now in some states they have a problem. You have some desert areas and all, and for that it’s okay. But they have sinks where no water comes out. You turn it on, no water comes out. No water comes out of the shower. No water is allowed to go into the washing machine for your dishes or for your clothing. And I avoided all of that.\n",

It usually takes place in new hotels and new homes.\n",

And they were really doing badly because people were dumping washing machines all over, mostly from South Korea, but also from China. And he was explaining, “It’s just a terrible situation.” I said, “Let me ask you, how’s the quality” He says, “We’re better, but they are good enough quality.” But of course he’s going to say that, but they are better. He said, “But they don’t allow us. They’re dumping these machines. They’re cutting us in half. They’re killing us. And on top of it, the government won’t let us use water in our machines.” I mean, he shows me like a quarter of a bottle of water that’s supposed to be washing clothing.\n",

You understand because when they have a 10-year term, there is a question. I fired Comey. That was a great thing. If I didn’t fire Comey, maybe I wouldn’t be talking to you or I’d be talking to you about real estate or something else other than politics. That was a coup, in my opinion.

The insurance policy, she’s going to win 100 million to one. That’s not good odds. At least they gave me one, right? 100 million to one. But just in case she doesn’t win, we have an insurance policy.

I said, “Is he a human conveyor belt?” I mean, if he finds fraud in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in any of these states, Arizona, he has to send them to Mitch McConnell, right? That’s right, sir. Well, if he finds fraud, he has to … Yes, sir. I said, “So he’s a conveyor belt.” Well, put him in. I said, “I don’t agree with that.” And we had some lawyers, not all, we had some lawyers that said, “No, you do have the right to send them back to the legislatures to be rechecked.” Because if you looked at what went on in Wisconsin, who by the way, now agree with me, Wisconsin has been virtually, other than the fact they’re not allowed to do anything statutorily, but Wisconsin, what they found is incredible.

He said, “We will keep the votes of the great state of Georgia for Thomas Jefferson and his president.” I didn’t ask him for that. Could have done that too. But I thought that would be turmoil.

There were other lawyers that felt you could do it. It was one of those things. He probably… I think he could have done it. I think you can always do something if you see fraud or if you see problems. But, it’s very interesting. After the election was over, the Rhinos got together with the Democrats, and they redid the election so you couldn’t do it anymore.\n",

So when that happened, I said, “Wow.” You look some of these Democrats in the eye and they’d say, “He has absolutely no right to do it.” Immediately after the election, they met Rhinos, can name them all, and Democrats.

Basically, she’s saying, “Trump doesn’t have the right to criticize an election.” But you’ve been around long enough now, you’ve seen many elections criticized. Hillary Clinton goes crazy. Every time she talks she says, “He’s not the President.” Jimmy Carter said, “He’s not the President.” Well, I am the President.

We’d go to Wisconsin, and we’d go to Georgia, we’d go to different states, and Michigan, we’d have rallies. In Pennsylvania, we had 58,000 people in Butler. I said, “How are we losing this?” How do you have a rally where you have from 50,000 to 100,000 people, many of them? I did seven a day for a couple of days. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. These are big rallies too, and I didn’t hold back. I didn’t say, “Let’s do abbreviations.” But, they challenged the stuff. Hillary called me up and conceded.

With that being said, I had great support when they did impeachment hooks number one, and impeachment hooks number two. Jim Jordan, the House was fantastic. Actually, the Senate was very good for me, other than Mitch McConnell. I think if he had… It’s too bad, I endorsed him. He was begging. He was going to lose that race, and I endorsed him, and he ended up winning the race because of my endorse… He was down. He was going to lose too Amy McGrath, $90 million in cash, all set to go. She was leading by three. He was going down. I did him a favor. Then three, four months later, he freely wanted to impeach me. He’s a bad guy.\n",

With that being said, I’ve had great loyalty also. But the House was fantastic. The Senate was very good. They overrode Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell, in my opinion, was trying to get senators to impeach me, especially for the second one. On the first one, he acted very, very slow. He should have gone much faster. But Mitch McConnell wanted to. The senators went up to him, guys that are subservient to him because he gives him money. He gives him a lot of money.

We had 149 countries represented, Tucker, from places that many people never even heard of, coming into our country. They’re coming in from mental institutions, and they’re coming in from prisons.

We built it, it was all set to go, all they had to do is install it. It would’ve taken three weeks.

You know who kept you first in the nation, Steve? It’s Trump. But I just want to tell you first in the nation, you’re always going to be first in the nation.

Do you know that Afghanistan is one of now the top two or three leading sellers of military equipment anywhere in the world because they don’t need 700,000 rifles. 700,000, Al, rifles and guns. They don’t need 70,000 vehicles. Many of them armor-plated. Boy, somebody was a good buyer. Can you imagine? We didn’t need it either to win. I wiped out ISIS and we did it rapidly. It was supposed to take five years. I did it in four or five weeks. And we didn’t have to get a lot of new equipment. We just wiped out ISIS. But incredibly, Nikki is defending her planned cuts for social security and Medicare. She wants to mess around with social security and Medicare. You don’t deserve it. Especially senior citizens, you don’t deserve it and we’re not going to let it happen. Perhaps worst of all, Nikki Haley is backed by the deep state and the military industrial complex.

We got to help ourselves first. Our country is in horrible distress because they know she’s a globalist and can be easily manipulated to obtain and send hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine. And I want to help Ukraine too. But here’s the problem, Europe, which is approximately our size as an economy when you add up all the countries, and I got them to pay… They’re not in love with me.

And I’ll never forget, the leader of one of the 28 countries at the time stood up, said, “Does that mean if we’re not paid up, you’re not going to protect us?” I said, “That’s exactly what it means.” And the following day, billions and billions of dollars came pouring in.\n",

That’s what I used to do. And when they knocked down those buildings, you have a lot of people living in those buildings and the numbers are going to be far greater when you see the end. And those cities are being obliterated, those domes, those golden, beautiful, ancient domes and all of the architecture, it’s all obliterated. It should have never happened. Nobody should have been killed. Zero chance Putin would’ve done it with me there. He wouldn’t have done it. I talked to him.

Same thing if you look at the current version is Iran. Iran was broke with me. I told China and every other country, “If you buy oil from Iran, you’re not doing any more business with the United States.

Biden goes to the beach a lot, because he’s got consultants that say, “You look great in a bathing suit.” You ever see him in the beach?

He’s so handsome that he’s going to be on the beach as much.” If he would’ve gone to the beach, and the problem is those chairs? They’re like light aluminum now, right? A child can lift them.

This was a song, actually, a long time ago, and I sort of changed it around a little bit. It just reminded me of our border and what’s happening. I do this, and people think it’s good, but most people that are smart say, “Boy, that’s a problem, because this is what’s happening to our country at the border.” On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in, and I’ll take care of you.” Have you heard this before? And how much do you love it, right?\n",

They have no drug problem at all. They make drugs for us, okay? That’s what their problem is. That’s our problem more because I think the real number is 300,000. That’s 300,000 deaths, destruction of families. When you lose a child, when something like this happens, the family can never ever recover from that. They can never ever be the same.

We will cast out the communists, Marxists and fascists. We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will route the news media, the fake news. We can’t stand the fake news. And we’ll evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House, the worst president in history by far. And we’re going to have an election day in 2024 that you will be so proud of. We’re going to make our country so powerful, so great, so strong, so safe. The great silent majority is rising like never before, and under our leadership, the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. They weren’t forgotten for four years. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, New Hampshire. Thank you. Go out and vote. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.\n",

      "Well, thank you very much. You think that’s an easy trip? That’s not an easy trip. We came through that cold and everything. Although, I must say 40 below zero in a place called Iowa, that’s pretty good. But the result was worth it, wasn’t it? And those are great people. And they are, they’re just great people, and you’re great people. The whole country’s loaded up with great people, and they’re tired of seeing the failure and the death the destruction. And we’re going to turn it around. Hello, New Hampshire. Hello. Very much, I love you, New Hampshire. I’m thrilled to be back in the home of first in the nation. You know who kept you first in the nation, Steve? It’s Trump. But I just want to tell you first in the nation, you’re always going to be first in the nation. There’s another party that doesn’t want you to be there. And we put you there and I said I was going to keep you there. And we kept you there.\n",

We said, “Well, if we got 30 or 35, it would be good.” And we get 52, 53, we had a great time and we had a great time with a lot of friends up there. And we did a lot for the farmers. We gave them $28 billion, farmer, from China. Do you think Biden worries about China? Look at my man, my great veteran friend. How are you? Okay? \n",
      "We’ve been fighting for the veterans ever since I’ve known you, which is at the beginning, from the first day, right? Thank you. Thank you. We did a good job for the vets, you said. And with your vote, four days from now, we’re going to win another historic victory in the great state of New Hampshire, and then we’re going to defeat Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country, and we’re going to make America great again. So the primer is this Tuesday, January 23rd. So if you want to send a message straight to Crooked Joe and all of his thugs and frauds destroying our country… They are destroying. I mean, what they’re doing on the border, what they did with Afghanistan, how they could let this happen to Ukraine with Russia. None of this stuff… Inflation wouldn’t have happened. The attack on Israel wouldn’t have happened. None of it would’ve happened. It’s just such a sad, sad thing to see. But you need to get every patriot and get them out to vote in record numbers. We got to get record numbers.\n",

      "When I was in Iowa last week, I’d made a lot of different stops and speeches and everything. Every time I’m there, I said, “Just don’t believe the polls,” because it had us up 40 or 50 points or something. I said, “You got to get out because margins are important,” not because of the people were running. He had Sinicki. I don’t even talk about DeSantis. Whatever happened to him? Well, no, a poll just came out. DeSantis is at four. What happened to this guy? One of the great self-destructions I think I’ve ever witnessed. Steve, what do you think? And she ain’t doing too good either. She’s down very low. She’s down very low. But we’ll finish it off. This could end it. Get the big vote, it ends it. This could end it. We end it. And then we could focus on the worst president. Then we could focus on Biden and his thugs.\n",

From the very first day that we take back the White House from Biden and his people, the radical left lunatics, I call them, I believe… And they are radical left. Look what I have to go through. Whoever thought I’d run for office and it ended up being indicted more than Alphonse Capone? Okay? They say, “Oh, he’s challenging the election,” which happened to be right about 100%, by the way, and everyone knows that. It was a rigged election. And for challenging election, they indict you. These are bad people. They indict the political opponent because they have nothing else. They have the worst record probably in history. In fact, you’ve heard me say this. Jimmy Carter is a happy man today, because his presidency is brilliant by comparison to Biden. It’s a brilliant presidency. Congratulations. Now, this is the worst, most dangerous. And he is a threat to democracy for a number of reasons.\n",

Using DOJ to win an election is a threat to democracy. So I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years in the history of the country. I also think that when you look at how bad the economy is in some ways, but the stock market holds up, because every time I have good poll numbers, if you take a look, the stock market’s going up. The stock market thinks we’re going to win. That’s the only reason the stock market’s up. And if something would happen, I tell you, I honestly believe you’d have a crash like in 1929. That’s what I believe.\n",

      "The stock market is up for two reasons, actually. They’re running on the fumes of what we did. We had the greatest economy ever in the history of this country. And they think we’re going to win. And if we win, the stock market’s going to go through the roof. But they think we’re going to win, and I think that’s why it’s up. But we will quickly cut New Hampshire energy prices in half or even more. So you don’t know, because you have a governor who’s… Honestly, he’s terrible, this guy. I watch him. He’s all over the place. He ran for president, you know that. He didn’t announce it because he didn’t have the guts, right? But he ran for president and he didn’t exactly… His numbers were in the vicinity of Asa Hutchinson. No, they were so bad. And instead of announcing like you’re supposed to do, you’re supposed to run, you announce the running. And if you do well, great. And if you don’t do well, that’s fine too. What are you going to do? Right?\n",

That’s okay with me, Chris. Because this guy is bad news. This guy is bad news for the… I don’t want to bring it back. I never want to have it back. I’ll take good care of New Hampshire. I always have. You don’t need this guy. This guy is bad. He’s bad. He’s bad. But he ran for president. He ran for president. He went crazy. And so on every show, I said, the only thing I respected, I didn’t know how he could get from one studio to… I’ve never seen anything like it. And you know what? He ran so much that people realize they don’t like him very much. It was crazy.\n",

She’s not tough enough. She’s not smart enough, and she wasn’t respected enough. She cannot do this job. She’s not going to be able to deal with President Xi. She’s not going to be able to deal with Putin and Kim Jong Un, and all of the very fine people you have to deal with. And she will not be able to do the job. And we have to tell her to leave social security a lot because she wants to wipe out your social security. We’re not going to let that happen.

      "Again, in Iowa, we had such a result. And a lot of people said, “You can’t get more than 40.” And all of a sudden, these numbers came in. In fact, it was a little embarrassing. I had to go at the very beginning, 7:00, right at the beginning, it opens at 7:00, and I heard the results come out at 10:00. So I get up and made a little speech to the, in that case, the caucus goers, and I made a speech, a nice little speech, lasted for about two minutes. And I walk off the stage just 10 after 7:00, something like that. “Sir, congratulations. You’ve won.” I said, “I’ve won what?” I didn’t know what the hell they were talking about. “Al,” I said, “What did I win?” And they said, “You won the caucus, the Iowa caucus.” I said, “What time is it?” I said, “Those must be very good numbers.” And interesting, so Ron DeSanctimonious, he was very upset because he hadn’t gone on to make his speech.\n",

It’s hard to go up and make an inspirational speech when you know lost, right? I don’t know what he did. Did anybody follow what he did after that? But we’re going to bring America together through unprecedented success. That’s what happens. Success will bring our country together because our country’s a mess right now. And success… She said, “Forget success. You’ll bring it together.” Who is that? Oh, look. Front-row Joes we have here. It’s front-row Joes. That’s so cute. These are great people. They’ve come to 190 rallies. And I hear I have the young ladies from North Carolina. Oh, look at them. So they’re at about 100. These beautiful women from North Carolina.

Would anybody like to give up their spot? Well, you’re from… Hey, you are from a certain part of the world, New Hampshire, there’s no way you would give up your spot. Do you know how well you fought? I was reading something of the Civil War. They said the people from New Hampshire were very tough fighters. Did you know that history? The people from New Hampshire were very tough fighters. You won a lot of battles. That was a nasty war. Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate… That’s 118 times. But I think the front-row Joes have you beat. I think they have you beat.

People with diplomas from the great Wharton School of Finance like me, people with diplomas, that don’t have diplomas, people with no high school diploma, everybody. Every single group had the best numbers, and this country was coming together and nobody believed how it was. We had gasoline prices at $1.87 a gallon. There was no inflation. There was no inflation. But now under Biden, the most corrupt president, the worst president… I never used to talk this way about him. I’d joke, I’d … But once I got indicted, I said, “Oh, this guy is really a bad guy.” So now I say it like it is. He’s grossly incompetent. He’s the most incompetent president and the most corrupt president we’ve ever had. Because once they do the indictment stuff, and once they do that… I got indicted four times. Remember, Al Capone didn’t come close to that. That was the one thing. When I fly over a blue state, two days later, I get a subpoena.\n",

We’re leading by numbers that nobody’s ever seen. In Iowa, we broke the record by double. And there is a theory out there. I actually believe we would’ve been leading by a lot, but we wouldn’t be leading by this number. Had they left us alone, had they just left us alone, I’d be leading, but not by the numbers that we’re seeing where we set a record that nobody’s ever thought was even possible. And you know the funny thing? If they would’ve played straight… They’re not, and that includes the fake news because the fake news is terrible. But if they would’ve played straight, just think about this because I’ve never said this before. I was just thinking as I’m standing up here, because then unlike this other guy, I can think from the stage, he can’t. He can’t. Can’t find his way off the stage.\n",

I just thought of that. So you people back there from North Carolina, you can come and watch for another four years of this stuff. But isn’t that great? I’m just thinking. We’d be just about wrapping it up saying we had a great… But here’s the advantage. We wouldn’t have Russia attacking Ukraine. We wouldn’t have inflation. We wouldn’t have the attack on Israel. Kim Jong Un of North Korea wouldn’t be threatening us with the nuclear missiles again. China wouldn’t be even thinking about Taiwan. We would have the greatest economy ever and we wouldn’t have had inflation. Other than that, I’d say it’s about even, okay? But none of these things would’ve happened. Inflation was caused by stupid energy policy. None of this stuff would’ve happened. So it’s really sad. But we’re going to do something.\n",

      "And mortgage rates. Mortgage rates at an all-time high. And with me, they hit an all-time low. That’s a pretty big difference. We had the lowest mortgage rates ever recorded. And they have among the worst. So we could go over plenty more too, if you want to know. And now under Biden, everybody is poor. The typical family has lost over $7,500 a year thanks to Crooked Joe’s inflation. Inflation is a country-buster. It busts up countries. Germany years ago. Any country where it has… Yeah, sit down  so they see in the back. That’s okay. You’ll be attending up in about two seconds. It’s always nice when you say, “Sit down,” and then about 12 seconds later, the whole place is standing up. No, that’s an honor. I mean, it really is. It’s an honor. It’s an honor. It’s like when I endorse people, they win. Almost 99%, they win when we endorse… And I consider that a great honor.\n",

That MAGA, they’re bad people.” I say, “What does MAGA mean?” “I don’t know what it means. What exactly… It means Make America Great Again. That’s all it means. Very simple. Very simple to understand that, Joe. Under Trump, everybody was richer. The typical family saw their income grow $6,000 a year plus. We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts in American history. We did regulation cuts that were the largest, but we did tax cuts that were substantially larger… Thank you. We were substantially larger than Ronald Reagan. That’s pretty good, right? And he did good, but we did even better.\n",

He’s always working in Washington, DC. But he came to see me and he had this idea for opportunity zones. And it’s bringing in now tens of billions of dollars, no investment. The country doesn’t have to do anything. It just gives incentives to people to work in areas that would’ve been gone right now. And it’s one of the most successful economic development situations that we’ve ever gotten involved in. And Tim Scott is the one that came to see me about it. And I’m really thrilled to know that he may even be able to… We are going to try and get him. Oh, would I love to get him to endorse me, right? Do you think we could get him?

And I got to see them every couple of years, like clockwork, every year, and I got to know them a little bit. And I said, “Fellas, let me ask you a question. Why do you keep coming here?” He said, “Because they don’t give us the money and we need money.” And it wasn’t huge amounts compared to what you would think. And they’re great people. I got to know them very well. And they were just coming. One of them said, “We feel like beggars having to come back here to Washington to ask for money to keep our colleges going.” And other colleges, they have so much… Look at Harvard.

But I said to the college presidents, I said, “Fellas, I’m going to get you long-term financing and I’m going to get you more than you asked for.” And they didn’t believe because they’d been doing this for 25, 30 years. Every year, they come up and they ask for money for their colleges. And I got them more money than they wanted, more money than they asked for. I sat down with them. I said, “You need more money than that,” and they’re doing a great job. I said, “The only thing bad… I got them ten-year financing. They don’t have to come back to Washington. I said, “The only thing bad about it is I’ll probably never see you again. I’ll probably never see you again.” But I took care of the colleges and they take care of incredible numbers of great Black students and they do a fantastic job. And I was very honored. Nobody ever writes that stuff. So I talk about it myself a little bit because I feel I have to. But maybe that’s why we have the best numbers with African-Americans, best poll numbers that anybody’s seen in many, many decades, right? Many, many decades. They had a poll today, 28%. Now, 28% normally wouldn’t sound too good, but when a Mitt Romney, this character, he is not their guy, I can tell you. But Mitt Romney’s at four, 28’s very good. 28 is very good. I’d like to see a lot higher than that. They shouldn’t be going with the Democrats. The Democrats have been terrible to them, frankly. But we’re starting to find that out. But we had a fantastic poll. Hispanic, likewise… Hispanic, we’re over 50% in a lot of polls.\n",

He announced tonight he wants to cancel the election.” When I imitate Biden, he can’t find his way off a stage. He can’t put two sentences together, right? Can’t put two sentences together. He’s a teleprompter, he doesn’t know where the hell the teleprompter. It’s there. And the nice part about me, I only use the teleprompter. I think they say it averages about 9%. Wouldn’t it be nice if you had a guy that didn’t really need the teleprompter? Isn’t that nice though? Isn’t that nice? But the dangerous thing I have, Al and Steve, is when I joke a little bit. We got to joke, the country’s in such trouble. If you don’t have a sense of humor, we’d never get by. But you got to make a little bit of fun. And I imitate his speaking and I go, “” He has no idea where the hell he is. Right? Or I’ll show him when he can’t find the stairs. Now we have a stair there. We have a stair there. We have one here. We have one here… They’re all over the place. And he can never find this… I think Secret Service, you always have this young, handsome guy run onto the stage, grab his arm and pretend like it’s normal to be doing that. Right?

And she’s not doing… She’s not going to do the job, I can tell you. I had plenty of experience with her. She’s fine. She’s okay. She’s not bad, but she’s not going to do the job.

He’s the only one that doesn’t know it, actually, if you want to know. Our movement is pro borders, pro jobs, pro-freedom and pro-America. Pro-America. It’s very simple. The radical left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley for one reason: because she’s easy to beat. If you take a look at the poll, she’s the easiest one to beat.

But here are some of Nikki Haley and Ron DeSanctimonious’s toxic positions that make them totally unelectable. They’re unelectable. Nikki Haley said she wants to raise the retirement age to match life expectancy, which means that she wants to work your… You’re supposed to work your entire life.

Sadly, he’s hurt Fox. But he’s also hurt The New York Post. He’s hurt The Wall Street Journal. He’s a RINO, Paul Ryan. And he had the 2011 plan to destroy Medicare. Remember the same plan that led Democrat ads showing Republicans wheeling granny off the cliff. Remember granny? That was not a good ad for the Republicans. And he had a chance. He ran and he lost.

I see they’re starting another war. The same people that ran Afghanistan are going to run… We got a Secretary of Defense who’s running the war. They say he’s laying in a hospital bed.

I bought it. I rebuilt the entire military. I bought it and they gave it to the Taliban. Do you know that Afghanistan is one of now the top two or three leading sellers of military equipment anywhere in the world because they don’t need 700,000 rifles. 700,000, Al, rifles and guns. They don’t need 70,000 vehicles. Many of them armor-plated. Boy, somebody was a good buyer. Can you imagine? We didn’t need it either to win. I wiped out ISIS and we did it rapidly. It was supposed to take five years. I did it in four or five weeks. And we didn’t have to get a lot of new equipment. We just wiped out ISIS. But incredibly, Nikki is defending her planned cuts for social security and Medicare. She wants to mess around with social security and Medicare. You don’t deserve it. Especially senior citizens, you don’t deserve it and we’re not going to let it happen. Perhaps worst of all, Nikki Haley is backed by the deep state and the military industrial complex. She’s never seen a war she doesn’t like. She’s never seen a war she doesn’t like because they know she’s a globalist fool. These globalists are fools. We want to help the globe if possible. We got to help ourselves first. Our country is in horrible distress because they know she’s a globalist and can be easily manipulated to obtain and send hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine. And I want to help Ukraine too. But here’s the problem, Europe, which is approximately our size as an economy when you add up all the countries, and I got them to pay… They’re not in love with me.

By the end of the first meeting I said, “This is a real mess over here.” I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars into NATO. They weren’t paying for years. And I’ll never forget, the leader of one of the 28 countries at the time stood up, said, “Does that mean if we’re not paid up, you’re not going to protect us?” I said, “That’s exactly what it means.” And the following day, billions and billions of dollars came pouring in.\n",

That’s what I used to do. And when they knocked down those buildings, you have a lot of people living in those buildings and the numbers are going to be far greater when you see the end. And those cities are being obliterated, those domes, those golden, beautiful, ancient domes and all of the architecture, it’s all obliterated. It should have never happened. Nobody should have been killed. Zero chance Putin would’ve done it with me there. He wouldn’t have done it. I talked to him.

Same thing if you look at the current version is Iran. Iran was broke with me. I told China and every other country, “If you buy oil from Iran, you’re not doing any more business with the United States. It’s over.” In addition, any business that comes through, we’re putting a 100% tariff on it. And President Xi said, “Like I said, I won’t be buying oil from Iran.”\n",

Look, one of the reasons I did, because I happened to love the Lieutenant Governor Henry McMaster, South Carolina. Great. I said, “By moving her someplace, Henry McMaster becomes governor of South Carolina.” And by the way, he’s been a fantastic governor. Henry’s been a fantastic governor. So I did him a favor.

And they’ve been trying to do this for over 60 years, get the right, and they would say, “Well, if we injure them…” “They’re terminally ill,” I’d say. “If we injure, we may get sued.” So I devised a document, the drug company sued, they signed. Because the drug companies didn’t want to show bad results. So they were afraid to show bad results. I got them, we said, “We’re not going to show those results.

We’re taking back our country in November, and they have to know. So we want to win by big numbers. We don’t want to just win. We want to win by big, big numbers. So everybody has to go. From Manchester to Meredith, from Plymouth to Portsmouth, from Conway to Concord, you inherit the legacy of red-blooded New Hampshire patriots. That’s what you are who live by a very, very immortal motto. Do you know what that is? Live free or die.\n",

      "We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower, and strength. It’s very sad to say. We are a nation that has frankly lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country, and it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. You’re going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. 2024 is our final battle. It’s our final battle.\n",

We will cast out the communists, Marxists and fascists. We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will route the news media, the fake news. We can’t stand the fake news. And we’ll evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House, the worst president in history by far. And we’re going to have an election day in 2024 that you will be so proud of. We’re going to make our country so powerful, so great, so strong, so safe. The great silent majority is rising like never before, and under our leadership, the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. They weren’t forgotten for four years. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.

      "Well, thank you very much, this is a crowded place. And I just visited some overflow rooms, and you’re not in an overflow room, but this is crowded and outside you got a lot of people.\n",

      "But that’s like a poll, right? That’s like taking a poll when you get right down to it. So thank you very much and hello New Hampshire. We are really going to rock in New Hampshire and we’re going to have a little fun tonight and we can give you… This is the last speech if think of it. It’s a little sad, but we’ll be back a lot because we’re going to get your energy prices down.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:47)\n",
      "We’re going to get you energy down by I would say a solid 50% within one year. I promise. Tomorrow is the day that each and every one of you is going to cast the most important vote of your entire life. This is a very, very important vote. When you step into that voting booth, you are going to be signaling that we want crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country, we got to get him out, his radical left lunatics, the entire sick political establishment in our nation’s capital. We’re going to do things and we’re going to do things right. We’re going to bring our country back. With your vote you’re going to put crooked Joe and his protectors on notice that we are coming in November. We’re coming to take over the beautiful, beautiful White House and we’re going to run the country the way it’s supposed to be run, not the way it’s been [inaudible 00:03:45].\n",

      "We just got back from a beautiful, beautiful state, Iowa, and the expectations were good and we exceeded them by a lot, by a lot. We set records. It was actually a record in the history of the state, that was a record for what we were doing and everybody was a little bit surprised. They thought we were going to win by a lot, but we won by record stuff. Nobody has done better and we’re going to do that here. I believe we’re going to do that here.\n",

      "Now you do have to do one thing, you have to get the Democrats stop voting in a Republican primary. What’s that all about? You know what that is? That’s a weak governor. That’s a weak governor that would allow that. Democrats are not supposed to be voting in Republican primaries. Do we agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:45)\n",
      "But get out and vote. And I spent a lot of time in Iowa saying this. We had very big polls just like we do now. We just got some in, they’re fantastic polls, but assume you won down please, okay, and get out of bed and just get to vote. Grab your neighbor, grab everybody. You got to go out, because we have to win by big margins.\n",

      "(05:05)\n",
      "And the reason we have to do that, Al, very simple, do you know what the reason is in November, we have to send the signal that we’re not playing games. This country has gone to hell, this country has gone to hell. We have people pouring in our borders. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. Nobody knows where they’re from, unvetted, unchecked. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening to our country and you have to get out in numbers, even if you think we’re going to win big, and I think we are, but you’re going to have to show it and we want to have that so that come November we’re going to be in a position where people are not…\n",

      "And we have to stop the cheating. We’re going to stop the cheating. The one you know you win is when you swamp them, not drain the swamp, build up the swamp in this case. Tomorrow we’re going to win New Hampshire and then we’re going to defeat crooked Joe Biden and we are going to make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n",

      "(06:47)\n",
      "Every day the Republican Party is becoming more and more unified. Thank you very… That was a good job. Boy, that was quick. That took about nine seconds. Thank you. Every day the Republican Party is becoming more and more unified and it is, and you see what happened. I mean we had a very good competitor, Ron, as you know, Ron DeSantis, Ron DeSantis, and he fought hard and he fought well. And now we have one left. We started off with… Really if you add some Democrats into it, we started off with 13 and now we’re down to two people and I think one person will be gone probably tomorrow, and the other one will be gone in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:41)\n",
      "But now is the time for the Republican Party to come together. We have to unify. That’s why I’m delighted to be joined today by a number of outstanding leaders, big leaders, powerful leaders, greatly respected leaders, and they’re also unbelievable competitors. And we’re all on the same team. 100% focused on Biden and beating him in November.\n",

Vivek Ramaswamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much. Vivek; we love him, Dynamo. He’s a dynamo. So one of the most respected governors in the country, brilliant guy, made a lot of money and then he said, “Let me run for office,” we know about that, and he is truly from North Dakota and done really an incredible job. And he’s a friend of mine, become a friend of mine and a really good one, Doug Burgum.\n",

      "You’ll be seeing a lot of them, and we have another one. Everybody knows him. And today it was a big story, the biggest story out there. He’s engaged to be married. We never thought this was going to happen. What’s going on? A very, very fine person, a man that we worked so closely, and I worked so closely with. He was in the Senate. He’s been there now a long time and one of the most respected people in all of Washington. Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you fellas. Great people. They are great people. Thank you very much. That’s a great group of people. You’ll be seeing a lot of them.\n",

      "(15:07)\n",
      "Sadly, not everyone is willing to put our country first. Here in New Hampshire, Nikki Haley has made an unholy alliance with RINOs, never-Trumpers, Americans for no prosperity. Did you ever hear of them? Did you ever hear of them? Americans for no prosperity? I added the word, “No,” in. Globalists and radical left communists to get liberals and Biden supporters to vote for her and the Republican primary. You got a lot of Democrats voting for her. You have a crazy election. Let’s all get out and let’s vote for somebody that we want to run against.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:39)\n",
      "They want to run against because she’s so easy to beat. If you look at the polls, Biden beats her by a lot. We cannot have that. We cannot have gone this far and let that happen. The people behind Nikki Haley are pro-amnesty, pro-China, pro-open borders, pro-war, pro-deep state and pro-Biden. That’s not too good. RINO is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, that’s that’s true. Thank you. Thank you darling. Appreciate it. She just gave me a very good idea actually. Our movement is pro-borders, pro-jobs, pro-freedom and it’s really something that’s very common sense, 100% pro America. It’s very simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are the party of common sense, and that’s what we are. We’re conservative, we’re this… Who cares? We’re the party of… It’s all about common sense. It’s about strong borders, low taxes, great education, few regulations, and we had it all. We’ve never had an economy in history, in the history of our country we never had an economy so good as it was just a few years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:49)\n",
      "We never had a better border, a stronger border than we had. The radical-left Democrats are supporting Nikki for one simple reason because they know that she’s very easy to beat. And you see that with the polls that just came out tonight. We’re beating Biden by so much. Probably get indicted three or four more times by tomorrow. They’re going to indict, they’re going to keep indicting, and it keeps driving my numbers up. I can’t figure that one out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I believe she’s not electable. Nikki Haley wants to charge the working class a 23% national sales tax. Well, and you know that she wants to raise social security retirement age by approximately 10 years. Is that right? Approximately, so you can labor until the day you die and then not collect a penny of the benefits that you really have earned and you’ve paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:42)\n",
      "And if you’re lucky enough to live past the retirement age of 75 under Nikki Haley’s plan, and she wants to raise it… And remember this about now, she says, “I would never do that.” But politicians always go back to their first concept, to their first policy, to their first idea. They always do. And they’ll go back to it. They’ll go back to it as, sure as you’re standing here, and I’m sorry we got rid of the seats, but they couldn’t have enough room.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:08)\n",
      "And I heard we could have even done better, but the governor made it very difficult to get in. Does that make sense? Your governor. That’s what the word is.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:16)\n",
      "Now, I don’t imagine… I don’t imagine because we have these rooms all over the place that are loaded up with people, but I hear they made it a little bit difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:25)\n",
      "Nikki wants to gut… Oh, that’s right, he’s endorsing Nikki. He ran for president, you know that? He just didn’t have the courage… he didn’t have the courage to announce it. He ran and ran and ran and he was polling somewhere around Asa Hutchinson, or as I call him, Ada Hutchinson. Remember Ada? Ada Hutchinson. So he was polling right around there. Then he decided not to run if he looked at the poll numbers. But he never announced, didn’t have the courage to announce.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:53)\n",
      "He wants to gut Medicare using… The Paul Ryan, you talk about RINO, that’s a RINO. And it was a scheme that led to Democrat ads showing granny being wheeled off the cliff, just being wheeled off the cliff. You remember that ad? That was not a great ad for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:09)\n",
      "With your vote for our campaign on Tuesday… So important, most important vote you’re ever going to take or make, you can declare that the Republican Party is never going to go back to those days of weak establishment candidates who preach cutting Medicare and social security at home while they spend trillions and trillions of dollars on endless wars all over the place in countries that you’ve never even heard of and countries that don’t want us. It’s a terrible thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:38)\n",
      "We’re never going back to the days of globalist RINOs who promised border security before the election, but do the bidding of their open borders and donors after the election. And we’re never going back to any of the things that you see that are stupid things, very stupid things. They do very, very foolish things, costly and foolish\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump (20:00):\n",
      "\n",
      "And so bad for our country. So if you want a losing candidate who puts America last vote for Nikki Haley. But if you want a president who puts America first, every single time you’re going to vote for Donald J. Trump and you have to get out and vote. And as soon as I lift my hand from that beautiful Bible that we’re going to use, specific Bible, a very beautiful Bible as your 47th president and we’re all in this together. You’ve been great from day one. You were so great in 2016. You were so great to me. Remember we won by 21 points. We came in, they said, “Who the hell is that guy?” And we won by 21 points, but I’ll seal the border and we’ll shut down the invasion of our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "(20:43)\n",
      "Number one, that’s the first thing, and we will almost simultaneously, I would say let that have one day, right Al, one day. But we will unleash American energy like I unleashed it before except this time we’re going to keep it going because they turned it off. We will terminate every diversity, equity, and inclusion program across the entire federal government. And I will instruct the heads of ice and border patrol to begin the largest deportation program in American history.\n",
      "\n",
      "(21:13)\n",
      "We have no choice because this is not sustainable. Our cities are being choked. This is not sustainable. Three years ago we had the most secure border in the history of our country. We built 561 miles of border wall and got Mexico to give us 28,000 free of charge. You think that was easy? Not easy. Again, 28,000 soldiers, we had guarding our border and we had the best border numbers that we’ve ever had. We had the safest border in the history of our country, and all Biden had to do is go to the beach and relax. Okay? He was there anyway, but he’d go to the beach and say, “Let’s dismantle.” We had something called remain in Mexico. It all worked. It all worked, and it worked well. Under Biden, the USA has been turned into a dumping ground to the world, just a dumping ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:05)\n",
      "On day one, I will terminate every single open border policy that crooked Joe Biden and his administration have put onto our country. So sad. To stop the deadly drugs that are poisoning our people, I will deploy US Navy to impose a full fentanyl blockade on the waters and the region where they’re coming in through certain channels. They’re coming over land, they’re coming any way. They want to come, 12 times more than came in four years ago. 12 times more, drugs are pouring in. And by the way, you have two very bad distinctions. You’re the highest energy per capita. You’re the highest by far energy anywhere in the country, number one. And also you’re the worst in terms of drugs pouring in, and you have more drugs in New Hampshire per capita than any other state by far.\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:59)\n",
      "Where is your governor? Where is your governor? The drug cartels a waging war in America, and we will destroy the cartels. You have no choice. That’s an army. That’s an army. They’re trying to destroy our country and they will destroy our country, and I’ll use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries immediately. Nikki Haley will never secure the border or stop the fentanyl, I know her very well. She worked for me for a long time. People don’t realize I put her there because I wanted to make Henry McMaster… It’s true. You’re right. I wanted to make Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina. We did that and he has been one of the best governors in the country, Doug will tell you that. But killing thousands and thousands of people, Nikki opposed my border wall. She fought us on the border wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "(23:55)\n",
      "She got out and she fought us on the border wall. She condemned my strong border policies and in 2016, she stabbed the Republican Party in the back by siding with Barack Hussein Obama. Have you ever heard of him? Have you ever heard of the gentleman? Against the Trump travel ban, which really kept us safe. When I was there four years, I wanted to talk so much. We had no terrorism, we had no attacks, we had nothing. We had the Trump travel ban and we call it the terror ban. We wanted to stop terror from coming into our country, but I couldn’t talk about it because I didn’t want to do that. And then the following day, something happens. So I went four years keeping my mouth shut on that particular subject. But now I talk about it all the time. We had no attacks. We didn’t have a World Trade Center. We didn’t have the attacks like you’ve seen and certainly that you see in other countries.\n",

      "(24:46)\n",
      "And by the way, now we’re getting involved again in the Middle East. Look what’s happening. You’re getting involved. Here we go again with the Middle East. We spent $9 trillion, killed millions of people including our side, their side, millions of people, $9 trillion. You know what we got? Nothing. Nothing. You got death, you got blood, you got nothing. And we spent our blood and our treasure as they say, our blood and our treasure and our blood is more important than our treasure, then it’s a shame. It’s a shame. I beat ISIS, you’re right. Thank you for telling me that. You’re right. I was getting to that, but he’s very good. He’s sharp this one. Thank you. We did. We beat the hell out of ISIS. It was supposed to take four to five years, we got it done in four months I’d say, four months.\n",

      "100% of the ISIS caliphate, Biden and his thugs are desperate to stop us because we are the only ones and they know that who can stop them, and that’s why they’re weaponizing law enforcement and high level election interference, the likes of which this country has never seen. We’ve never seen anything like what’s happening with using the DOJ and the FBI to go after his political opponent. It’s unbelievable. The good news is it’s driven my poll numbers up. Someday we’re going to have to write a book about this one, but people understand and I have a voice, I have a big voice so I can speak about it. I can talk about it. I can talk about when they want to indict you and arrest you for election integrity, and they’re still fighting on the 2016 election, right? It’s okay for them. They’re fighting still. They’re fighting on the 2016.\n",

      "Same things, except much worse than they accuse our patriots. All we want is an honest election because if you don’t have honest elections and strong borders, you don’t have a country. Joe Biden is truly a threat to democracy for two reasons. Number one, we just said part of it, but number two is he’s incompetent, and that’s probably the biggest threat that we have is his incompetence. This is only happening because we’re leading big in the polls. If I didn’t run or if I wasn’t leading by so much in the polls, but if I didn’t run or if I was in number four place where they’re not too worried, none of this would be happening. None of this would be happening in the New Redfield… Thank you for saying that. That’s very nice. In the New Redfield Wilton poll, how about these numbers? How about these numbers in the New Redfield Wilton poll, it’s Trump 72, Haley nine. In Nevada… Thank you.\n",

      "In Nevada, where we’re going next? Actually, they think we’re going to South Carolina. We’re actually going to Nevada first, and we are polling there roughly 100% because all of the other candidates looked at the polls and they decided we’re not going to play in Nevada. So we get a hundred percent of that vote, but nobody wants to talk about that. Then we go to South Carolina, respected pollster, Tony Fabrizio, very respected. He has us at 64 to 25. That’s not bad. We’re running against the governor, having it pretty good. We’re leading in New Hampshire by a lot, but we take nothing… By a lot. You’re going to see it. I don’t have to talk about it too much. You’re going to see it tomorrow. The numbers, in my opinion, will be higher than what you’re even seeing. And you’re seeing very big numbers, but you got to go and vote.\n",

We have to get out. We have to vote. We have to show them in November what’s going on here, because I don’t think anybody understands. This is the single biggest political movement in history. It’s called Make America Great Again. Joe Biden doesn’t know. He says, “We have to stop MAGA,” but he doesn’t know it means Make America Great Again. How do you say, “We’re stopping MAGA? We got to stop it.” Make America Great Again, Joe. We’re going to stop America first. We’re also dominating crooked Joe Biden in the general election. We’re up eight points today, eight points in the very, very good Rasmussen poll. And remember, eight points is a lot because they have an automatic base of about 39.\n",

      "It’s sort of interesting. The Democrats have a base of 39 and Joe is polling at 32. So how the hell do you do that? How do you poll less? But they do. They have the advantage of because they have certain groups. I won’t go into the groups, but I think some of those groups like unions, they’re going to be with us. I believe a lot of them are going to be with us. So he’s polling at pretty low numbers actually. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election of 2020, and we are not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024 because if they do, we will not have a country left. And I was thinking about the other day… I don’t think I’ve said this before. I was thinking about this. If they didn’t illegally mess with me, you’ve been watching it all this time.

It was hunt. That’s another one. That’s another one. That’s another one. But think of it, I would now be rounding out my term. In other words, if they didn’t do all these things and I could name 10 more or more, I’d now be rounding it out. It would almost be over. But because they did mess with me, now they’ve got us and me for four more years. We’ll drive them crazy.

Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy independent or energy dominant as we were just a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. “Please, please, please,” says Joe Biden. Yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their rural production, while at the same time substantially increasing the price of oil. And we met that threat by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas of Alaska or elsewhere on our lands.\n",

And now we are a nation that wants to make a revered and very powerful army tanks, the best in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact that they are also not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way. And they also want to make our jet fighters with a green stamp of energy approval, though losing 15% efficiency, but allowing us to keep our enemies’ atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels never seen before.\n",

They gave them so much money, but those sanctions that I put on were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration.

We are a third world nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against the opposing political party like never before.

And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country, who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead, and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and China in possible nuclear war. And he has no idea what he’s doing. We could lead to World War III and far more devastating than any war. This will be a war like no other because the weaponry is so powerful, powerful beyond description, powerful beyond words. We are a nation that no longer has a free press.

And less than three years ago, we had Iran and China and Russia and North Korea and Czech. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They weren’t going to do a thing against us and everyone knows it. Now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the world.

They’re going to indict, they’re going to keep indicting, and it keeps driving my numbers up. I can’t figure that one out.\n",

      "But I believe she’s not electable. Nikki Haley wants to charge the working class a 23% national sales tax. Well, and you know that she wants to raise social security retirement age by approximately 10 years. Is that right? Approximately, so you can labor until the day you die and then not collect a penny of the benefits that you really have earned and you’ve paid for.\n",

      "And if you’re lucky enough to live past the retirement age of 75 under Nikki Haley’s plan, and she wants to raise it… And remember this about now, she says, “I would never do that.” But politicians always go back to their first concept, to their first policy, to their first idea. They always do. And they’ll go back to it. They’ll go back to it as, sure as you’re standing here, and I’m sorry we got rid of the seats, but they couldn’t have enough room.\n",

      "Nikki wants to gut… Oh, that’s right, he’s endorsing Nikki. He ran for president, you know that? He just didn’t have the courage… he didn’t have the courage to announce it. He ran and ran and ran and he was polling somewhere around Asa Hutchinson, or as I call him, Ada Hutchinson. Remember Ada? Ada Hutchinson. So he was polling right around there. Then he decided not to run if he looked at the poll numbers. But he never announced, didn’t have the courage to announce.\n",

And we’re never going back to any of the things that you see that are stupid things, very stupid things. They do very, very foolish things, costly and foolish \n",
      "And so bad for our country. So if you want a losing candidate who puts America last vote for Nikki Haley. But if you want a president who puts America first, every single time you’re going to vote for Donald J. Trump and you have to get out and vote. And as soon as I lift my hand from that beautiful Bible that we’re going to use, specific Bible, a very beautiful Bible as your 47th president and we’re all in this together. You’ve been great from day one. You were so great in 2016. You were so great to me. Remember we won by 21 points.

But we will unleash American energy like I unleashed it before except this time we’re going to keep it going because they turned it off. We will terminate every diversity, equity, and inclusion program across the entire federal government.

Again, 28,000 soldiers, we had guarding our border and we had the best border numbers that we’ve ever had. We had the safest border in the history of our country, and all Biden had to do is go to the beach and relax. Okay? He was there anyway, but he’d go to the beach and say, “Let’s dismantle.” We had something called remain in Mexico. It all worked. It all worked, and it worked well. Under Biden, the USA has been turned into a dumping ground to the world, just a dumping ground.\n",

To stop the deadly drugs that are poisoning our people, I will deploy US Navy to impose a full fentanyl blockade on the waters and the region where they’re coming in through certain channels. They’re coming over land, they’re coming any way. They want to come, 12 times more than came in four years ago. 12 times more, drugs are pouring in. And by the way, you have two very bad distinctions. You’re the highest energy per capita. You’re the highest by far energy anywhere in the country, number one. And also you’re the worst in terms of drugs pouring in, and you have more drugs in New Hampshire per capita than any other state by far.\n",

They’re trying to destroy our country and they will destroy our country, and I’ll use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries immediately. Nikki Haley will never secure the border or stop the fentanyl, I know her very well. She worked for me for a long time. People don’t realize I put her there because I wanted to make Henry McMaster… It’s true. You’re right. I wanted to make Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina. We did that and he has been one of the best governors in the country, Doug will tell you that. But killing thousands and thousands of people, Nikki opposed my border wall. She fought us on the border wall.\n",

Have you ever heard of him? Have you ever heard of the gentleman? Against the Trump travel ban, which really kept us safe. When I was there four years, I wanted to talk so much. We had no terrorism, we had no attacks, we had nothing. We had the Trump travel ban and we call it the terror ban. We wanted to stop terror from coming into our country, but I couldn’t talk about it because I didn’t want to do that. And then the following day, something happens. So I went four years keeping my mouth shut on that particular subject. But now I talk about it all the time. We had no attacks. We didn’t have a World Trade Center.

This is only happening because we’re leading big in the polls. If I didn’t run or if I wasn’t leading by so much in the polls, but if I didn’t run or if I was in number four place where they’re not too worried, none of this would be happening. None of this would be happening in the New Redfield… Thank you for saying that. That’s very nice. In the New Redfield Wilton poll, how about these numbers?

It’s called Make America Great Again. Joe Biden doesn’t know. He says, “We have to stop MAGA,” but he doesn’t know it means Make America Great Again. How do you say, “We’re stopping MAGA? We got to stop it.” Make America Great Again, Joe. We’re going to stop America first. We’re also dominating crooked Joe Biden in the general election.

But he wanted this and I’ll give him full credit for it. It’s very important actually.

If you took the worst 10 presidents in the history of our country, think of it, the worst 10, and you added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to the United States that we love so much as Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done. Look at what they’ve done. Look at the Afghanistan embarrassment, the worst ever in the history, the most embarrassing moment, I believe, in the history of our country. Look at the border.

They say they’re the toughest gangs in the world. I think they’re probably not compared to some of the gangs that are coming in now from parts unknown, right? But we took out thousands and thousands. They’re now being let out of jails and they’re coming into our country. Many of them have already come in.

And now we are a nation that wants to make a revered and very powerful army tanks, the best in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact that they are also not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way.

They gave them so much money, but those sanctions that I put on were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration.

And he has no idea what he’s doing. We could lead to World War III and far more devastating than any war.

And less than three years ago, we had Iran and China and Russia and North Korea and Czech. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They weren’t going to do a thing against us and everyone knows it. Now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the world.

And I think we had a very productive meeting. Stranger things have happened. Usually a Republican wouldn’t get that endorsement for many, many years. They only do Democrats.

You would not have the inflation that is destroying our country. The inflation is so bad. The damage done already by inflation has been so bad. And while it may be down, you’re still up 30%.

You don’t need a deal to tighten up the border and to make it secure. I had the most secure border in history. I didn’t have a deal. I didn’t have a bill. I said, “No people are coming in. No drugs are coming in. We don’t want to have human trafficking,” which nobody even talks about. That is the number one… You take a look at that border today, human trafficking is up 114% they say. 114%. You wouldn’t have that.\n",

      "We were working so hard on human trafficking. It’s a horrible thing. You think of it as an ancient crime. It’s not ancient. Because of the internet it’s, for the people that do it, a tremendous money maker. None of that, you would’ve had none of that. And now you look at what’s happening, the numbers are astronomical.\n",

      "(04:47)\n",
      "And drugs too. The drugs boring into our border. And you have the right to close up your border. You don’t need bills that complicate it and make it to a level that nobody’s going to be able to do it. And the minimum was 5,000 people a day, if that can be right. It’s hard to believe that that can be right. But they were negotiating to allow 5,000 people a day. That’s a tremendous amount. Nobody wants to have that happen to our country, and they’re still not going to know where they’re coming from. Right now, we have no idea who these people are that are pouring into our countries.\n",

And very importantly, I can tell you, they come from jails and prisons, they come from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they’re terrorists. They have a lot of terrorists coming too.

If it’s not going to be good, if it’s not going to solve the border problem, don’t do the bill. And that was very important to me. And a lot of people do call me and they respect me and they say, “What do you think?” If the bill’s not going to be a great bill and really solve the problem, I wouldn’t do it at all.

      "Well, thank you very much. We had a very strong meeting with the Teamsters. Over the years I’ve employed thousands and thousands of Teamsters and they’ve done a great job, especially in New York where we have a lot of unions.\n",

      "I’ve had great relationships with the Union. We’re with Sean O’Brien, as you know, and Fred Zuckerman and the terrific people, great leaders actually. And I think we had a very productive meeting. Stranger things have happened. Usually a Republican wouldn’t get that endorsement for many, many years. They only do Democrats. But in my case, it’s different because I’ve employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\n",

Some people say more than 50%, nobody knows what the exact number is, but some people say more than 50% of the Teamsters vote for me. We had a very, very productive meeting, I think with a lot of Teamster representatives upstairs. \n",
      "I don’t know that they’re going to meet with her. I mean, she’s down at 12%. I think a poll came out today. It’s 88 to 12, so I don’t know. If they want to waste their time. They can do that. That’s up to them. \n",
      "It wouldn’t have happened if I were in the White House. You would’ve never had this attack. You would’ve never had the attack on Israel. You would’ve never had the attack on Ukraine. You would not have the inflation that is destroying our country. The inflation is so bad. The damage done already by inflation has been so bad. And while it may be down, you’re still up 30%. Prices are 30% higher than they were four years ago, and that’s a bad thing.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "You wouldn’t have had any of that. But you wouldn’t have had attacks on Israel. You wouldn’t have had attacks, period. They weren’t attacking. I knocked out ISIS. We took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. That was it. We pulled our troops out. Nobody’s done what I did. And you would’ve had no attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Putin would not have attacked, guaranteed. For two reasons. The oil went up so high under Biden that they made money by attacking. But for two reasons. The other reason is he wouldn’t have done it against me. He would not have done it. We used to talk about Ukraine. It was the apple of his eye. He would’ve never done it.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And Israel would’ve never been attacked, would’ve never been attacked. And China wouldn’t be talking about Taiwan. All of these things that it’s so sad to see. And now here we go with the Middle East again, dropping bombs all over the place, it would’ve never happened. \n",
      "Well, I want to bring jobs back to the country and I want to bring jobs back to the United States. We were doing that and at the Trump administration at a level like nobody had ever seen, we saved the steel industry. Now US Steel is being bought by Japan. It’s so terrible. But yeah, we want to bring jobs back to the country and sometimes tariffs can do that. But we will bring back millions of jobs to our country and we’re going to start making our product.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And we started that process and did very well with it, and we will finish it up. But right now, a lot of the progress that we made, whether it’s on the border, because we had the safest border ever, and now we have the worst border ever. And I mean anywhere, there’s never been a border like this ever in the world what’s happening at our border.\n",
      "\n",

You don’t need a deal to tighten up the border and to make it secure. I had the most secure border in history. I didn’t have a deal. I didn’t have a bill. I said, “No people are coming in. No drugs are coming in. We don’t want to have human trafficking,” which nobody even talks about. That is the number one… You take a look at that border today, human trafficking is up 114% they say. 114%. You wouldn’t have that.\n",

It’s hard to believe that that can be right. But they were negotiating to allow 5,000 people a day. That’s a tremendous amount.

As you know, I watched her speech last night, I thought it was inappropriate, but because it’s bad for unity, it’s bad for the party, what she said. You’d almost think she won.

Never Trumpers here, they’re a dying breed, I will say. Like a guy like RINO Paul Ryan, he was so bad for us; liberal Larry Hogan, that’s another beauty; open borders RINO Charles Koch.

So this is what we have. And now he’s our president and now he’s our president at a reduced level, okay? At a reduced level. We’re dealing with the most complex and most powerful weapons in the world. And we have a man that has no idea what he’s doing. And you’ll end up in World War III. I’m the only one that can promise you that we will not end up in World War III. There’s not going to be World Wars. Not with me. There’s not going to be World Wars. And we do that through strength, not through…\n",

      "So what I want to do is I want to just tell you it’s very simple. We have to get out. We have to take back our country. We have a country that’s in such bad shape. We have to take it back. Nikki Haley is a disaster. She worked for me for a long time. I mean, I know it very well. I actually put her there for a different reason. I shouldn’t say this, but you had a lieutenant governor named Henry McMaster who was fantastic. I figured if I took her out of South Carolina governorship, put her someplace, any place. I put her someplace. Then Henry McMaster, who was my friend and who’s turned out to be a great governor in South Carolina, Henry McMaster would become the governor. So I moved her to the United Nations. And honestly, she was not a good negotiator. She was not a good negotiator. Now she likes to talk about when I negotiated with China… I negotiated with China. I did all of it. We got in hundreds of billions of dollars and I did it. And she has a hit on social security. She wants to raise the age very substantially. You don’t need that. We don’t want to do that. And we have that liquid gold. We don’t have to do that to our seniors. You earned it. You’re right. Who said that? That’s a good point. You earned it. You did earn it, and you don’t need that. And the same thing with Medicare. They want to obliterate it. We’re not going to do that. So I say this, get out and vote and make sure we win by big margins. The bigger the margin, the bigger the mandate that we have, the stronger we’re going to be. And I mean strong, not just for the next state, because the next state is Nevada and we’re leading by 90 points.\n",

But I’m talking about November. We have to win. Let’s send the word to the other side. They’re very destructive. Remember this, and I say it all the time. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of our country, they will not have done the damage that crooked Joe Biden and this corrupt administration have done to the United States of America. So we want to send a strong signal. So even though we’re leading by a lot, you have to go out and vote. You just have to do it. If it’s cold, if it’s hot, I don’t care what the hell it is, you have to go out and vote, okay? And just don’t sit back.\n",

I love the president, but he’s going to win by so much.” Because we have to show big margins. We have to show margins like never before, which is what happened last night. We have to show margins like never before because we have to take back our country. And if we don’t take back our country, we’re not going to have a country. I love your state.

If they let the Trump’s tax cuts, the biggest in history, if they let that float and go back, your taxes are going to quadruple. It’s going to quadruple. We can’t let it happen.

I know the weak ones, the stupid ones, the brilliant ones. I know them all. I know the best ones. I went there. I said, “How’s this guy, had to rely on rhinos to give me advice. I don’t like that kind of advice.” And we had great people. Look, we rebuilt our military. Think of all the things we did even right to try, you know medical.

I said, these people are terminally ill. They’re not going to get injured. They’re dying. They’re going to be dead in a fairly short period of time. They will sign something.

You had no inflation, you had nothing. Israel would’ve never been attacked, Ukraine would’ve never been attacked. I know Putin very well, there was no way he was going to do it. One of the reasons he did it is he, Biden, drove oil prices up so high, makes his money with oil. He was making a fortune, he had plenty of money to prosecute it.

      "Waterloo, thank you very much. It’s great to be here. And a lot of people outside, a lot of people outside. We want to stay right here and I want to thank you very much. This is an honor. We cover all corners of your great state, you know that. And they said, “Waterloo. What about Waterloo?” I said, “We got to get to Waterloo.” So here we are. And I’m thrilled to be back in your incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Let me begin by wishing you all a very merry Christmas. Do you remember about seven years ago, I came, I said, “They’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again” because department stores, of course, they have other problems now. They’re being robbed. The department stores right now, they have very big problems. 400-500 people run into them, grab everything, run out, nothing happens because our law enforcement’s not allowed to do their job. They’re great. They’re not allowed to do their job, so they have other problems too, but they say Merry Christmas now at least. And it’s very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:08)\n",
      "That was a big deal and now nobody even thinks about it. We say Merry Christmas. I’m honored by that. We’re just 27 days away from Iowa’s first-in-the-nation. Thank you very much President Trump because you’re first-in-the-nation because I said you were first-in-the-nation. It’s very simple. And the caucuses are a big deal. On Monday, January 15th, we’re going to win the Iowa caucuses and then we’re going to crush crooked Joe Biden next November, and we’re going to, very simply, make America great again. Thank you. Thank you guys.I want to thank a very special person. She stepped up very early and very strong and she’s a highly respected. We have to call everyone a politician, I guess, if you run for office. I think she’s probably your most popular politician right now in Iowa. Brenna Bird, your Attorney General. Thank you, Brenna. Thank you, darling. She’s been incredible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:09)\n",
      "A man who endorsed me before I was even running. I said, “Who’s this guy from Iowa that keeps talking about Trump?” I call him the Marlboro man. He’s a handsome guy. State Senator Brad Zaun. Brad, Brad, where’s Brad? Thank you, Brad. Thank you very much. He’s been great. I mean, he was endorsing me before I ran. I said, “Who is that guy?” But he was probably the first one in the whole country. State representatives, Bobby Kaufmann, who’s fantastic by the way. His father’s fantastic too. Derek Wolfe, Craig Johnson, and of course Iowa GOP Chairman, Jeff Kaufmann. There’s a slight relationship there. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody and a great job, and it’s fantastic to be with you. We’ll be back a few more times, believe it or not. We have that big day coming up. We’ll be back.\n",

      "(03:08)\n",
      "We got to be sure that we put this thing away. The poll numbers are scary because we’re leading by so much. The key is you have to get out and vote because I tell it all the time, if you don’t get out and vote, we can put this to bed after Iowa, if you want to know the truth. We can put it to bed for them too, they can go home and forget it. But you have to go out. Don’t sit home and say, “I think we’ll take it easy, darling. It’s a wonderful day. Beautiful. Let’s just take it easy, watch television and watch the results.” No because crazy things can happen. You got to get out. This is really important. Our country’s at stake. We have a country that’s never been in trouble like it is right now. So get out and vote whether we’re leading in the polls or not leading in the polls, and in this case we’re leading by 30-40 points, I guess, but we got to win. Maybe we can win by more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:01)\n",
      "Because if we win in a massive number, but it’s a little bit less than that, they’ll say, “Oh, he didn’t meet expectations,” because they’re fake news. We know that. They’re fake news. They are the biggest fakers in the world. During this holiday season, families all across America are struggling under the brutal weight of crooked Joe’s failures, disasters, heartless betrayals and inflation. While the stock market is making rich people richer and I mean, it’s crazy what’s going on. Rich people are getting richer. Of course, I’m a politician now, so we just keep chugging along, but you’re going to have a crash, the likes of which you haven’t seen because of what they’re doing. It’s going to be scary. Biden’s inflation catastrophe is demolishing your savings and ravaging your dreams. His sky high energy prices, the highest we’ve ever had, are brutalizing your wallets. Our border has been erased. Criminals are running wild and our Democrat run cities and thanks to crooked Joe’s breathtaking weakness, the world is going up in flames. The whole world is up in flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:12)\n",
      "You didn’t have any of this stuff when I was president. I’d call and I’d say, “You can’t do that,” to the head of a country, and they wouldn’t do it, and Russia would’ve never done it, and Hamas would never have done it because Iran wouldn’t have given him the money or had the money to do it. No, it’s very terrible what’s going on. Hard to believe actually. Joe Biden and the Democrat Party are incapable of solving any problems. Crooked Joe Biden is a low IQ individual. He is truly the worst, most incompetent and most corrupt president in the history of our country. Other than that, I think quite a bit of him. Can you believe what’s going on in our country? Can you believe what’s going on with the border? And the fake news doesn’t want to show it too much, certain of them, and I will tell you what’s going on in our border. They’re coming in by the millions and we have no idea who they are, coming from all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:13)\n",
      "But with your vote this election together, we’re going to save America and we’re going to bring our country back from hell. Our country has been in hell. Not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden. Under the Trump administration, you were better off. Your family was better off, your neighbors were better off, and our country was better off. And you’re also much safer when you had me behind the desk of the Oval Office. You were better off five years ago. Think of it. Just ask yourself, were you better off five years ago or are you better off today with the inflation with bacon that cost you four times higher than you would’ve had to pay a little while ago? It’s going up. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, but what a difference a president makes. A president makes a big difference. Since Joe Biden took over, we’ve had a three year inflation rate of over 20%. Under my leadership, inflation was non-existent, and we had gasoline at $1.87 a gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:15)\n",
      "After three years of Bidenomics, the average monthly mortgage has gone from $1,700 under my administration to $3,400 under this terrible administration. As long as Joe Biden is in the White House, the American dream is dead. It’s dead. There is no American dream. But all of that will change the minute the polls close on election night 2024. It’s going to all change. The next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked Joe Biden is gone, and Donald J. Trump and us, all of us together, have won four more years as President of the United States. It’s a very important thing because our country, it’s a disaster. It’s not even believable what’s happened to our country in a period of three years. Powered by the momentum of our historic victory, by Christmas of next year, it’s a couple of months later, by Christmas of next year, the economy will be roaring back, energy prices will be plummeting, the hoards of people charging across our border will have totally ended, the invasion will have stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:28)\n",
      "And I heard somebody today say, one of these genius analysts, “The stock market’s good, the rich get richer, but the stock market’s good because they think Trump is going to win the election.” And I believe that’s true, and whatever good they have right now is the fumes of what we left them. It’s coming off the fumes of what we’ve left them. But the stock market is good because a lot of people think we’re going to win the election, so that’s an interesting fact. I felt that, but I didn’t want to say it, but I think we will say it because just like three years ago, they will know that I will catch. And when you have people that are pouring across the border at levels like no country has ever seen, not us, no country has ever seen, third world nations have never seen. They’d stop them with sticks and stones, I say.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:25)\n",
      "But they’ll know that I’ll catch them and will send them home and the entire world will be safer and more peaceful because everyone will know that the days of Biden surrenders are over. So many mistakes. There’s been nothing good that’s happened, nothing good. What good has happened in the last three years? Our country’s gone to hell. As soon as I get back in the Oval Office, I’ll also immediately end the war on Christians. I don’t know if you feel it. You have a war. There’s a war. Under crooked Joe Biden, Christians and Americans of faith are being persecuted and government has been weaponized against religion like never before. And also presidents like never before. Here I am. I always say Al Capone was treated better than I was treated. Scarface, Al Capone, he was a tough one. Biden and his corrupt department of injustice have sent SWAT teams to arrest pro-life activists. They’ve targeted conservative parents of school board meetings who don’t want filth taught to their children. It’s filth. What they’re teaching in schools is filth and nonsense, and we can’t let that happen, but they’re being targeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:37)\n",
      "And now the communist Marxists and fascists are going hard after Catholics. Even plotting to send spies into Catholic churches. It’s all come out just like in the Soviet Union from days gone by. Now, think of it, if you’re Catholic, why would you vote for a Democrat? What they’re doing to Catholics, I don’t know what’s going on with the Catholics, but they’re really being persecuted. Why would you vote for Biden and why would you vote for a Democrat? A new report from the House Judiciary Committee proves that the Biden FBI actually targeted Catholics as potential domestic terrorists. You believe this? And evangelicals will not be far behind because when that starts, it starts happening on a very major scale. When I’m back in the White House, never again will your government be used to target Christians and other religious believers. Upon taking office, I will create a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias to be led by a fully reformed department of justice that’s fair and equitable. Its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America. They are going after Christians in America. Who can believe all this stuff? It’s not believable, is it? But it is fact. It’s just like so many of the other things. When I stand up and I say that we will stop and I’ve said it, we will stop men from participating in women’s sports. I mean the whole thing. No, but things that you say that you can’t believe, you’re up here and saying it. We are for parental rights. You have to say that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:29)\n",
      "No, no, think of it. We are for parental rights. Who believes it? 10 years ago, 15 years ago, who would ever have to say a thing like that? We’re for parental rights. Of course we’re for parental rights, but the Democrats aren’t. They’re fascists. They’re not. They want school boards. They want people to take your children and do things with your children that are not even speakable. Americans of faith are not a threat to our country. Americans of faith are the soul of our country, and they have been from the beginning. I will defend religion and I will defend in God we trust. We will defend, in God we trust, which is… And you know that very important phrase is under siege. You do know that, right? We will defend it 100%. When Joe Biden lit the national Christmas tree earlier this month, he completely failed to even mention the birth of Jesus Christ, which is hard to do if you’re celebrating Christmas, right? He didn’t mention Jesus Christ in his remarks. Not for three years. He hasn’t mentioned that and barely mentioned God.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:35)\n",
      "When I was president, we brought back the beautiful phrase, “Merry Christmas,” and I said I’d do that. I’m very proud of that actually, because as I said at the beginning, it was really under siege, and when I lit the Christmas tree each year, it was my honor to publicly celebrate the true source of Christmas joy, which is Jesus Christ. As president, I kept every promise I made to Christians and more, and I think everybody in this room understands that very well. That’s pretty well documented. In our first four years, we appointed nearly 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. I stood up for religious liberty at home and all around the world. I protected innocent life and I defended the Judeo-Christian values of our nation’s founding. I proudly recognized Israel’s eternal capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem, which is a big thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:34)\n",
      "I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and they were looking to get that for 72 years. They’d fly in, they’d fly out, they’d fly in. Every year, they’d fly in, they’d discuss it, they’d fly out, and I got it done in about 12 minutes. We got it done very quickly. And with the historic Abraham Accords, I even made peace in the Middle East. Unfortunately, they haven’t taken it any further. It should have been taken. We could have had everybody signed up. It’s no wonder crooked Joe Biden and the far left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary. They’re willing to violate the US constitutions at levels never seen before in order to win this election. Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. It’s a threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:22)\n",
      "They’re weaponizing law enforcement for high level election interference because we’re beating them so badly in the polls. The new CBS poll, remember I always used to talk about polls, but only if they were good. I don’t mention them if they were bad. I had a tendency if they were bad, I didn’t talk about them. I don’t know. That’s probably a little bit like the fake news would do, so I feel very embarrassed by it. But the new CBS poll just out has us at 58% of the state with the sanctimonious 40 points behind us, 40 points. The new Morning Consult\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Trump (16:00):\n",
      "\n",
      "… Paul, that’s in your state. The console, Paul has us at 66% nationwide with the DeSanctis at 11% and Haley at 11%. And then they said, “Haley is surging,” because she went from 9 to 11. I went up seven points. She went up two points, and it’s harder to go up seven when you’re almost at the top. There’s not that many points left. I went up seven, she went up two and the headline was, “Haley is surging because she caught De-Sanctimonious.” The Fox poll has us trouncing the primary field at 69% with the De-Sanctus at 13% and Haley at 9. It’s interesting, he did an interview the other day and the announcer, this was a straight interview at a major network, “Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great honor to have Governor Ron DeSanctis with us. No, no, it’s DeSantis.” So that’s good branding, do you agree? That’s good. Nah, but he is sanctimonious.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:58)\n",
      "In the new Rasmussen poll of the general election, we’re dominating by 10, 11, 12, even 14 points. And the Washington Post had up 11 and then they said, “Oh, this must be an outlier.” They spend a million and a half dollars on a poll, the Washington Post, and they panic. They say, “This must be an outlier.” This is the first time anyone ever had a poll and they said, “We think our poll must be wrong.” But we have even better numbers than that. Now they’re going crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:27)\n",
      "But none of this matters if you don’t show up to support us on January 15th and again on November 5th. So, it’s again, the same thing, you got to show up. Even if you think we’re going to win by a lot, you got to show up, because winning by a lot lot is very meaningful. Even as countries watch from afar, because we would never have any of these problems if our were president… But when they see the kind of support that we have, we have incredible support. We have more support than we did in 2020 or 2016, and we did great. We won 2016, and then we did even better by a lot, by millions and millions of votes in 2020, it was a rigged election. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election of 2020 and we’re not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. We’re not going to allow them.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:20)\n",
      "Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxist, communist, and fascists indict me, I consider it actually a great badge of honor. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you very much, because I’m being indicted for you. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. It’s very simple. I’m not going to let them do it. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you, and in the end, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I just happen to be standing in their way and I always will stand in their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:57)\n",
      "I’ve been saying this a lot lately because I see the kind of crowds, we go up to these large areas, we come out to the rural areas, no matter where we go, we have packed houses, packed houses, some of them. We filled up an arena last time, a massive arena. We had thousands of people outside, couldn’t get in. Brad was there, couldn’t get in. He got in. We almost said, “Keep him out. Let’s keep him out,” right? No, he’s always going to be invited. This is far more than a campaign. This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country. That’s what it is, this is a great political movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:39)\n",
      "This is not just a campaign, and together we will once again fight for Iowa families and Iowa farmers, just as we did four straight years. We fought for you. We’ve done more for the state of Iowa than any president ever in history. Because when you add it all up, what we’ve done, unlike crooked Joe who wants to dramatically increase the estate tax or the death taxes, they call it, I virtually eliminated the unfair death tax, saving countless farms from families and families of farmers. They love their children, they leave their farm to the children, and the tax was so incredible that the children would often have to file bankruptcy because they had to go borrow money to pay the estate tax or the death tax. I eliminated that tax, I eliminated it. So, now you can leave, if you love your children… If you don’t love your children, then I haven’t done that much for you. But some people love their children. Does everybody in this room love their children? I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "(20:41)\n",
      "Does anybody in this room not love their children? Raise your hand. Oh, that guy in the blue jacket raised his… But no, it’s very important, because people were going to the heirs. You inherit a farm, you have a 40, 50% tax to pay and they fight with you over the tax and they end up going to the bankers. The banks just have been so bad. Not the local bank. Some of these big banks have been horrible, the horrible people running them. But the banks, they loan the money, and they end up taking over the farm. We’re not doing that. So, we ended the estate tax and farms and small businesses, now they don’t have to go into hock and end up losing everything, and the parents are very happy about that. They’re looking down and they’re saying, “I’m so happy. I love President Trump, because that was a big thing.”\n",

      "I ended the NAFTA disaster, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with the USMCA, the best trade deal ever made. That was a giant win for Iowa farmers. I took on the communist Chinese like no administration in history. Communist China was doing a number on the farmers, and you know it better than anybody, bringing hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our treasury when no other president had gotten 10 cents from China. Nobody had ever brought in any money. I brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. In fact, China’s not now doing very well, and a lot of people think it was because of what I did with respect to all of the hundreds of billions I brought in. Biden is unable to cancel it, because it’s so much money, that they’re having a hard time canceling it. So I just say, “Oh gee, let’s not do that for hundreds of billions of dollars.” Then I gave the farmers $28 billion straight out of the tariffs I took in from China, a large part of which came right back to the state of Iowa, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:40)\n",
      "That’s why my people in the back, my great geniuses, “Sir, please don’t say that too often, because you sound very conceited when you say that you guarantee that Iowa is going to vote for you. You guarantee Iowa.” I said, “I got them $28 billion, of course, who else is going to get them $28 billion?” I said, ” Go out and buy more land and larger tractors,” do you remember that? But you know what? They stuck with me, because we had a period of six or seven months, which [inaudible 00:23:10] the great negotiators, they were playing hardball, but we ended up winning and they buy now… We made a trade deal with John. I don’t even talk about it because of Covid, but we made one of the greatest trade deals ever made. They buy $50 billion worth of product from this country, and they were buying nothing before that. They were buying nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(23:27)\n",
      "So, it was an amazing thing that happened, and it’s an honor to have done it, and I do believe, I could say that, but I won’t say it, I will not say that, because my people have said. So, I will not guarantee it, but I pretty much guarantee it, okay? “Let’s vote against Trump because he gave us $28 billion.” I don’t know. Somehow they got a problem with that one, don’t they, huh, the people that are running against us and who, frankly, were not in favor of farmers. Ron De-Sanctimonious was not a friend of the farmer. He fought against the Farm Bill, he fought against ethanol, hard, very hard. Now all of a sudden, he loves ethanol. About two weeks ago it started, right? No one gets abused on trade worse than American agriculture, yet no other president lifted a finger for you. Nobody lifted a finger for you in Iowa, nobody. Under my leadership, we will have a great rebirth of loyalty to the American farmer and loyalty to the American flag. I’m going to pass something that’s so important. We were just about set to do that. We had the greatest economy in history. We’re just about set, and then we hit Covid. Covid came, a gift from China, from Wuhan. I told them it came from the Wuhan lab. I said it right from the beginning. I never changed. You ever see the heads, “Trump was right about everything.” Some of the things I don’t want to be right about, like I think our country’s in more danger now for World War III than ever before. I don’t want to be right about that, but we have a man who’s grossly incompetent and he’s talking about nuclear weapons and negotiations. He doesn’t even know what the hell he’s talking… He can’t even find the stairs to get off a stage, right? There they are. There they are. They’re all over the place. Jump off the front, but don’t walk into the back wall. You ever see that? He finishes a speech, if you call it that.\n",

Oh.” The guy says, “Mr. President, what about this? What about that? What about that?” “I would like to tell you the following.” He’s reading the answer, meaning he knows the questions and they write down the answer. He reads the answer. If I ever did that, they would impeach me a third time, right? They would impeach me a third… We beat them twice. They impeached me and then they found out I was right. They’re all saying, “We really shouldn’t have impeached him,” but actually the Republicans, and Jim Jordan’s great and Jamie is doing a great job, but the Republicans are being much nicer, because they’re saying, “Let’s do an inquiry first.” They didn’t do an inquiry with me.

We’ll take in billions and billions. Now, what will happen, is they’ll end the tax. They’ll end the tax, but we’re all set to get that. We would’ve had that quickly. I will revoke China’s most-favored-nation trade status that we will impose stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers, because they abuse us, but many people abuse us on trade and even the military.

Gas prices, oil prices down so low, record numbers in some cases, but down so low, and we were going to sell it all over the world, fill up our strategic reserve, which I was doing very cheaply by comparison to what they’re doing now. He used the money just to have a better election. He used a lot of the money. It’s strange, it’s the lowest point it’s ever been right now. That’s meant for military. That’s meant for real problems, not to keep your gasoline price down so that you can get some votes during an election, but they brought it down to the lowest level in order to try and remain relevant for an election. It’s very terrible what they’ve done. They’ve done a lot of bad things.\n",

It was eight months and I did it all year round. Nobody thought that was going to happen, and letting them use the existing pumps. Now, that doesn’t sound very glamorous, but it was hundreds of millions of dollars would’ve had to be spent. That would’ve been an increase in price to you, and I let them use the existing pumps. Very simple, I brought in experts. I said, “Well, what’s the difference?” They said, “Well, sir, the old ones are actually better.” I know that, because a lot of times the older equipment is a lot better than the new equipment, and… Like grass cutters, all you have in a grass cutter today is environmental computers and equipment. They forgot to put blades on it to cut the grass. Sometimes you’d rather have like a blade, give me a blade to cut the grass.\n",

Worked the fields, built the factories and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to make this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower and its strength. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue.

We cover all corners of your great state, you know that. And they said, “Waterloo. What about Waterloo?” I said, “We got to get to Waterloo.” So here we are. And I’m thrilled to be back in your incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Let me begin by wishing you all a very merry Christmas. Do you remember about seven years ago, I came, I said, “They’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again” because department stores, of course, they have other problems now. They’re being robbed. The department stores right now, they have very big problems. 400-500 people run into them, grab everything, run out, nothing happens because our law enforcement’s not allowed to do their job. They’re great. They’re not allowed to do their job, so they have other problems too, but they say Merry Christmas now at least. And it’s very important.\n",

We can put it to bed for them too, they can go home and forget it. But you have to go out. Don’t sit home and say, “I think we’ll take it easy, darling. It’s a wonderful day. Beautiful. Let’s just take it easy, watch television and watch the results.” No because crazy things can happen. You got to get out. This is really important. Our country’s at stake. We have a country that’s never been in trouble like it is right now.

During this holiday season, families all across America are struggling under the brutal weight of crooked Joe’s failures, disasters, heartless betrayals and inflation. While the stock market is making rich people richer and I mean, it’s crazy what’s going on. Rich people are getting richer. Of course, I’m a politician now, so we just keep chugging along, but you’re going to have a crash, the likes of which you haven’t seen because of what they’re doing. It’s going to be scary. Biden’s inflation catastrophe is demolishing your savings and ravaging your dreams. His sky high energy prices, the highest we’ve ever had, are brutalizing your wallets. Our border has been erased.

No, it’s very terrible what’s going on. Hard to believe actually. Joe Biden and the Democrat Party are incapable of solving any problems. Crooked Joe Biden is a low IQ individual. He is truly the worst, most incompetent and most corrupt president in the history of our country. Other than that, I think quite a bit of him. Can you believe what’s going on in our country? Can you believe what’s going on with the border? And the fake news doesn’t want to show it too much, certain of them, and I will tell you what’s going on in our border.

Not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden. Under the Trump administration, you were better off. Your family was better off, your neighbors were better off, and our country was better off. And you’re also much safer when you had me behind the desk of the Oval Office. You were better off five years ago. Think of it. Just ask yourself, were you better off five years ago or are you better off today with the inflation with bacon that cost you four times higher than you would’ve had to pay a little while ago? It’s going up. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it, but what a difference a president makes. A president makes a big difference. Since Joe Biden took over, we’ve had a three year inflation rate of over 20%. Under my leadership, inflation was non-existent, and we had gasoline at $1.87 a gallon.\n",

As long as Joe Biden is in the White House, the American dream is dead. It’s dead. There is no American dream. But all of that will change the minute the polls close on election night 2024. It’s going to all change. The next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked Joe Biden is gone, and Donald J. Trump and us, all of us together, have won four more years as President of the United States. It’s a very important thing because our country, it’s a disaster. It’s not even believable what’s happened to our country in a period of three years. Powered by the momentum of our historic victory, by Christmas of next year, it’s a couple of months later, by Christmas of next year, the economy will be roaring back, energy prices will be plummeting, the hoards of people charging across our border will have totally ended, the invasion will have stopped.\n",

It’s coming off the fumes of what we’ve left them. But the stock market is good because a lot of people think we’re going to win the election, so that’s an interesting fact. I felt that, but I didn’t want to say it, but I think we will say it because just like three years ago, they will know that I will catch. And when you have people that are pouring across the border at levels like no country has ever seen, not us, no country has ever seen, third world nations have never seen. They’d stop them with sticks and stones, I say.\n",

So many mistakes. There’s been nothing good that’s happened, nothing good. What good has happened in the last three years? Our country’s gone to hell. As soon as I get back in the Oval Office, I’ll also immediately end the war on Christians. I don’t know if you feel it. You have a war. There’s a war. Under crooked Joe Biden, Christians and Americans of faith are being persecuted and government has been weaponized against religion like never before. And also presidents like never before. Here I am. I always say Al Capone was treated better than I was treated. Scarface, Al Capone, he was a tough one. Biden and his corrupt department of injustice have sent SWAT teams to arrest pro-life activists. They’ve targeted conservative parents of school board meetings who don’t want filth taught to their children. It’s filth. What they’re teaching in schools is filth and nonsense, and we can’t let that happen, but they’re being targeted.\n",

What they’re doing to Catholics, I don’t know what’s going on with the Catholics, but they’re really being persecuted. Why would you vote for Biden and why would you vote for a Democrat? A new report from the House Judiciary Committee proves that the Biden FBI actually targeted Catholics as potential domestic terrorists. You believe this? And evangelicals will not be far behind because when that starts, it starts happening on a very major scale. When I’m back in the White House, never again will your government be used to target Christians and other religious believers. Upon taking office, I will create a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias to be led by a fully reformed department of justice that’s fair and equitable. Its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America. They are going after Christians in America. Who can believe all this stuff? It’s not believable, is it? But it is fact. It’s just like so many of the other things. When I stand up and I say that we will stop and I’ve said it, we will stop men from participating in women’s sports. I mean the whole thing.

Of course we’re for parental rights, but the Democrats aren’t. They’re fascists. They’re not. They want school boards. They want people to take your children and do things with your children that are not even speakable. Americans of faith are not a threat to our country. Americans of faith are the soul of our country, and they have been from the beginning. I will defend religion and I will defend in God we trust. We will defend, in God we trust, which is… And you know that very important phrase is under siege. You do know that, right? We will defend it 100%. When Joe Biden lit the national Christmas tree earlier this month, he completely failed to even mention the birth of Jesus Christ, which is hard to do if you’re celebrating Christmas, right? He didn’t mention Jesus Christ in his remarks. Not for three years. He hasn’t mentioned that and barely mentioned God.\n",

      "When I was president, we brought back the beautiful phrase, “Merry Christmas,” and I said I’d do that. I’m very proud of that actually, because as I said at the beginning, it was really under siege, and when I lit the Christmas tree each year, it was my honor to publicly celebrate the true source of Christmas joy, which is Jesus Christ. As president, I kept every promise I made to Christians and more, and I think everybody in this room understands that very well. That’s pretty well documented. In our first four years, we appointed nearly 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. I stood up for religious liberty at home and all around the world. I protected innocent life and I defended the Judeo-Christian values of our nation’s founding. I proudly recognized Israel’s eternal capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem, which is a big thing.\n",

Every year, they’d fly in, they’d discuss it, they’d fly out, and I got it done in about 12 minutes. We got it done very quickly. And with the historic Abraham Accords, I even made peace in the Middle East. Unfortunately, they haven’t taken it any further. It should have been taken. We could have had everybody signed up. It’s no wonder crooked Joe Biden and the far left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary.

I don’t know. That’s probably a little bit like the fake news would do, so I feel very embarrassed by it. But the new CBS poll just out has us at 58% of the state with the sanctimonious 40 points behind us, 40 points. The new Morning Consult \n",
      "… Paul, that’s in your state. The console, Paul has us at 66% nationwide with the DeSanctis at 11% and Haley at 11%. And then they said, “Haley is surging,” because she went from 9 to 11. I went up seven points. She went up two points, and it’s harder to go up seven when you’re almost at the top. There’s not that many points left. I went up seven, she went up two and the headline was, “Haley is surging because she caught De-Sanctimonious.” The Fox poll has us trouncing the primary field at 69% with the De-Sanctus at 13% and Haley at 9. It’s interesting, he did an interview the other day and the announcer, this was a straight interview at a major network, “Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great honor to have Governor Ron DeSanctis with us. No, no, it’s DeSantis.” So that’s good branding, do you agree? That’s good. Nah, but he is sanctimonious.\n",

Even as countries watch from afar, because we would never have any of these problems if our were president… But when they see the kind of support that we have, we have incredible support. We have more support than we did in 2020 or 2016, and we did great. We won 2016, and then we did even better by a lot, by millions and millions of votes in 2020, it was a rigged election.

Because when you add it all up, what we’ve done, unlike crooked Joe who wants to dramatically increase the estate tax or the death taxes, they call it, I virtually eliminated the unfair death tax, saving countless farms from families and families of farmers. They love their children, they leave their farm to the children, and the tax was so incredible that the children would often have to file bankruptcy because they had to go borrow money to pay the estate tax or the death tax. I eliminated that tax, I eliminated it. So, now you can leave, if you love your children… If you don’t love your children, then I haven’t done that much for you. But some people love their children.

Some of these big banks have been horrible, the horrible people running them. But the banks, they loan the money, and they end up taking over the farm. We’re not doing that. So, we ended the estate tax and farms and small businesses, now they don’t have to go into hock and end up losing everything, and the parents are very happy about that.

I took on the communist Chinese like no administration in history. Communist China was doing a number on the farmers, and you know it better than anybody, bringing hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our treasury when no other president had gotten 10 cents from China. Nobody had ever brought in any money. I brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. In fact, China’s not now doing very well, and a lot of people think it was because of what I did with respect to all of the hundreds of billions I brought in. Biden is unable to cancel it, because it’s so much money, that they’re having a hard time canceling it. So I just say, “Oh gee, let’s not do that for hundreds of billions of dollars.” Then I gave the farmers $28 billion straight out of the tariffs I took in from China, a large part of which came right back to the state of Iowa, right?\n",

But you know what? They stuck with me, because we had a period of six or seven months, which  the great negotiators, they were playing hardball, but we ended up winning and they buy now… We made a trade deal with John. I don’t even talk about it because of Covid, but we made one of the greatest trade deals ever made. They buy $50 billion worth of product from this country, and they were buying nothing before that. They were buying nothing.\n",

So, I will not guarantee it, but I pretty much guarantee it, okay? “Let’s vote against Trump because he gave us $28 billion.” I don’t know. Somehow they got a problem with that one, don’t they, huh, the people that are running against us and who, frankly, were not in favor of farmers. Ron De-Sanctimonious was not a friend of the farmer. He fought against the Farm Bill, he fought against ethanol, hard, very hard. Now all of a sudden, he loves ethanol. About two weeks ago it started, right? No one gets abused on trade worse than American agriculture, yet no other president lifted a finger for you. Nobody lifted a finger for you in Iowa, nobody. Under my leadership, we will have a great rebirth of loyalty to the American farmer and loyalty to the American flag. I’m going to pass something that’s so important. We were just about set to do that. We had the greatest economy in history. We’re just about set, and then we hit Covid. Covid came, a gift from China, from Wuhan. I told them it came from the Wuhan lab. I said it right from the beginning. I never changed. You ever see the heads, “Trump was right about everything.” Some of the things I don’t want to be right about, like I think our country’s in more danger now for World War III than ever before. I don’t want to be right about that, but we have a man who’s grossly incompetent and he’s talking about nuclear weapons and negotiations. He doesn’t even know what the hell he’s talking… He can’t even find the stairs to get off a stage, right? There they are. There they are. They’re all over the place.

What about that?” “I would like to tell you the following.” He’s reading the answer, meaning he knows the questions and they write down the answer. He reads the answer.

They’re coming in, they’re wiping it out like 158 pounds. It’s just so demeaning to women, the whole thing. I mean, women, great athletes. It’s just so unfair. They’re going to have records. Look, eventually that’s got to happen. It’s going to happen with me. But you’re going to have these records where the record will be here, but you’ll have this blip for a period of three or four years, like that. They’ll look back in a hundred years.

But until then, Republicans must win. We have to win. Once we get in, we’ll change that, but we have to win. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration has done. You take the 10. Remember, I used to say five. But you don’t have to say five. You could take the 10 worst presidents and they would not have done the damage that he’s done. So if you want to save America from Crooked Joe, then get every Patriot you know.

Worked the fields, built the factories and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to make this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now we are a nation in decline.

It’s the biggest thing.” “You fixed it, sir.” It was totally fixed. And then what happened is not even believable. This is the single biggest election in the history of our country.

      "No, they’re actually friends, enthusiastic friends. Then earlier this week, we had a spectacular victory in New Hampshire. We shattered the all-time record for the number of votes cast from either party. It has never happened in the entire history of the New Hampshire primary. We got the most votes ever gotten by anybody. That’s a good sign, and I’m proud that we’re the first non-incumbent, remember this, look at this, in either party to win both, think of this, Iowa and New Hampshire. We want them both quite easily. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:27)\n",
      "Now we’re going to have an even bigger victory right here in Nevada, perhaps the most astounding of all as we achieved our monumental victory in New Hampshire, despite the fact that more than 50% of the voters were not even Republican. They were Democrats and independent. That was a setup, and we still won by a record margin, over 70% of the votes cast. Oh, wow. I didn’t even know this fact. Did you hear this? 70% of the votes cast for Nikki Haley. Did anybody ever hear of her? Bird brain, Nikki.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:08)\n",
      "The Republican Party wanted to nominate me and just say, “Skip the whole thing, and we’re just going to give you our nomination.” I said, :Don’t do that. Don’t do that. I want to win it the fair way.” Pretty easy way, too, because we’re leading by so much. But over 70% of the votes cast for Nikki Haley on Tuesday came from outside of the Republican Party. They came from outside. She got about 24%, 25% Republican votes because they had liberals interfering on behalf. They had Democrats voting. They had everybody voting, and we still won by a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:46)\n",
      "That was the one shot. The message from the voters of our party is clear. It’s time to finish this primary and get going and defeating. You remember this. We all call it a primary, but I like calling it a caucus because it really is. Your primary vote doesn’t mean anything. It’s your caucus vote. So, in your state, you have both a primary and you have a caucus. Don’t worry about the primary. Just do the caucus thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:15)\n",
      "We’re going to go on to defeat crooked Joe Biden, and we’re going to, very simply, make America great again. Make America great again. So it’s very important to remember that you have a big thing coming up. Don’t waste your time on primary. Waste all of your time on caucus because the primary doesn’t mean anything. It’s psychologically maybe a little bit, about 2%, but it doesn’t mean anything.\n",

      "With the help of everyone here today, we’re going to secure a gigantic win in the Nevada caucuses on Thursday. So it’s Thursday, February 8th, right around the corner. We do want to get a good vote. We’re not going to have a lot of competition, I think. But it doesn’t matter. We want to get a great beautiful mandate. This November, we’re going to win the swing state of Nevada. You ever think of it as a swing state?\n",

We’re going to also take back that beautiful … Isn’t it one of the most beautiful places in the world? The White House. The White House. Victory cannot come soon enough. Under crooked Joe Biden, our country is dying. Our country is dying. Our border’s open and gushing. It’s a big gushing wound letting drugs, crime, and millions upon millions of illegal aliens pour into our country like we’ve never seen before. Nothing like this has ever happened to our country before.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:55)\n",
      "It’s also the number one place on Earth for a thing called human trafficking, number one place. Our border has become a weapon of mass destruction, our destruction. It’s a weapon of mass destruction. It’s our destruction. We’re destroying our country. As I’ve been saying for so many years, this is an invasion. It’s an invasion of our country. On behalf of all Americans who want a strong and secure border, I want to express our thanks to Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and the great state of Texas where we right now have about a 40-point lead for rightly invoking the invasion clause of the US Constitution.\n",

      "(06:44)\n",
      "It is an invasion. But we didn’t need to do it just three years ago. We didn’t need anybody’s help because we had the safest border in US history three years ago. We didn’t need anybody’s help. Today, we have a catastrophe waiting to happen. It’s a terrible situation. Never had anything like it before. It’s the worst border anywhere in the history of the world, and I believe that includes other countries. There’s never been a country where millions and millions of people are able to flow in with no vetting, no checking, no nothing.\n",

      "(07:16)\n",
      "We don’t know who they are. We don’t know where they come from. They’re pouring into our country, and they’re coming from prisons. They’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re human traffickers. They’re coming in. They’re drug dealers. They’re coming in. We have no idea, and we have no idea what we’re doing with our country. Our country’s going to hell because of incompetent or bad people.\n",

      "Terrorists are pouring in unchecked from all over the world. We have more terrorists now. I never really believed this fully, but I know we did a good job on it. In 2019, remember they said they had no terrorists. They do these checks. I don’t know. None sounds like something Trump would say, to be honest. They say, “Only Trump would say …” They actually have it down. It’s a report, and it says none. And then the following two years later, they have record number of terrorists now pouring into our … same report, record number of terrorists coming into our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:19)\n",
      "There’s a 100% chance that there will be a major terrorist attack in the United States or many attacks maybe, and it’s all because of what’s happened over the last three years. When I’m president, instead of trying to send Texas a restraining order, I will send them reinforcements.\n",

      "Instead of fighting border states, I will use every resource, tool, and authority of the US president to defend the United States of America from this horrible invasion that is taking place right now. There’s never been anything like it. Texas will be given full support, and I will deploy all necessary military and law enforcement resources to seal up the final section of border. We built over 500 miles of wall, fortunately. But what they’re doing is just not even … It’s not even believable.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:34)\n",
      "Usually, you like to know the other side, and you like to know where the other side’s coming from. Nobody, to this day, can explain why this open wound is good for our country and even politically. Why is it good politically? First of all, with the Hispanic vote, we’re doing better now than the Democrat Party. So I think it’s good for us. But we’re going to seal the border, complete it, and we’re going to repeal the invasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:03)\n",
      "Remember that in 2016 when I campaigned, everybody remembers that we had a very bad border, nothing like today. I solved the problem. Then when I ran in 2020, and by the way, got the most votes in the history of any sitting president running for president. We got the most vote. We got more votes than any other sitting president. Think of that. But we had a campaign, and we did great in that campaign. Frankly, we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016, but something happened. Not going to happen this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:39)\n",
      "Something happened. Bad, bad things happened. But anyway, but I didn’t have the border to run on because I did such a good job with the border that the border wasn’t an issue. I went backstage to all of my people. I said, “I want to talk about the border.” “Sir, nobody cares about the border. You solved the problem.” I said, “So I did such a good job, I took it out of play.” Now I’m saying the border is in play like it’s never been in play before because what they’ve done is they’ve taken all of the things that I did to make it so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:13)\n",
      "Literally, we couldn’t put it in a speech. Nobody wanted to hear about the border. We had no border problem. We had the strongest border we’ve ever had in history. But now we can talk about the border because it’s never ever been worse than it is now. I don’t think any border in the entire world has ever been worse. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones to keep people out in that kind … That’s incredible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:41)\n",
      "I believe that the number by the end of the Biden administration will be close to 18 million people. That’s bigger than New York state. I believe that’s going to be the real number. 18 million people. Who does it hurt the worst? African Americans and Hispanics. It hurts the Hispanics and the African Americans first. When you look at the poll numbers, how well we’re doing with Hispanics and African Americans, nobody’s ever seen anything like it. They’re a little concerned, the Democrats on the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:18)\n",
      "It was just announced that 302,000 illegal aliens trespassed across our border last month, 302,000. By the way, that’s an all-time record. There’s never been a number like that. Last month, 302,000, that’s bigger than most cities in our country. Yet unbelievably, rather than helping Texas to build our border security up, crooked Joe Biden is fighting Texas to tear our beautiful border security down. They’re cutting all the wire. Let’s cut the wire. Let everybody in.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:51)\n",
      "No, no. They want open borders. In three weeks, I would have been able to get another 150 miles of wall up. Think of that. The wall was there. All they had to do is put it up. It was all set to be put up, and you know what they did? They sold it for five cents on the dollar. They sold it as scrap. They want to have open borders, and you’re going to remember that come November. Now they’re trying to blame anybody that they can. They’re going to blame your great lieutenant governor who’s here. I appreciate it. We’re going to introduce him in a second.\n",

Look, Leo. They’re going to blame you, Leo. But Leo can handle it. That’s one thing. Leo can handle it. Thank you. But let there be no doubt. What Joe Biden is doing is a crime against our nation. It’s an absolute betrayal of our country, and it’s an atrocity against our Constitution. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:03)\n",
      "Crooked Joe will not get away with these crimes. He will be tried at the ballot box in November, and you will go back to having the strongest border, even stronger than I gave you. But we’ll take that, too. We’ll take anything when you look at what’s happened to our country. With your vote, he will be judged and convicted by the American people of this atrocity that he’s done. Nobody can believe what’s happened. Under the Trump administration, we ended catch and release. Remember catch and release.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:36)\n",
      "You know what release is? We release him into our country, criminals. “What do you do?” “I murdered someone.” Comes from a jail. We release them into our country. We got Mexico to send 28,000 troops. You remember this? 28,000 troops. You think that was easy, don’t you? It wasn’t easy. I had to tell the president of Mexico, “We want you to send us 28,000 troops.” He said, “You have to be kidding.” He’s a very smart guy. He actually is a great guy. I like him. He’s a socialist, but that’s okay. You can’t have everything.\n",

      "(15:08)\n",
      "But no, he’s a great guy. He said, “I’m not going to send you … Why would I send you 28,000?” Which is what anybody here would say. I said, “No, no, you will. 100% sure you will.” He said, “I’m not sending troops.” I said, “You will. You will. Send me your rep. I don’t want to get into an argument with you. I like you too much. Send me your top negotiator.” He sent this very handsome guy. He actually came into New York, and I met him in New York. Can you believe that?\n",

      "(15:33)\n",
      "We met during the United Nations, and I said, “We need 28,000 soldiers. We need Remain in Mexico. We need catch and release in Mexico.” This is now catch and release in Mexico. There’s a little difference, right, not catch and release in the USA. But I went to the Border Patrol, Brandon Judd, fantastic. I went to Tom Holman separately. I went to a whole group of incredible patriots. I said, “Give me the top 10 things.” I was dealing with a woman from the State Department who was a very quality woman, but a lousy negotiator.\n",

      "(16:06)\n",
      "She was there 24 years. She said, “I worked in Mexico for 24 years, sir. You’re not going to get any of these things.” I said, “Give me a top 10 list, top 10. Give me 10 things you want. I’ll get every one of them.” “Sir, you won’t.” They gave me a top 10 list. Brandon Judd, all the guys, they know exactly. They gave me that 10. I put it down, and I said, “I’ll get every one of these things.” And then he came in. The gentleman came in, tall, handsome, obviously from Mexico.\n",

I think it’s beautiful.” I said, “How much did you pay for your suit?” I said, “Now let’s get down to business. We want you to give us 28,000 soldiers, free of charge.” He said, “No, we’re not going to do that. Why the hell, sir? Why would we do that? I want to be respectful, sir. But we wouldn’t even think about that.” “Yes, you will, 100%.” He said, “No, no, we won’t.” I said, “You will.” He said, “No way.” I said, “Way.” And then I said, “I want you to have a policy now I’m going to institute. It’s called Remain in Mexico. They had to agree to it.” They said, “We’re not going to let you. You’re talking about hundreds of thousands of people.” I said, “Maybe millions because the way they’re coming up in the caravans.” A name I came up with, by the way, I’m very proud of that name.\n",

      "(17:23)\n",
      "I came up with fake news. Look at all the fake news back there. I came up with a lot of good names. I came up with a lot of good names. I said, “No, we want a Remain in Mexico policy.” Nobody ever even heard of that, Remain … It sounds nice, right? Not remain in the USA, remain in Mexico until they can be vetted, which might take about three years. I said, “Remain in Mexico. I want catch and release in Mexico.” I wanted Title 42 to keep people that had big problems out.\n",

On Monday morning at 7:00 in the morning, every single item, especially the cars that you stole out of the USA to manufacture them in Mexico, every single thing that comes into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff. In two weeks, if you don’t approve it, in two weeks, the 25 goes to 50%, every single item. So we want 28,000 soldiers. We want Remain in Mexico. We want catch and release in Mexico. We want all of these things.”\n",

He comes back in about two minutes. “Sir, it would be our great honor to supply the United States with 28,000 soldier. Great honor.

I’m not predicting it, but I’m saying you’re very close. We have a man negotiating for us who can’t put two sentences together. He can’t see the stage.

Kim Jong-Un North Korea, he’s negotiating. I did a good job with Kim Jong-Un. We had a very good relationship. People don’t like it when I say that, but we were very safe when I was your president. You’re not safe now, but you’re very close to a third world war. And the bombs are starting to drop all over the Middle East again. You see that, right?

I used to say, “Why don’t we use these great medicines?” “Sir, we can’t use them. People may get hurt.” “No, these are people that are terminally ill.” They didn’t want to do it because the insurance companies had a problem. The labs had a problem, doctors had a problem, and the country had a problem. One of the people said, “We don’t want to get sued if they die,” but they’re going to die anyway. So I said, “Why?” They’ve been trying to get this for 71 years approved. I gots go Right To Try.

What they’ve done, and in the old days, which was six years ago, people would go, they’d go to Asia, they’d go to Europe, they’d go all over the world looking for a cure, and they’d usually come back home and die.

You had actual numbers where they were the best till that time. We’re blowing them away and we’re blowing them away with African-American people who are the single most affected people by what’s happening at our border, African American, number one, Hispanic American, number two. They are being horribly threatened because of what’s happening, because millions of people are pouring in and the real number is 18,000,000.

I noticed that, and I’ll fight it all the way. I noticed a lot of the senators, a lot of the senators are trying to say respectfully, they’re blaming it on me. I said, “That’s okay. Please blame it on me, please,” because they were getting ready to pass a very bad bill. And I’ll tell you what a bad bill is… I’d rather have no bill than a bad bill. A bad bill, you can’t have.

But this is the single greatest threat to our country right now, is the people pouring into our country because we have no idea who they are. The fact is that if Joe Biden truly wanted to secure the border, he doesn’t really need a bill. I didn’t need a bill. I did it without a bill. I did it with the current laws. I used border patrol. I didn’t have a bill. I didn’t need lots of different things. It’s not that complicated. You say, “I don’t want the people coming in.” They say, “Yes, sir, there won’t be any people coming in.” And that’s what we did. It’s not that complicated.

Just yesterday, Biden blocked the export of American natural gas to other countries. He doesn’t want plants built in the United States, even though that’s the best thing you could do. This stuff has been worked on for years. I approved many of them. We got many built in Louisiana and other places, but he stopped it. Now, why he stopped it? I guess it was the environmentalists. But it’s good for the environment, not bad and good for our country.\n",

Five years ago, they were all pushing for this store to open. They open, now people are just walking in and robbing it. You can solve that in one hour. All you do is one hour. You have to treat the first one out the door the next time it happens extremely tough.

This is not just New York, all over the place. It’s like a new form of crime. They walk in, they just take a bag. In some of these places, they don’t prosecute you unless it’s more than 2,000. In other words, you could take $2,000, anything more than that. But even that, they won’t do anything. Guys walk in with bags.

So I’m going in, I’m going to a federal courthouse, which is in bad shape, very bad shape. But going there, I’m writing over paper, paper that’s been laying on the roadway.

If we ever get it straighter, we will because I’m going to sign it right away. But when that’s straight, women are going to look back and they’re going to say, “Who the hell was it? That’s 142 pounds more.” So we’re going to have to bring back those records, I think. What do you think? Yes.

Because if we don’t have fair and honest elections and if we don’t have border security, if we don’t have strong borders and strong elections, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country.

You do a new computer, it’s obsolete in three days. Walls and wheels. You always have walls and wheels. A wall has worked for a long time. Our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID. But until then, Republicans, you have to win, Republicans. Go out and win. When we get in there, we’re changing it around.

      "Well, first of all, I think he’s been a disaster as a president. He’s the worst president in the history of our country. The happiest person around right now is Jimmy Carter, I’ve been saying this, because he looks like a brilliant president by comparison, literally brilliant by comparison to this guy. There’s never been anybody like him. Now we have another war going on in the Middle East, just started up, and we have our Secretary of Defense is sitting in a hospital room looking at his laptop. That’s how he’s running the war, like a child would look at a laptop. It’s disgraceful what’s going on. It’s a disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:23)\n",
      "And Bidenomics is the least of it, but it’s been a disaster for the country. Inflation’s now going up again. But really, look at the inflation that’s taken place over the last three years. I was looking today. Energy’s up at 38% and food’s up 30, 32%. Everything’s up. It’s not going to come down. They’re not going to get it down. Even if they got it even right now, it doesn’t matter. The damage is all done. No matter what you make and no matter how much your salary went up, it’s peanuts compared to when you look at all these things. They were talking about housing prices. They were talking about rental. If you rent an apartment anywhere in the country, you’re up 40%, and that you can’t make up for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:05)\n",
      "He’s been a disaster as a president. We’re spending money hand over fist, and Ukraine as an example, and yet Europe, you add it up, it’s a similar size economy as ours, Europe is not spending anything by comparison. We’re in for $200 billion. They’re in for $22 billion. And yet it certainly affects them more than it affects us. We have a thing called an ocean in between. They don’t have that ocean. And nobody’s telling them to do it. I told them to spend for NATO. I said, “You have to spend money.” And they said, “Well, I don’t really know. Would you protect us?” I said, “No. If you don’t spend, we’re not going to protect you.” And all of a sudden, billions and hundreds of billions came pouring into NATO because I said that. You have to ask them for the money. They’ll pay it if you ask them. I don’t think anybody is asking them.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:49)\n",
      "But you look at the difference between what we’re spending on Ukraine, as an example, and what they’re spending, and the only difference is nobody’s asking or they don’t know how to ask. But you really probably have to tell them, “This is what you’re going to do,” and they’ll do it. So it’s a very unfair thing. Very bad things are happening for our country. I don’t think we’ve ever been in danger of World War III like we are right now. And I always say, and I say it in every speech, I will prevent World War III. I know all these people. I know good, bad or indifferent, it doesn’t make any difference, I know every one of them, and they’re not going to mess around with us. We are weak. We are ineffective. We’re left out as a country. And Bidenomics is a total disaster to get back to your original question.\n",

      "Well, you’d have the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. It will be devastating to people on top of inflation and what’s happened, and basically a bad economy. It’s a bad economy. It’s not a real economy. You look at government jobs are up, but other jobs aren’t up. But government jobs, well, government jobs, that’s easy to do. “Let’s hire more people so we look good.” That’s like taking the oil out of the strategic reserves. They take it out of the big… We have the lowest amount of oil in the strategic reserves right now than we’ve ever had. And that’s not meant for automobiles for an election. That’s meant for military. That’s meant for trouble, big trouble in our country. It’s meant to protect us. And they practically drained it in the last election in order to keep prices down. They’re trying to do the same thing again. They have done such damage to our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:17)\n",
      "And then we start talking about the border. Okay? The border. We have the worst border in the history of the world. We had the safest border, the best border. I built over 500 miles of wall. People, they say, “Is it a renovation or not a…” It’s not a renovation. We had a wall that was falling down, demolished, rusted steel, rotted out two-by-fours. We’d rip it out. They’d say, “Oh, that was a renovation,” when we go up 30 feet high and nine feet deep. Now, we built over 500 miles of wall. We were going to build another 200 miles, which is far more than I said I was going to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:50)\n",
      "By the way, you’re speaking about Mexico, Mexico paid for 28,000 soldiers, and they were paying much more money than they would have paid for the wall. There was no legal mechanism to do the wall, but it didn’t matter because they paid much more money. We had stay in Mexico, not stay. We had stay in Mexico. We kept people in Mexico. Nobody ever did that before. And Mexico behaved, but Mexico had to behave because I was going to tariff them if they didn’t. And they were fine. They were actually very good. I like the president a lot. I mean, we get along very well. But Mexico paid a big price to give us the best border that we’ve ever had in the history of our country. That included drugs, that included terrorists coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:29)\n",
      "I saw an interesting stat on a number of the shows. In 2019, they had no terrorists, zero, which I was frankly surprised to hear that, but that was during my term. We had very strong blockages and blocks, so we had nothing. And now we have record numbers of terrorists coming in. Record numbers. We had none. I mean, they actually said zero. This is not me, because I would have said, “There’s got to be somebody. Somebody.” But they had nobody. We had a safe country. We had no attacks, we had no anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:59)\n",
      "I defeated ISIS. We wiped out ISIS. That was supposed to take four years. I did it in a few months. We have a great military when we have the right people. And we have the right people. I know the right people. They’re not the television people, not the people that you’re reading about, not the person that’s now in a hospital running this war from his laptop, which is what I understand he’s doing, if he’s running it at all. I’m not sure about that. But that was a terrible thing. Five days, we didn’t have any idea where our Secretary of Defense was, and we had people wanting to attack our country. So it’s a pretty sad situation. We’ve never been in a position of risk like we are right now, in many ways, but never like we are right now.\n",

      "And it’s very interesting because if he just would have left it, he could have gone to the beach, because he likes going to the beach. Somebody says he looks good in a bathing suit. That works for him, obviously. So you’d see him at the beach all the time. He could have done that, just left it alone, leave our people there, leave the great people that we had there, and instead they decided to, “We’re not going to build the wall.” And they put out a message to the world, “Come in.” Because when you say that and you say other things and you have people coming in and going to our schools and taking the places of our students, where they’re actually putting our students, the students that were there, in secondary schools, and they’re taking the best seats. And they don’t even speak English. So they’re sitting there, they don’t speak English. The whole thing is crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:37)\n",
      "You look at what’s happened in New York. New York is a disaster right now. In all fairness, the mayor understands that and he’s saying that, but some don’t speak up, some aren’t speaking up. The whole concept of sanctuary cities, I think it’s going to fall of its own weight. I think the Democrats aren’t going to be able to take it much longer. In some cities, Democrat mayors and governors are saying, “We just can’t do this anymore.” The truth is it’s not sustainable for this country, even from a cost standpoint, billions and billions of dollars. People are coming in and they’re coming in from prisons, they’re coming in from mental institutions, insane asylums. They’re terrorists. They’re drug dealers. They’re pouring into our country totally unchecked. We have no idea who’s coming in.\n",

      "They’re coming in from many countries, all parts of the world. They’re coming from Africa, they’re coming from China, they’re coming from all parts of Asia. A lot of people coming from Europe. A lot of people coming from Yemen, okay, where we’re bombing right now. We have people from Yemen. We had 26, 27,000 people coming in over the last few months from China, and they happened to be from the age of about 19 to 25, fighting age. That’s great. Not women, all men. And it’s a very, very sad thing happening to our country. Our country is being overtaken. We’re being invaded. That’s an invasion. We had the strongest border. Now we have the weakest border, and it’s an invasion of our country. Biden is grossly incompetent. The only thing they know how to do is cheat in elections. They’re very good at cheating in elections, and they’re very good at also going after your political opponent, but they can’t do anything else. That’s all they’re good at.

We had a lot of wall built. It’s laying there ready to be lifted up. They could have had it completed in three weeks. And if you remember, because I remember it, it was all ready to go, and they said, “We don’t want it.” And they actually moved the wall away. And in many cases it’s very expensive stuff. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. It’s steel, concrete and rebar. It had to have spikes in it. It’s a very complicated wall, it’s a very expensive… They sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. They got rid of it, I think, like scrap metal. And it’s not even believable. All they had to do is fill up the gaps.\n",

      "(11:32)\n",
      "We’re going to fill up the gaps and we’re going to end up actually building more. We’re going to work with Mexico. But Mexico is not working with us right now. They want to be paid a lot of money. They said, “We want $5 billion to start talking to the United States.” They would never say that to me. The people are pouring through Mexico and they want five to talk. Every time Blinken goes over there or somebody goes over there, it costs us a lot of money.

I always did, and I always will. And frankly, we spend trillions of dollars to other countries. Many of these countries don’t respect us. They don’t like us. They don’t do what we tell them to do. And I stopped that whole process. But Nikki is a person that’s getting a lot of her money from globalists. And globalists are not good for our country. They’re not good for us.

But it was certainly a hot mic. I don’t think Nikki’s strong enough to be president. I know her very well. I know her better than anybody. I moved her there from the Governor of South Carolina and I moved Henry McMaster in. And one of the reasons I gave her that job is I wanted Henry McMaster to be governor. He was Lieutenant Governor.

China has that kind of wealth because they have the battery wealth, but electric cars don’t go far, they’re very expensive and they’re going to all be made in China. That’s why, I think, we had a pole just come out and we’re 11 points up in Michigan because the auto workers and South Carolina, way up to wherever you make autos, because the auto workers understand, if you go all electric, you’re making those cars in China.

And on gasoline, you take a Peterbilt or one of the great companies that really do great jobs, they’ll go 2000 miles.

      "Well, first of all, I think he’s been a disaster as a president. He’s the worst president in the history of our country. The happiest person around right now is Jimmy Carter, I’ve been saying this, because he looks like a brilliant president by comparison, literally brilliant by comparison to this guy. There’s never been anybody like him. Now we have another war going on in the Middle East, just started up, and we have our Secretary of Defense is sitting in a hospital room looking at his laptop. That’s how he’s running the war, like a child would look at a laptop. It’s disgraceful what’s going on. It’s a disgrace.\n",

      "And Bidenomics is the least of it, but it’s been a disaster for the country. Inflation’s now going up again. But really, look at the inflation that’s taken place over the last three years. I was looking today. Energy’s up at 38% and food’s up 30, 32%. Everything’s up. It’s not going to come down. They’re not going to get it down. Even if they got it even right now, it doesn’t matter. The damage is all done. No matter what you make and no matter how much your salary went up, it’s peanuts compared to when you look at all these things. They were talking about housing prices. They were talking about rental. If you rent an apartment anywhere in the country, you’re up 40%, and that you can’t make up for that.\n",

      "He’s been a disaster as a president. We’re spending money hand over fist, and Ukraine as an example, and yet Europe, you add it up, it’s a similar size economy as ours, Europe is not spending anything by comparison. We’re in for $200 billion. They’re in for $22 billion. And yet it certainly affects them more than it affects us. We have a thing called an ocean in between. They don’t have that ocean. And nobody’s telling them to do it. I told them to spend for NATO. I said, “You have to spend money.” And they said, “Well, I don’t really know. Would you protect us?” I said, “No. If you don’t spend, we’re not going to protect you.” And all of a sudden, billions and hundreds of billions came pouring into NATO because I said that. You have to ask them for the money. They’ll pay it if you ask them. I don’t think anybody is asking them.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But you look at the difference between what we’re spending on Ukraine, as an example, and what they’re spending, and the only difference is nobody’s asking or they don’t know how to ask. But you really probably have to tell them, “This is what you’re going to do,” and they’ll do it. So it’s a very unfair thing. Very bad things are happening for our country. I don’t think we’ve ever been in danger of World War III like we are right now. And I always say, and I say it in every speech, I will prevent World War III. I know all these people. I know good, bad or indifferent, it doesn’t make any difference, I know every one of them, and they’re not going to mess around with us. We are weak. We are ineffective. We’re left out as a country. And Bidenomics is a total disaster to get back to your original question. \n",
      "Well, you’d have the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. It will be devastating to people on top of inflation and what’s happened, and basically a bad economy. It’s a bad economy. It’s not a real economy. You look at government jobs are up, but other jobs aren’t up. But government jobs, well, government jobs, that’s easy to do. “Let’s hire more people so we look good.” That’s like taking the oil out of the strategic reserves. They take it out of the big… We have the lowest amount of oil in the strategic reserves right now than we’ve ever had. And that’s not meant for automobiles for an election. That’s meant for military. That’s meant for trouble, big trouble in our country. It’s meant to protect us. And they practically drained it in the last election in order to keep prices down. They’re trying to do the same thing again. They have done such damage to our country.\n",

      "And then we start talking about the border. Okay? The border. We have the worst border in the history of the world. We had the safest border, the best border. I built over 500 miles of wall. People, they say, “Is it a renovation or not a…” It’s not a renovation. We had a wall that was falling down, demolished, rusted steel, rotted out two-by-fours. We’d rip it out. They’d say, “Oh, that was a renovation,” when we go up 30 feet high and nine feet deep. Now, we built over 500 miles of wall. We were going to build another 200 miles, which is far more than I said I was going to do.\n",

      " \n",
      "By the way, you’re speaking about Mexico, Mexico paid for 28,000 soldiers, and they were paying much more money than they would have paid for the wall. There was no legal mechanism to do the wall, but it didn’t matter because they paid much more money. We had stay in Mexico, not stay. We had stay in Mexico. We kept people in Mexico. Nobody ever did that before. And Mexico behaved, but Mexico had to behave because I was going to tariff them if they didn’t. And they were fine. They were actually very good. I like the president a lot. I mean, we get along very well. But Mexico paid a big price to give us the best border that we’ve ever had in the history of our country. That included drugs, that included terrorists coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "I saw an interesting stat on a number of the shows. In 2019, they had no terrorists, zero, which I was frankly surprised to hear that, but that was during my term. We had very strong blockages and blocks, so we had nothing. And now we have record numbers of terrorists coming in. Record numbers. We had none. I mean, they actually said zero. This is not me, because I would have said, “There’s got to be somebody. Somebody.” But they had nobody. We had a safe country. We had no attacks, we had no anything.\n",

      "I defeated ISIS. We wiped out ISIS. That was supposed to take four years. I did it in a few months. We have a great military when we have the right people. And we have the right people. I know the right people. They’re not the television people, not the people that you’re reading about, not the person that’s now in a hospital running this war from his laptop, which is what I understand he’s doing, if he’s running it at all. I’m not sure about that. But that was a terrible thing. Five days, we didn’t have any idea where our Secretary of Defense was, and we had people wanting to attack our country. So it’s a pretty sad situation. We’ve never been in a position of risk like we are right now, in many ways, but never like we are right now. \n",
      "And it’s very interesting because if he just would have left it, he could have gone to the beach, because he likes going to the beach. Somebody says he looks good in a bathing suit. That works for him, obviously. So you’d see him at the beach all the time. He could have done that, just left it alone, leave our people there, leave the great people that we had there, and instead they decided to, “We’re not going to build the wall.” And they put out a message to the world, “Come in.” Because when you say that and you say other things and you have people coming in and going to our schools and taking the places of our students, where they’re actually putting our students, the students that were there, in secondary schools, and they’re taking the best seats. And they don’t even speak English. So they’re sitting there, they don’t speak English. The whole thing is crazy.\n",

      "You look at what’s happened in New York. New York is a disaster right now. In all fairness, the mayor understands that and he’s saying that, but some don’t speak up, some aren’t speaking up. The whole concept of sanctuary cities, I think it’s going to fall of its own weight. I think the Democrats aren’t going to be able to take it much longer. In some cities, Democrat mayors and governors are saying, “We just can’t do this anymore.” The truth is it’s not sustainable for this country, even from a cost standpoint, billions and billions of dollars. People are coming in and they’re coming in from prisons, they’re coming in from mental institutions, insane asylums. They’re terrorists. They’re drug dealers. They’re pouring into our country totally unchecked. We have no idea who’s coming in.\n",

      "They’re coming in from many countries, all parts of the world. They’re coming from Africa, they’re coming from China, they’re coming from all parts of Asia. A lot of people coming from Europe. A lot of people coming from Yemen, okay, where we’re bombing right now. We have people from Yemen. We had 26, 27,000 people coming in over the last few months from China, and they happened to be from the age of about 19 to 25, fighting age. That’s great. Not women, all men. And it’s a very, very sad thing happening to our country. Our country is being overtaken. We’re being invaded. That’s an invasion. We had the strongest border. Now we have the weakest border, and it’s an invasion of our country. Biden is grossly incompetent. The only thing they know how to do is cheat in elections. They’re very good at cheating in elections, and they’re very good at also going after your political opponent, but they can’t do anything else. That’s all they’re good at. And we’re going to teach them a lesson. \n",
      "Right? \n",
      "Well, we’d go right back to what we were doing. Again, we had the safest border in the history of our country. And we’re going to close up the walls. We had 200 miles of walls. We had a lot of wall built. It’s laying there ready to be lifted up. They could have had it completed in three weeks. And if you remember, because I remember it, it was all ready to go, and they said, “We don’t want it.” And they actually moved the wall away. And in many cases it’s very expensive stuff. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. It’s steel, concrete and rebar. It had to have spikes in it. It’s a very complicated wall, it’s a very expensive… They sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. They got rid of it, I think, like scrap metal. And it’s not even believable. All they had to do is fill up the gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "We’re going to fill up the gaps and we’re going to end up actually building more. We’re going to work with Mexico. But Mexico is not working with us right now. They want to be paid a lot of money. They said, “We want $5 billion to start talking to the United States.” They would never say that to me. The people are pouring through Mexico and they want five to talk. Every time Blinken goes over there or somebody goes over there, it costs us a lot of money. The money that we spend dealing with countries, we give them \n",
      "… And billions and billions of dollars and then they don’t listen to us. They don’t do what we say. And I remember when China, China respected us three years ago, a lot. They really respected us. And the first meeting they had where they were lectured to by President Xi and China, we were lectured like we were children. And that would never happen with me. And it never did. \n",
      "Well, she’s a globalist and she works with Koch, used to be Koch brothers. David Koch I knew very well, was a nice guy, a member of my clubs and everything else. He was a big supporter in that way, but they’re globalists. I’m not. I’m a make America great again. I’m America first. People, just America first. It’s so simple. I put America first. I always did, and I always will. And frankly, we spend trillions of dollars to other countries. Many of these countries don’t respect us. They don’t like us. They don’t do what we tell them to do. And I stopped that whole process. But Nikki is a person that’s getting a lot of her money from globalists. And globalists are not good for our country. They’re not good for us. I know Nikki very well. She was my ambassador to the United Nations, and she had a lot of weakness to be honest.\n",

I hope we’re going to win it. But he made some statements, said she’s not going to make it, the so-called hot mic. And I don’t know if that was a hot mic on purpose or not. I doubt it. But it was certainly a hot mic. I don’t think Nikki’s strong enough to be president. I know her very well. I know her better than anybody. I moved her there from the Governor of South Carolina and I moved Henry McMaster in. And one of the reasons I gave her that job is I wanted Henry McMaster to be governor. He was Lieutenant Governor. He’s fantastic. You know him and he’s done a great job. But that was one of the reasons I moved her. And she did okay. She was okay, but she’s not strong enough to be president. I know her very well. \n",
      "I think we’re the closest that we’ve ever been. And Joe, this won’t be a regular war. This is not going to be, as I say, army tanks running back and forth shooting each other. These are weapons of mass destruction, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen. I’ve seen, I’ve seen them. And this is obliteration. This is not a world war like we are used to. World War I, World War II were terrible, horrible. This is so much bigger than that. This is like annihilation. And we have people that can’t put two sentences together. Our president can’t speak, he can’t speak a full sentence. And he’s negotiating with Putin and he’s negotiating with President Xi of China, who’s very tough and very smart. I say that and the media says, “Oh, you called him smart.” Yeah, he’s smart. He’s very smart. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I’d say that’s smart. And he’s a guy who loves China.\n",

We were doing things, this country that nobody’s ever seen. Then COVID came in. We did a great job with that, but never got the respect for the job we did with COVID. Nobody knew what it was. All over the world, it was ripping countries apart. The damage China did, and I always said it came from Wuhan and it did. It came from Wuhan and it was the damage done to this world, $61 trillion they figure. That’s more than China has. That’s more than everybody has put together $ 61 trillion in damage. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard that number, and it’s probably a relatively accurate number. They really put the world back many, many years, what they’ve done.\n",

We give the largest regulation cuts in history, even from a health standpoint, right to try. We did right to try. That space age stuff, we have the best labs, the best doctors in the world, and we’d have things that won’t come out for four or five or six years. They won’t be approved. And I got it done and they’ve been trying to get that done for 54 years. I got it done and it saved thousands and thousands of lives. Nobody wanted it. The health companies didn’t want it. The labs didn’t want it, the doctors didn’t want it, and the country didn’t want it because everybody felt they were going to have liability.\n",

      "I got everybody in a room, the insurance companies didn’t want it. I got them in a room and I said, look, the patient’s going to sign. No liability to anybody. And they were willing to do that. And we’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives. And it’s shown in many cases that the drugs really work. The drug companies didn’t want it because they didn’t want to take terminally ill people, the people that were terminal. And it was incredible. They’d say for years, we don’t want to take a chance because if they get sick … I said, they’re terminal. It’s like, these are really sick people. These are people that will be dead. They are dying and they will have the right to use it. And they have had, and we’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives. And actually it’s been the opposite effect. Some of these drugs are so good that it actually proved that they were good as opposed to the liability factor that the drug companies were worried about.\n",

      "So we’re very proud of everything we did. We’re the greatest economy in the history of our country. And again, the biggest tax cuts in history. And that is substantially bigger than Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts. And he did it. Now the Democrats want to have that elapse. It expires relatively soon, and that was a five-year deal. It expires. And if that’s allowed to expire, your taxes are going to go up at numbers that nobody … The biggest tax increase in history. And it’ll also be very bad for the economy, for the country.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "It’s interesting, when I cut the taxes to that tremendous extent, including for businesses, everybody said, “Oh wow, it’s not going to be income.” We take in much more income now than we did before with the higher tax rates. If they allow that to expire, which they’d like to do, I believe, I think they have a tremendous liability.

If you vote for him, and remember this, he got a lot of money from China. He got a lot of money from Ukraine. He got a lot of money from Russia. Do you remember during the debate when I said, how come you got $3.5 million from the Mayor of Moscow’s wife? And Chris Wallace wouldn’t let me ask that question. He said, “Well, I have to stop you.” What does that? Well, that’s become a very big subject. Why did he get it? And he can’t answer why he got it. But we have sort of a Manchurian candidate in there.

And I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, hundreds of billions. No other president ever took in 10 cents. And I got along great with President Xi until COVID. That was a step too far, I couldn’t do it. But I had a great relationship with him. But he was not thrilled with the tariffs. But we took in hundreds of billions of dollars, think of it. And no other president ever took in not 10 cents. And we were really rocking and rolling. And then this guy comes into office and it’s so bad. And we’re laughing stock as a country, as you know. We’re laughing stock all over the world. Very sad. Thank you, Joe. \n",

They defeated Napoleon. That’s what they do. A friend of mine, a great guy, a lot of people maybe think he’s a little tough, but that’s okay, Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary, he knows those countries very well. He’s right there. He knows them very, very well. Intimately. And he will tell you, Russia is this monster machine. We knock out 60 tanks and everybody’s bragging about the 60 tanks, but they’ve got 12,000 more tanks right behind them, 12,000. And they actually have a lot more than that.

And I said, “Don’t ever do it. Don’t ever do it.” And we had great talks about it. He would’ve never done it. And he wouldn’t have done it for two reasons. Number one, because I said, don’t do it. But you know what else? I had it down at $40 a barrel. As soon as I got out, Biden did horrible moves, and it went to $100 a barrel. At $100 a barrel he was making so much money, he had the money to prosecute the war. So that was another … He wouldn’t have done it anyway.\n",

They were dead flat broke. And I said to China, and I said to other countries, if you buy oil for Iran, you cannot do anything having to do with the US. You cannot do any business with us. You’re out of business. And they all make money with us. They do a lot of trade. And most of their trade deals are negotiated by other people and they weren’t the greatest.

They gave them 6 billion for five hostages. Those are must be pretty important hostages. Two of them were hikers. Two of them were … Hey, if you decide to go hiking in Iran, you have a liability.

But I’d say, don’t ever go into Iraq. But if you do go in, keep the oil. Remember that? Keep the oil if you go in, but don’t do it. But if you do, keep the oil. They didn’t keep the oil.\n",

She was the governor of South Carolina. You shouldn’t be leading by 60 points, they don’t like her. But we should be able to.

I don’t know the poll, there’s so many polling companies, but they’re all very good. We had one fake poll that came out of CNN and Fox puts it on, everybody puts it on, they’re so happy. But even that, I was leading by nine points. It’s pretty good when you’re leading by nine points, this is in New Hampshire. In Iowa, I’m leading by 30 and 35 and 40 points in every poll. They can’t find a bad one, so they try and report it as little as possible. But here, we’re leading big. In New Hampshire, I think we’re leading really big, outside of one fake poll, fake news CNN. And that’s why nobody watches it anymore, right? \n",
      "But we’re doing great in New Hampshire also, I think. Really good. \n",
      "First of all, you’ve earned it. I mean, they’ve earned it. They want to cut it and they also want, the Medicare, they want to cut that. And why are you doing this? We have more liquid gold right under our feet. We have so much wealth in this country and we don’t want to do it. We want to go to all electric cars so that we don’t use our wealth. China has that kind of wealth because they have the battery wealth, but electric cars don’t go far, they’re very expensive and they’re going to all be made in China. That’s why, I think, we had a pole just come out and we’re 11 points up in Michigan because the auto workers and South Carolina, way up to wherever you make autos, because the auto workers understand, if you go all electric, you’re making those cars in China. They’re not going to be made here. They’re going to be made in China.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And in addition to that, you should be able to buy electric cars, but you have to buy gasoline, combustion. You have to buy anything you want. You shouldn’t be restricting it to electric. You go to California, I was there this summer, and you have blackouts and brownouts all the time and now we’re supposed to, they want all their cars to be electric. The problem is with the car, the batteries are very somewhat expensive, but they can be very dangerous, you know that. And they can be very big, they take up a lot of room.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Like they want to go all electric trucks and half of the capacity that the truck is supposed to use for load is going to be a battery. But the other problem is, they just don’t go far. They just don’t go far. A truck will go 300 miles, a big an 18 wheeler, will go 300 miles. And on gasoline, you take a Peterbilt or one of the great companies that really do great jobs, they’ll go 2000 miles. So you go 2000 miles on diesel and the tank for the diesel is very small compared to the battery. The battery to go even three or 400 miles is much, much bigger than the tank.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So they’re going to have to devote a lot of that. And on some of the things that I stop, they want to go all electric army tanks. Okay? The problem is they don’t go far and it’s a different kind of power also, by the way. But they don’t go far. You say, what are they doing? And I somewhat joke, I’m trying to be sarcastic about it. I say, they go into an obliterated country, an enemy, because they want to make the atmosphere nice and safe, nice and clean. We want a pure clean atmosphere as we knock the country to hell. The whole thing is crazy and the battery is so big that to do it properly, they’d have to pull a truck behind it to carry the batteries. Can you believe it? \n",
      "So they want to do that. They want to do the boats. Now, they want to do boats. They want boats to be all electric. The whole thing is so crazy. I call it the Green New Scam. Not the Green New Deal, it’s the Green New Scam. \n",
      "And election fraud. \n",
      "He’s a fraud. No, it’s never happened before in the history. It’s happened in third-world countries. It happens in banana republics, never happened in this country, at least, nothing like this. And they go and you see what’s going on. Look at it as an example because it’s all coordinated. Look at Georgia, what happened there? And now that’s turned into a massive scandal where the prosecutor was getting all sorts of money. I think that deranged Jack Smith is a totally compromised prosecutor. I mean, he’s got some bad stuff, really bad stuff and dangerous stuff for the country. But these are bad people. They’re really bad people and they’ve never done this before. When a candidate is willing to weaponize against his political opponent, you no longer really have a democracy. And I think I’m doing very well with it.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "It’s very interesting. I don’t think it’s ever happened before to another candidate where something like this would happen on obviously, a much smaller scale, but they announced on one of the networks today that I’m leading by more than any candidate has ever led in history. Now we still have to go out and vote because we have to do it with facts. Polls don’t mean anything. But in the polls, we have the best numbers ever. I don’t believe I’d have numbers as high. I think I’d be leading by a lot ’cause we did a great job. They’re going on what we did altogether, but I don’t think I’d be leading by anywhere near as much. When you see a national poll came out today, I’m at 71. Rhonda Sanctimonious is at like, nine and I think, Nikki’s at nine or 10, and she may be replacing him. He’s gone through about $250 million and he’s only gone down. So there’s something wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But if they didn’t weaponize, I probably wouldn’t be doing as well. So that tells you the people understand it. I got all these judges, they hate me. Like in New York, they hate me. It’s radical left. Crazy judges, they’re crazy. And you take a look at what’s happening. You have trials and they give you a verdict before the trial starts. They gave me a verdict in New York before the trial starts. I had another one. I have to go and I said, “Could we have a day off? My wife’s incredible mother, this was an incredible woman. My wife loves her so much.” The first lady, her mother died and one of the most incredible people. And the judge says, “Essentially, you can’t go to the funeral. We’re not going to give you the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So if I go to the funeral, I can’t be at the trial. They’re not going to hold up the trial. Now think of it. This is a radical left Judge Kaplan. This is a radical left judge appointed by Clinton, and that’s the way it is. The Democrats play that way. The Republicans don’t. Republican judges, in all fairness, they go overboard. If I appoint somebody, they go overboard to give the other side the benefit of the doubt. Okay? Absolutely overboard. Whereas the Democrats, if you get appointed by Obama or Biden, they’re down and dirty. They say, “I don’t care.” It’s a whole different thing. And people can say that’s not true, but it’s totally true. Republicans, they want to go out of their way to show that they’re not influenced or they’re not biased or that they’re fair and they’re really hurting our country.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "The Democrats are, you just see it in New York. You see these judges. He gives me a verdict that I’m guilty and my lawyers go up. We don’t even know how has it happened? The trial didn’t start. He knows nothing about me. They don’t have the facts. They have the figure. Then they say about Mar-a-Lago, the judge ruled it was worth $18 million. What it’s actually worth, over a billion dollars. He said, $18 million. And everyone says, “How’d you get that?” Now, it’s an incredible property. It’s just a question of what’s it worth? People come in, it’s worth a lot of money. He said it was worth $18 million. That’s a lot of money too, but in Palm Beach, it’s not. In Palm Beach, it’s less than a starter house. It’s crazy, right? Palm Beach, Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But they make corrupt rulings in order to try and prove their case. And they do it and they do it against us. And the system, the legal system, is a mess in our country. It’s a mess. Absolutely, it’s a disgrace what’s going on with judges. And again, Democrat judges, especially the radical left Democrats, say what you want. I was scolded once by a certain Supreme Court justice, who I like and respect. He said, “No, no. You have Trump judges, you have Obama judges, you have judges. They’re all judges. They’re all essentially, the same.” I said, “I disagree with that. It’s just the way it is. I disagree.” Republican judges, they go out of their way. And we have some very big decisions coming up. Like immunity, is an example. A President of the United States has to have immunity because if you don’t have immunity, every president that leaves office \n",
      "… will be indicted by the sitting president of an opposing party. When I say every, most of them. Okay? Most of them, they’ll say, “Oh,” like in the case of Obama, he sends missiles in, he kills a lot of civilians. Or the case of Biden, the wall, not building it. For him not to have finished those open areas, for him to allow people to come into our country, for him to allow crime like we’ve allowed, for him to do the things that he’s done he’s been such a horrible president.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So that would mean you have to have immunity, otherwise, a president is not going to be able to function. They’re going to say, “Well, wait a minute. I don’t want to get indicted as soon as I leave.” And you’ll make some decisions that aren’t going to be great decisions. But if you don’t have immunity, you’re not going to be able to function as a president. \n",
      "Yes. \n",
      "I love that question. It’s such an important… Drain the swamp, I said that I never loved the term, but it really caught on somehow \n",
      "… and we did. When I fired Comey, that was a wonderful day and we fired a lot of different people. I didn’t say I made it easier myself. But you talk about the polls. So Nikki Haley early on had a good poll. It was a fake poll, but she had a good poll where she was up on Biden, but she hasn’t had that since. She’s getting killed by Biden. She’s losing everywhere to Biden. And they used the one poll that was very early, that was absolutely ridiculous, and I’m beating him in every poll. Every single poll now I’m beating him by a lot. And she’s going to lose. She’s not going to be able to beat Biden.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "It’s not Biden. People say, “He can’t walk off a stage. He can’t find the stairs.” If a stair is right there when you’re finished with your speech, he’s looking all over. He is trying to find the stair and they have to send people up to take him. But the whole thing is crazy. I personally, I don’t really think he’s going to run, but let’s see what happens. I think they’re going to stop him. I don’t believe they’re going to let him, but if he does, that’s fine. Whoever it may be, we just have to win because their ideology is so bad. \n",
      "But how do you do that? A friend of mine said, “You’re up 11 on Biden. How come?” And he’s not a political person, but a very smart person. Big businessman. He called me up, he said, “How can you only be winning by 11?” Well, 11’s a lot in the world of politics. But you have to understand they have the unions. But I think we’ve broken into the unions now. I think we’re going to have the unions, other than the top people. We may even have some of the top people, as you probably just saw. But they have the unions and they have civil service, but we treat civil service too.\n",

      "They have tremendous welfare votes, and they have the welfare vote. And they have a base of about 38, 39%. It was interesting because let’s say they have 39%, we have to do it the old-fashioned way. We have to run the East Coast. We have to run all sorts of places like Iowa. We have to run everything and we have to win like we did in 2016. We did much better in 2020 getting millions. I mean, we got millions more votes than we did in 2016. We did actually much better.\n",

      "People say, “Oh, well, I don’t know how’s that?” But most people understand what happened, okay? Most people understand what happened. We did so much better in 2020. Look, 2016 was unique and it was a big surprise to a lot of people except for the people that went to rallies and all. It’s interesting. We’d have a rally, 2020 also, we’d have a rally and we’d have 35, 40,000 people show up on one day notice, right? \n",

I’d like to find the person. I’m into the world of construction and things and they did a beautiful job. They had to use the fake news media to fill them up. So they have people from CNN standing in a circle, and then they’d say, “Oh, Trump didn’t win Arizona.”\n",

So we’re leading by a lot in all the polls, and you have to get out because we have to send a message, most importantly for November, because we have to beat this guy. If you say, “Gee, we’re leading by a lot, but let’s not get in,” especially with weather like this you just have to get out. A friend of mine said, “They’re hardy people in Iowa,” and they are hard.

      "That’s right. \n",
      "It’s very important to me because Iowa, I think of two things. I think of farmers, but you have a lot of other business. But I think of farmers and I think of politics.

He’ll lose you 28 billion.” That was one of the greatest deals I made, but I don’t talk about it. It was with China because of Covid. I don’t even talk about it.

We win Virginia, we win it a hundred percent. It’s over. The election would be over, so let’s do it right? Let’s do it. We’re going to be here. We’ve always done well here. But I’m with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That’s what you are. That’s what we all are. That’s what we are. Over the past week, we’ve been sort of in a rocket. We’ve been launching like a rocket to the Republican nomination. We just got numbers today that were unbelievable, but we won Iowa in a record, New Hampshire in a record.\n",

The Virgin Islands, we took that one in our record. We got our record so far. Let’s keep it going. And one week ago we won South Carolina, beating the ex-governor by an unprecedented number and getting double the number of votes of any previous candidate in history. South Carolina. We love South Carolina. And as you know today we have two contests, Missouri and the remainder of Michigan. We won Michigan by a lot, but that was about a third, but today it looks like we’re winning close to 100% of both Missouri and Michigan. Adding on to the last two total.

Many, many people that are not supposed to be in our country. So unfair to people that are on line for 10 years. They study, they work, they do everything, and then they see millions of people come in with no recourse, no nothing, no retribution. Yet crooked Joe is fighting the state of Texas to stop them from defending our border. They’re doing a job for the country. They’re actually cutting the wire fences open to let thousands of migrants come pouring in, the migrants that they have no idea. They’re from parts unknown. You know what that means? Parts unknown.

We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. ” Please, please, please help us,” Joe Biden says, yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production while at the same time substantially increasing the price.

We are a nation whose leaders are demanding all electric cars despite the fact that they don’t go far, cost too much, and whose batteries are produced in China with materials only available in China when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively in the United States but not available in China. And now we are a nation that wants to make our revered and very powerful army tanks the best in the world all electric, so that despite the fact that they are also not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way.\n",

      "And they also want to make our brand new beautiful jet fighters with a green stamp of energy savings though losing 15% efficiency, but allowing us to keep our enemy’s atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels never seen before. Who are these stupid people? Who are these fools that would do that to our country? Who are these people who would ruin our country? We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the United States just as the price of oil reached an all-time high. What other country would do such a foolish and self-destructive thing? Can we be energy independent and even dominant again? “Yes, oh, yes,” says President Trump. We will soon be dominant again. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan, leaving dead soldiers, American citizens, and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind. And also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world, cost us billions of dollars many years ago. And it’s only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. And now China occupies Bagram. Congratulations.\n",

      "And we are a nation that allowed Russia and Ukraine to fight, killing hundreds of thousands of people and it will only get worse under this administration. It would never have happened with me as your president. And for four straight years it didn’t happen. Nor did it come close. Likewise, the horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn’t even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office. Would not have happened. Iran was broke under the Trump administration. They didn’t have the money to fund Hamas or Hezbollah and all of the other instruments of terror that they had been funding for years.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But those sanctions were lifted by the corrupt Biden administration. And now Iran is a rich country with $221 billion and another six billion for hostages that we paid and $10 billion for electricity to Iraq, all complements of the incompetent Biden administration. And China with Taiwan is next. We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things. There is no punishment. But when people who love our country protest on January 6th in Washington, they become hostages of our country, unfairly imprisoned for very long periods of time. We are a Third World nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against the opposing political party like never, ever before. We’ve got a Federal Bureau of Investigation that won’t allow bad election-changing facts to be presented to the public and which offers $1 million to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump to lie and say it was fact where Hunter Biden’s laptop from hell was Russian disinformation and the FBI knew it wasn’t.\n",

      "But 51 intelligence agents said it was and a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country, who is cognitively impaired, in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry that no one even wants to think about. We are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press. Fake news is all you get and they are indeed the enemy of the people. They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J. Trump who has done nothing wrong except win an election that he wasn’t supposed to win.\n",

      "We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed, where crime is rampant and out of control like never before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions and trillions of dollars that has taken from the United States of America to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia, and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They weren’t going to do a thing against us and everyone knows it. And now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the world and perhaps most importantly, we are a nation that is no longer admired, respected, or listened to on the world stage. We are a nation that in many ways has become a joke and we are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, faith, and even to God.\n",

We are a nation that just sold a once great company, United States Steel, to Japan. We are a nation whose stock market’s continued success is contingent on MAGA winning the next election. The market goes up when we go up. When my polls go up, the market goes up. We are a nation where large packs of sadistic criminals and thieves are allowed to go into stores and openly rob them, beat up and kill their workers and customers, and leave with armloads of goods but with no retribution, where the authority of our great police has been taken, where their families and pensions have been threatened and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words law enforcement. We are a nation where fentanyl and other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug-infested crime-ridden nation, which is incapable of solving even the simplest of problems.\n",

Mothers will never again be forced to watch their children overdosing and hopelessly dying in their arms screaming, “What can I do? What can I do? My child is dead. What can I do?” We are a nation whose once-revered airports are a dirty, crowded mess. You sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won’t leave and they have no idea when they will, where ticket prices have tripled. They don’t have the pilots to fly the planes. They don’t seek qualified air traffic controllers. And frankly, they just don’t know what the hell they’re doing.\n",

We will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the communists, Marxists, and fascists, and we will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will rout the fake news media, we will drain the swamp, and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all. And like those incredible patriots before us, we will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield, we will never give in, we will never give up and we will never, ever, ever, ever back down. With your support, we will go on to victory the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House and we will take back our country on November 5th, 2024. The great silent majority is rising like never before. And under our leadership, the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer. You will be forgotten no longer. We are one movement, the greatest movement in the history of our country. One people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again.

      "Inhalt: Donald J. Trump (00:18):\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he says endorse, we’re really talking about 2015. He endorsed me before, actually long before I knew I was going to run. I said, “Who’s this man in Iowa? He’s a senator, a state senator. He is a good-looking guy too, doesn’t he look…” You could pay him and give him a lot of money. And by the way, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for being here. You are so great. Comes all the way from Missouri, which isn’t that far. You can’t drive an electric car that far though. Thank you very much. I appreciate it very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "(00:53)\n",
      "The group of people that we have on the stage is just emblematic of the tremendous group that we’ve had. We’ve had such a great team. We did well, we were looking really good in 2016. And just to go back to the senator, he was saying, I said, “Who is that guy? Brad, his name. Who is he? He keeps endorsing me. He keeps saying Trump, and I didn’t even know I was running.” He endorsed me four months before I knew I was running about four months before the Escalade ride down with our great first lady, and that was Brad. I said, “Who is he?” So he was the first one.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:28)\n",
      "But we have people that are so incredible. You’re Republican Party Chairman Bobby Kaufmann and his son, who is a brilliant guy and he worked with us. And I will tell you that is a family of real professionals. Matt Whitaker, who is the very talented and very good attorney general. Where is Matt? He’s around here someplace and he’s been with us all the way. We have a man that was very impressive and I say there’s nothing wrong with it. He’s so solid and so good that he didn’t catch on. Sometimes being a little controversial is good. He’s so perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:08)\n",
      "Although he did break his leg during the campaign, that wasn’t so good. But it sort of stood out a little bit, Doug. But Doug Burgum from North Dakota, the governor and his beautiful wife Kathryn. And he got out of the race. What people don’t know is that he actually supported me on the other side twice already, right? Then he decided to do it and he was outstanding. But the traction is never easy, right? You need controversy for traction sometimes. And this guy is the most solid guy. There’s no controversy whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:43)\n",
      "And he is one of the best governors in our country, and I hope that I’m going to be able to call on him to be a piece of the administration, a very important piece of the administration. And also just to conclude with this, the entire Trump team, and that includes my two boys who are really here all the time whenever we needed them. Whenever we needed them. They are great, Eric and Don. And look at all these people. Susie, I have to say. And Chris. Chris. And they want no accolades. They just want a victory and they want to make America great again.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:25)\n",
      "That’s all they want actually. They don’t want to be speaking. They don’t want to have pictures. They just want to do their job, right? I want to thank you very much, Jason, everybody. You’re really fantastic. What a job you’ve done. Thank you. So we’re going to come together. We are going to drill baby, drill, right away, drill baby, drill. We’re going to seal up the border because right now we have an invasion. We have an invasion of millions and millions of people that are coming into our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:59)\n",
      "I can’t imagine why they think that’s a good thing. It’s a very bad thing. I think it’s a group of people that probably larger in number than New York state. And we can’t have that. We can’t have that. It’s not sustainable as a country. It’s horrible. And they’re coming from prisons and jails. They’re coming from all over. They’re coming from countries that most people have never heard of. And they’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re being emptied out into our country. And they’re terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:31)\n",
      "Many terrorists are coming in. In 2019, I saw just recently on a poll, they had none in 2019, no terrorists. Now I even say there’s got to be some, but they have none. And then as soon as this group took over, they have hundreds and hundreds of terrorists coming in, known terrorists, some of them really bad. And many of them are in, and they came in and nobody knows where they are. This is not a good thing and we’re going to have to deport. We’re going to have to have a deportation level that we haven’t seen in this country for a long time since Dwight Eisenhower actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:11)\n",
      "So I don’t want to be overly rough on the president, but I have to say that he is the worst president that we’ve had in the history of our country. He’s destroying our country. And my wife attended the funeral two months ago of Rosalynn Carter and it was beautiful. And Jimmy Carter was there. And I thought to myself, “Jimmy Carter is happy now because he will go down as being a brilliant president by comparison to Joe Biden. He’ll be a brilliant president. He’s going to be known as brilliant by comparison.” So we have to stop the invasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:56)\n",
      "We have to bring down our energy. I say all the time, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation anywhere in the world. And we have to stop the crime and we have to help rebuild our cities and we have to rebuild the capitol, Washington DC. I was there when one of the Biden indictment trials. This is the only person, this never happened before, but I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they’re using that for election interference. And it’s on things like election. And I don’t know if you know, but they did polls tonight on the election of 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:33)\n",
      "Do you believe it was honest or not? 82% said it was not. And we can’t have that, Chairman. We can’t have that. You can’t have a situation like that. So we’re going to straighten out our elections. We’re going to do a lot of great things. We’re going to try and go to paper ballots as soon as possible. Voter ID, one day elections. We have these elections that last for 62 days. And if you need some more time, take as much time as you want. And so many bad things happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:07)\n",
      "We have to get rid of mail-in ballots because once you have mail-in ballots, you have crooked elections. Actually, Jimmy Carter’s commission said that a long time ago. We’re going to rescue our economy. We’re going to save our economy. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. There was never a greater economy, and now we don’t. And when you look at what’s happened with inflation, inflation is destroying… They call it a country killer going back hundreds of years. Germany… Countries that had big inflation are dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:39)\n",
      "They become dead countries. We have to stop that immediately and we want peace through strength. Russia would’ve never attacked Ukraine, would’ve never done it. Putin and I get along fine. We get along very well. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing. The fake news, which I would… If the fake news would become real and honest news, 90% of our problems in this country would be solved. They would be solved. So Russia would’ve never attacked. Israel would’ve never been attacked. The Ukraine situation is so horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:20)\n",
      "The Israeli situation is so horrible. What’s happened? And we’re going to get them solved. We’re going to get them solved very fast. I actually said, “Ukraine, I know President Putin very well. I know Zelenskyy very well. I’m going to get him and we’re going to get it solved very quickly.” Should have never happened, would’ve never happened. Now you have all that death, far greater than people understand. The numbers are far, far greater than anybody would even think possible. You’re going to find that out in the years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:49)\n",
      "When they knocked down these massive buildings in Ukraine and then you see they announced two people were slightly wounded. No, no many people were killed. Many people were killed. We’re going to get it stopped. But it’s so sad because it should have never started, people killed and a culture destroyed. You can never replace thousand year old buildings with the most beautiful golden domes and churches and everything, just all rubble now. And it’s so sad, would’ve never, ever happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:19)\n",
      "And likewise, Israel would’ve never been attacked. It all comes from Iran. And we would’ve had a deal with Iran very quickly, had the election where we, by the way, got… And I say we because it’s all we. We got more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country. But they say we lost by a whisker. But regardless of that, we’re going to do incredible things and we’re not going to let China do what they’d like to do. I get along great with him also, President Xi. He’s a very strong leader, and we’re going to get things solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:59)\n",
      "We’re going to get the Ukraine war solved. We’re going to get the Israeli situation solved. But if you think back to that, Iran was broke. I said to every country, anybody does business with Iran, buys oil from Iran. They were broke. We’re not going to let you do business in the United States. And that’s the way it is. They did very little business, almost sold no oil. Nobody wanted to do that. That’s a big penalty. And what happened is they had no money to give to Hamas and to give to Hezbollah. And in fact, there were a lot of stories at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:36)\n",
      "They had no money for terror. And for four years, we had no terror. We had the terror ban, we had the terror ban. They called it the Trump travel ban. But it was really the Trump terror ban. We don’t want people in our country that are going to blow up our shopping centers. Thank you very much. And we want a country of law and order. So we’re going to rebuild the capital of our country, Washington DC. We’re going to scrub those beautiful marble columns and get the [inaudible 00:11:07] stickers off them. And we’re going to scrub them and get the graffiti off them.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:11)\n",
      "And we’re going to clean the streets and we’re going to rebuild the streets. And we’re not going to have rusted medians through the middle that are falling down into the roads where foreign dignitaries from all over the world come and they look. And we’re not going to be riding on top of garbage like I did just a month ago, riding on top of garbage. We’re going to rebuild our beautiful Washington DC and we’re going to take control of it. And we’re going to make unbelievably harsh penalties for people that go around shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:41)\n",
      "Last week they shot three people. And every night something happens. It’s so sad. And likewise, we’re going to rebuild our cities and we’ll work with the Democrats to do it. I’d be glad to work with the people in New York. We’re going to work with the people in Chicago and LA. We’re going to rebuild our cities and we’re going to make them safe. And we’re going to give our police officers immunity. So every time they do something, they don’t get sued and stopped. We’re going to end crime in our cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:14)\n",
      "In Iowa, you don’t know what that means, but I’ll tell you, this is a different place. You don’t know about crime. You don’t know about getting mugged and getting whacked and getting thrown into subways. And we’re going to stop it, and we’re going to come down very hard on criminals and we’re going to stop crime in America. So I want to just finish by saying that this has been an incredible experience. The people have been… This is the third time we’ve won, but this is the biggest one.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:47)\n",
      "They said, “Well, if you win by 12%, that’s a big win. That’s going to be very hard to do.” Well, I think we’ve more than doubled that, I guess, tripled it maybe. They said you’ll never get over 50. And I just left and we were at 54. Now, I don’t know what’s going to happen with it, but they said, “You can’t do that, sir.” I said, “What’s about the highest?” “Well, you could get into the forties, maybe 40, 41.” And then I look up and it was very interesting. I didn’t know they called it early. I thought that they called it at about 10 o’clock. My impression. See, this gentleman, we built…\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:19)\n",
      "He’s dressed like a wall. I love this guy. He’s been at 150 rallies probably, right? He has the most beautiful outfit I’ve ever seen. It’s all beautiful brick. Will you come up here? Just come up here. Come on. It’s so nice to see, right? Come on up here. He’s emblematic of what we did. We built over 500 miles of wall. We were going to add another 200 miles. It’s much more than we promised. And we had the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have the worst border in the history of the world. Look at this, man.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you. I love that outfit. I love him. That’s great. We love it. That’s a hot selling jacket, by the way. But that represents what we did. No, we built a tremendous… That’s the reason. And we got Mexico to give us 28,000 soldiers free. And we had remained in Mexico and we had catch and release in Mexico, and we did a job. We had the safest border in our history. We had the greatest economy in our history. We were a great nation three years ago. And now we’re a nation in decline. We are going to turn it around so fast. It’s going to happen so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:42)\n",
      "We’re going to drill. We’re going to make great. We have great wealth. We’re going to drill. We’re going to use that money to lower your taxes even further. We gave you the biggest tax cut in history, and we’re going to lower them further. And we’re also going to pay off national debt. It’s about time. It’s about time. So it’s now off to New Hampshire, a great place. We won it last time and we won it both times and we love it. The people are great. But the truth is, the people in our country are great.\n",

      "They’re all great. We love Iowa, but they’re all great. They only want to see one thing. They want our country to come back. They’re embarrassed by what’s going on. Our country is laughed at all over the world. They’re laughing at us, and they want our country to come back. They want America. They want us to be great again.

You’re really fantastic. What a job you’ve done. Thank you. So we’re going to come together. We are going to drill baby, drill, right away, drill baby, drill.

We can’t have that. It’s not sustainable as a country. It’s horrible. And they’re coming from prisons and jails. They’re coming from all over. They’re coming from countries that most people have never heard of. And they’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They’re being emptied out into our country.

And many of them are in, and they came in and nobody knows where they are. This is not a good thing and we’re going to have to deport.

And I thought to myself, “Jimmy Carter is happy now because he will go down as being a brilliant president by comparison to Joe Biden. He’ll be a brilliant president.

This is the only person, this never happened before, but I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they’re using that for election interference. And it’s on things like election.

They did very little business, almost sold no oil. Nobody wanted to do that. That’s a big penalty. And what happened is they had no money to give to Hamas and to give to Hezbollah. And in fact, there were a lot of stories at the time.\n",

Now, I don’t know what’s going to happen with it, but they said, “You can’t do that, sir.” I said, “What’s about the highest?” “Well, you could get into the forties, maybe 40, 41.” And then I look up and it was very interesting.

Thank you very much, and I’m thrilled to be back in this beautiful state, we love this state, with thousands of hardworking God-fearing American patriots. And thanks to proud citizens like you, last month we won Iowa by the largest margin in GOP history. We then went to a beautiful place, New Hampshire, with more votes. We won it with more votes than any candidate has ever gotten in the history of the New Hampshire primary. That’s good. As you probably heard, two days ago, we won everything in the Virgin Islands. A nice place, beautiful place. Would you like to go sometime? We’ll all go together.\n",

We even won the primary that we didn’t participate in. We won the primary by 48 points and we didn’t participate in it. It was very nice. I think I was known as not this name. No, we won the primary by a lot. We didn’t have much competition, to be honest with you.\n",

So, so far we’re breaking every record, and I have a feeling we’re going to do that again, right, Henry, in South Carolina? We’re going to do it again. I think so. We don’t have much competition, I will tell you. Turned out we have a lot less competition than we thought. 14 days from now, each and every one of you is going to get out and vote and deliver a gigantic win right here in South Carolina. And this November we’re going to win the White House and we’re going to take back our country. We’re going to take it back. Terrible, terrible what’s been happening.\n",

We want to send a signal because we have to take back. They are destroying our country. This man is destroying our country. So on Monday, go vote. Early voting, go vote. Let’s not forget that this week we also had another massive victory that every conservative should celebrate. We crushed Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous Open Borders Bill. Crushed it. Mike Johnson did a very good job and the whole group did a great job in Congress. We crushed it. We saved America from yet another horrific Biden betrayal.

The fake news, every time I say it, anytime I want to have a little fun… Governor, we have fun sometimes even though the country’s going to hell, we have to have a little bit of fun, but every time I interchange Barack Hussein Obama… Remember Rush Limbaugh? He’d go, “Barack Hussein Obama.” I wonder what he was getting at. But every time I do interchanging, we do a little interchanging, they say, “He doesn’t know who the president is. He thinks it’s Barack Obama.” I say, “No, no.”\n",

I do the imitation where Biden can’t find his way off the stage, right? He can’t find the stairs.

So what I do, you have to be very careful with sarcasm and having a lot of fun because they don’t like fun. They use it to your disadvantage. But I will say that I’ve never seen such spirit as we have right now. Never. You look outside.

We got to get everybody in. But among other travesty, Biden’s horrendous border plan would have allowed millions and millions… This is the worst border plan I’ve ever seen. You don’t need a bill or a plan. All you have to do as president is say, “Shut the border,” like I did. I said, “Shut the border.” You don’t need bills and plans.\n",

Sadly, I don’t want to say this to the women, I don’t want to insult the women, but there are very few women coming in. They’re almost all men, 18 to 25. That means fighting age. That’s fighting age. So they have something planned and we’re not going to stand for it. They are destroying our country, this group of fascists. They’re destroying our country. They talk about democracy.

It’s hard to say it’s good to be indicted, but it sure as hell has helped the polls, hasn’t it? Because I’ve never had polls like that. No, he’s bad for democracy. And it would have given him new authority. The bill would’ve given him new authority to grant mass asylum, which, by the way, Birdbrain loves mass asylum. There’s nothing nice about her. There’s not. “I will never run against President Trump. He is a great president, the greatest president in my lifetime,” which is actually quite a bit now. “The greatest president in my lifetime,” she said, “I will never run against him.” Then she comes over to see me at Mar-a-Lago. “Sir, I will never run against you.” She brought her husband.

And I’ll tell you what, she did a job. She was fine. She was okay, but I didn’t put her there because I wanted her there at the United Nations. That wasn’t up to me.

And him, he and Peggy, at 6:00 in the morning, I said, “Who the hell is the guy…” I said, “That guy is campaigning like hell,” your lieutenant governor.

I have to say that otherwise the fake news would say, “Oh, he was very threatening.” Remember when Biden used to say, “Well, I’d like to take him behind the barn and punch him”?

You have to understand you don’t pay your bills, you get no protection.” It’s very simple. Hundreds of billions of dollars came into NATO, and that’s why they have money today because of what I did. And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything.

And you couldn’t because the civil service laws, you couldn’t do anything about it. They would steal. In Arizona, we had somebody stole $400,000 and they couldn’t fire the person. They caught them stealing $400,000 and you couldn’t fire them because of the laws. But we got accountability done and we got something that was even better. VA Choice. We had choice. If you couldn’t see your doctor within 24 hours, you go to a private doctor outside, we pay the bill. We saved thousands of lives. Thousands and thousands of lives. And we had the most… Thank you. No, it so great. It’s interesting, when I did that, I came up with that idea at a meeting. I had a meeting with a lot of generals, and they were saying how bad it was in the Veterans Administration because people would have to wait three, four, five months to see a doctor. You’re pointing, right? Three, four, five months. Sometimes they’d never get to see a doctor. And I said, “I have an idea. If you don’t see a doctor within the first few days, you go out and you get a private doctor.” I thought I was so brilliant. I said, “This is a great idea.” They’ve had that idea for 50 years. They couldn’t get it passed, right, Mike? They couldn’t get it passed. But we got it passed with the help of those people right there and plenty of others. Russell helped in a little bit later stage. Russell is so great.\n",

      "But we got it passed. And now they are seeing the doctor. If they don’t have and sometimes… The doctors are great, but they’re just loaded. And what happens is we send those people out. We have deals worked out with many doctors all over, and they come back and we’re saving thousands of lives by doing that. I mean, some people go in, they’re not very sick. And after waiting for four or five months without seeing a doctor, they become terminally ill for something that could have been done with a simple procedure, even a simple pill. They become terminally ill waiting. That’s happened many, many times, thousands of times. And I’m very proud of Right-to-Try because everyone said you couldn’t get it approved. It would almost be impossible. I had to go through Congress. So we appreciate the congressman and David, your help too. We appreciate the people in the room.

We had catch and release, but it was in Mexico. We released them in Mexico. We built tremendous, hundreds of miles of the wall. We got Mexico to give us free of charge 28,000 soldiers right on our border, and we created the strongest border that we’ve ever had. We got rid of so many things. And for medical reasons, if you were sick, you couldn’t come into our country, you know all about that. We had a lot of things. They’ve given it all up.

So this is a little takeoff on a very successful song from many, many years ago, and it was redone a little bit to make it more pertinent, but I think it is because we have people coming into our country who shouldn’t be here.

Take me in, oh, tender woman,’ cried the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk.

Take me in, oh, tender woman,’ cried the vicious snake. ‘I saved you,’ cried the woman, ‘and you’ve bitten me but why?

And we say, “We want our money.” Because we give money, and then they go to another side. As an example, let’s say we give all this money. We’re already into Ukraine for over $200 billion. And they could make a deal with Russia in the next three weeks, and all of a sudden they don’t want to deal with us anymore. We’ve given hundreds of billions of dollars. And why are we at over $200 billion and the European nations are, if you add them up, it’s a very similar-sized economy, they’re at $25 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So we’re at 200 plus, and it affects them much more. We have a thing called an ocean between us, affects them much more. But we’re at 200, they’re at 250. I did the same thing with NATO. I got them to pay up. NATO was busted until I came along. I said, “Everybody’s going to pay.” They said, “Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?” I said, “Absolutely not.” They couldn’t believe the answer. And you never saw more money pour in to Secretary General Stoltenberg. I don’t know if he is anymore, but he was my biggest fan. He said, “All these presidents came in, they’d make a speech, they’d leave. And that was it.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And they all owed money, and they wouldn’t pay it. I came in, I made a speech, and I said, “You got to pay out.” They asked me that question. One of the presidents of a big country stood up, said, “Well, sir, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?” I said, “You didn’t pay. You’re delinquent?” He said, “Yes, let’s say that happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "“No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.” And the money came flowing in. And Henry would know this. If I said, “Yes, I will. You don’t have to pay. Yes, I will.” Most politicians have said to that, “Yes, we will protect you under any circumstances.” Well, then they’re never paying up. I said, “No, no. You have to understand you don’t pay your bills, you get no protection.” It’s very simple. Hundreds of billions of dollars came into NATO, and that’s why they have money today because of what I did. And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn’t ask for anything. We were like the stupid country of the world, and we’re not going to be the stupid country of the world any longer. We’re not going to be.\n",

      "It got bad under this guy. So he now wants to send them 50, 60 billion dollars. I have to say one thing, I think the greatest salesman ever in history is Zelensky. And I like Zelensky, because during the hoax, the impeachment hoax, they said I made a threatening phone call to him. And when they asked him, he said, “No, it wasn’t threatening. It was a very nice call.” He could have played to the bandwagon. He didn’t do that. He told the truth, so I like Zelensky. But that war’s got to end. We can make a deal on that war. One of the things we’re going to do is we’re going to get that war ended. That war is a disaster. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are being killed, far more than you’re reading about. And you notice you don’t hear about that war anymore. You know why? Because they’re not doing well, that’s why. Because the fake news is totally bought in, and now they’re saying, “This is not working out.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "No, we got to get that war settled, and I’ll get it settled. It would’ve never happened with Putin. It would’ve never happened. And by the way, it didn’t happen for four years. It didn’t happen. We’ll get it settled. But we’re fighting for the people of our country. We’re going to stop that war. We’re going to stop other wars that are happening. When you think of what took place in Israel just a short while ago, would’ve never happened. Even the Democrats were on television the other day, defaced the nation. Did you ever watch the show Deface? Ladies and gentlemen, it’s Donald Trump on Deface the Nation. No, I think it was deface the nation, they’re all the same. All very radical and crazy. But they were saying that no one thing I will admit, if Trump were president, you wouldn’t have had Israel attacked, you wouldn’t have had Ukraine attacked, and you wouldn’t have had inflation.\n",

      "Other than that… but we’re going to drain the swamp. We started off, we fired Comey, that fraud. We got rid of that guy and we got rid of a lot of others. And then we had COVID came in. And we had the greatest economy in history, even for four years, the greatest economy. But just prior to COVID, we had to fix that. Nobody knew what it was. I get great credit for economy. I get great credit for the military. I get great credit for foreign policy. Viktor Orban, did you ever hear of him? Prime Minister of Hungary, great guy. He was interviewed recently, and he said… They said, “What’s going on? The whole world is blowing up.” He said, “I have a simple solution. Let the United States of America elect quickly Donald Trump, it will all end very fast. You’re not going to have any more problems.” He said, “You’re not going to have any problems.”\n",

      "He’s one of the toughest guys. A smart guy, great guy, loves his country. But he said, and I don’t use this term, but he used this term, “China was afraid of Donald Trump. Russia was afraid.” Remember when I stopped their pipeline, Nord Stream 2? I stopped it. I said, “It’s over. We’re not going to do it. You’re not going to have a pipeline going all through Europe.” And I stopped it, and it was done. And Biden came in, he approved it. Like, so crazy. We were going to be selling because we were going to drill, baby drill. And we were going to be selling oil and natural gas and everything else to Europe and all over the world, but these foolish people, these stupid, stupid people, what they’ve allowed to happen to our country. And the reason, the reason that we’re all doing so well, and you’re respected too, by the way, make America, MAGA is very respected now.\n",

      "You see Jamie Dimon, the head of one of the great banks, one of the big banks. The other day, he was saying, “Well, no, we have to respect MAGA. We have to respect.” You better believe they have to respect MAGA, and MAGA, I think is 90% of the Republican. They like to say, “Well, Trump has a solid 35% of…” No, no, no, it’s not 35. We have 90, 95. He’s lifting off. That’s a front row Joe, stand up, Joe. Front row Joe’s, look at these people. Whoa, whoa.\n",

They got a lot of cash. They got to have a lot of cash, they follow me all over the place. Thank you, thank you. Now, they’re great people actually. But as president, I ended the NAFTA disaster, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with a brand new USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada who are ripping us off. I know they’re our neighbors, but they were ripping us off. The best trade deal they say ever made in our country. I know it’s good because they want to renegotiate the deal. And for years we suffered with NAFTA, and everyone said, “You’re going to have get it knocked out in Congress, that one.” That couldn’t be executive order.\n",

      "And amazing, but it was a giant win for South Carolina and farmers, manufacturers. It was a tremendous win for Iowa. It was a tremendous win for Wisconsin, but it was a great win for you. I took on communist China like no administration in history, bringing in hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions. And I would say my relationship got to be a little bit sour. There are a lot of people think that COVID came because of that. They said, “How do we get this guy out?” Now what they’re trying to do is use the justice department, the local DAs and the attorney generals, but nothing’s going to work. Look, we’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job. If we do a great job and we have the people on our side, nothing they can do can hurt us. We’re doing something that’s never been done before. We’re straightening out a mess.\n",

      "Then I gave, out of China, I gave our farmers $28 billion right out of those tariffs that China was paying, right out of the tariffs from China. Manufacturers too. Remember the night I won the Iowa caucuses, the Chinese stock market took a tremendous nosedive. Some people would say a little bit of a mini crash. I won Iowa by the record that we talked about, and the market dropped. Then the next week, I won New Hampshire. The market went way down. The China market, what does that tell you? That tells you that you don’t have to say anything. And I’m not looking to hurt them, but they have to treat us fairly. We’re not looking to hurt China. We’ll have a good relationship with China, I hope. But they respected us. They didn’t want those tariffs. For the first year, they pretended like the tariffs didn’t bother them.\n",

      "I made it 25%, then I made it 35%. And they kept saying, “It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter. We don’t care about the tariffs, we’re China.” I said, “I can’t believe it. They don’t care. It’s a lot of money, but that’s okay.” Then I made it 45. Then I got a call from the top man, President Xi, who you have to respect . Can you imagine him dealing with Biden? Biden walks and he falls asleep. They said, “Get this guy out of here. He won’t know.” He won’t know where he was. But I got a call from the top guy, said, “Please stop the tariffs. You’re killing us.” I said, “Ah, okay.” But they’re great negotiators. They are great negotiators, much better than the people we have negotiating. We have these guys go over there begging. They’re like beggars. But they knew that crooked Joe and Nikki Haley are very good for China. They’re China people. They’re into China. Donald J. Trump is good for the United States of America. That’s what I’m good for. By the way, did you see the picture? I have hardly used this crazy teleprompter today. It’s terrible. We have enough time for this, right? Yes? Do we have enough time? David, should we give you club for growth? Club for growth? David, stand up please. He’s now with us 100%. He’s with us 100%. Thank you. Thank you. Good to have you, man. Now, did they show you the picture of Mitt Romney? He’s like Kryptonite. If you touch Mitt Romney, you go down. I had a certain senator, I won’t say which one. I endorsed him. He took a 44 point lead. And then Mitt Romney got involved with him, and he started saying, “He has the endorsement of Mitt Romney.” That’s a kill. He went from 44 point lead to a 10 point deficit, but I got involved because I knew it wasn’t true. And he won his state. It was a great victory. I don’t want to tell you the senator, a lot of people know. Could have been more than one senator.\n",

Oh, do we have good work? This was not on the screen. Congratulations people in the back. And Obama also, she actually dropped Romney for a little while for Obama. But this is where, one thing with a politician, Henry knows this better than anybody. When they come out with an idea, they change for elections. A certain person was running, and he was totally against a certain agricultural product. All of a sudden, just before the election, he came out and he said, “I love it, I love it, I love it.”\n",

They love to talk about democracy, but they’re the ones who are weaponizing the DOJ, the FBI, our election systems. Local DAs, I got DA’s.

      "Thank you [inaudible 00:02:23]. Wow. That is really something. This was a little sooner than we anticipated, it was an even bigger win than we anticipated, and I was just informed that we got double the number of votes that has ever been received in the great State of South Carolina. So that’s pretty good. So it’s a record times two.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:51)\n",
      "And there’s something going on in the country. Some really great things are going on. You look outside and you see all of the horror. You see millions and millions of people coming across the border illegally. We don’t know where they come from. They come from jails, they come from prisons, they come from all sorts of places that we don’t want to know, they come from mental institutions and insane asylums, and we don’t want that in our country. We’re not going to stand for it. You have terrorists coming in, you have people coming in that we just can’t … we can’t do this. No country could sustain what’s happening to the United States of America, no country.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:32)\n",
      "So we’re going to straighten things out. The border is the worst it’s ever been. In 2016, we won and we had a bad border, and I talked about the border a lot, talked about it a lot, and I said, “We’re going to fix it.” We fixed it very quickly, and in 2020, we couldn’t talk about it, although we did get millions of more votes a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:51)\n",
      "But now, there’s a spirit that I have never seen. We ran two great races, but there’s never been, ever, there’s never been a spirit like this. And I just want to say that I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now. Never been like this. And a big part of that is the people standing behind me. These are the biggest officials in South Carolina, but I say the biggest officials in our country, as far as I’m concerned. They’re state figures, but they’re national figures, and in the truest sense of the word, they love our country so much and they want to see our country succeed and be respected again. Right now, we’re a laughing stock all over the world. Our country is going to be respected again, respected like never before.\n",

      "So this is a fantastic evening. It’s an early evening and a fantastic. So you can all go down and you can celebrate for about 15 minutes, and we have to get back to work because the big date … Michigan’s coming up. We’re doing great. The auto workers are going to be with us 100% because they got sold out by this country, but Michigan’s up and we’re going to have a tremendous success there.

Because they stuck right from the beginning, from the very moment we announced, and they believe in Make America Great Again. That’s what they believe in. They believe in America First. We’re putting America first. First of all, my family, Melania, Barron, Don Jr. and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Tiffany and Michael, they’re so, so supportive, so supportive of me, and we really appreciate it and love them.

Get out. Get out, Joe. You’re fired.” They’re destroying our country and we’re going to … I just wish we could do it quicker. Nine months is a long time. I just wish we could do it quicker, Mr. Governor. Is there anything you can do with your vast powers to make that … In certain countries, you’re allowed to call your election date. If I had the right to do it, I’d do it tomorrow. I’d say, “We’re having an election tomorrow.” Henry, is there anything you can do?\n",

Is he good?” they said, “He’s really great.” “I said, “Well, I hope so.” And you know what? Within about two weeks, I said, “That guy is unbelievable.” I never got the support of the governor.

So I thought he was okay, but he didn’t love speaking about himself because he’s a good person. See, I have no problem with that [inaudible 00:08:45]. What a personality, I don’t know, but he endorsed me, and then we asked him to go and do a few shows, and they’re not often nice shows. They’re very hostile.

What a dynamo,” and he has been one of our great advocates. He’s been doing things that have been unbelievable, and I’m just very happy he didn’t have that same energy, drive because I think I probably would’ve been out of the race a long time ago, but I want to say a very special man.

So we love both of them. We love them both very much and we won them both very easily. And one of the reasons we won North Carolina is a man named Michael Whatley, who looks to me, we gave him our endorsement, and he looks to me like he’s going to be going on to the National Republican Party as the boss, Michael Whatley.

And then we’re leading all over the place, Georgia, and then boom, and we’re leading, but North Carolina, I said, “When is North Carolina … Where is that going to go?

So we have members of Congress with us. I’m very proud of this one because I said, “That guy would be great.” We had somebody that did a vote that I wasn’t exactly happy with. He voted to impeach your favorite president.\n",

Let’s see.” I said, “Who do we have that’s good?” And they said, “The best we have is a man named Russell Fry.” And Russell Fry got out there, beat him so badly in the primaries. He had my support and he’s been a fantastic congressman. So wherever you may be, hi, Russell, what a great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:17:43]. We got rid of that one. We got rid of a lot of them. Almost, I guess, every one of them, almost every one of them, now they’re gone. The impeachers are all gone.\n",

It’s about 60 women that travel all over the country with me. Every time I’m out, we do a rally. We have to do … at least it has to be up significant, so usually rallies, but I think they’re up to number 121. They’ve done [inaudible 00:20:11]. They’re all beautiful women. Obviously, they’re very wealthy. They look so wealthy and beautiful. Look at hem over here. But they travel all over the country, and way over 100, and I’m trying to figure out the husband. They’re all happily married. They have these wonderful husbands. One of the husbands is standing right there. He’s the smartest one of all.\n",

It’s just about over for the vote. Please.” She said, “Nope, nope. I’m staying longer.” This is the hardest working, wherever you are, the most incredible woman.

That’s like, who has the most home runs, who has the most hits in baseball, or who threw the most touchdowns in football, who got the most points in basketball. It’s a very simple, we got the most votes in the history of New Hampshire primary. That’s a tremendous … And that goes back so many decades and we beat him. You have John F.

And then they had a primary, and this is no candidate, [inaudible 00:23:41] this had various forms, unknown candidate, but this is no candidate, got 65% of the vote. And they think I was the no candidate because it was a caucus, it wasn’t a primary and you have to know what you’re doing.

They make it really easy, and many of them, as I was announcing, it seems like a long time ago, but as I was announcing, before I finished the speech, they said, “We’re endorsing Trump.” Those are friends. Those are great, great friends. And we had some strong competitors. We had some very strong competitors, but these were real friends. South Carolina, thank you very much, go home, get rest.

      "Thank you . Wow. That is really something. This was a little sooner than we anticipated, it was an even bigger win than we anticipated, and I was just informed that we got double the number of votes that has ever been received in the great State of South Carolina. So that’s pretty good. So it’s a record times two.\n",

      "And there’s something going on in the country. Some really great things are going on. You look outside and you see all of the horror. You see millions and millions of people coming across the border illegally. We don’t know where they come from. They come from jails, they come from prisons, they come from all sorts of places that we don’t want to know, they come from mental institutions and insane asylums, and we don’t want that in our country. We’re not going to stand for it. You have terrorists coming in, you have people coming in that we just can’t … we can’t do this. No country could sustain what’s happening to the United States of America, no country.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So we’re going to straighten things out. The border is the worst it’s ever been. In 2016, we won and we had a bad border, and I talked about the border a lot, talked about it a lot, and I said, “We’re going to fix it.” We fixed it very quickly, and in 2020, we couldn’t talk about it, although we did get millions of more votes a second time.\n",

      "But now, there’s a spirit that I have never seen. We ran two great races, but there’s never been, ever, there’s never been a spirit like this. And I just want to say that I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now. Never been like this. And a big part of that is the people standing behind me. These are the biggest officials in South Carolina, but I say the biggest officials in our country, as far as I’m concerned. They’re state figures, but they’re national figures, and in the truest sense of the word, they love our country so much and they want to see our country succeed and be respected again. Right now, we’re a laughing stock all over the world. Our country is going to be respected again, respected like never before.\n",

      "So this is a fantastic evening. It’s an early evening and a fantastic. So you can all go down and you can celebrate for about 15 minutes, and we have to get back to work because the big date … Michigan’s coming up. We’re doing great. The auto workers are going to be with us 100% because they got sold out by this country, but Michigan’s up and we’re going to have a tremendous success there. And then we have a thing called Super Tuesday, and I think we’re leading 91 to seven, overall.\n",

      "If you don’t mind, may I have the pleasure of introducing some incredible people? Because they stuck right from the beginning, from the very moment we announced, and they believe in Make America Great Again. That’s what they believe in. They believe in America First. We’re putting America first. First of all, my family, Melania, Barron, Don Jr. and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Tiffany and Michael, they’re so, so supportive, so supportive of me, and we really appreciate it and love them. We have a great family and we have incredible friends.\n",

Get out. Get out, Joe. You’re fired.” They’re destroying our country and we’re going to … I just wish we could do it quicker. Nine months is a long time. I just wish we could do it quicker, Mr. Governor. Is there anything you can do with your vast powers to make that … In certain countries, you’re allowed to call your election date. If I had the right to do it, I’d do it tomorrow. I’d say, “We’re having an election tomorrow.” Henry, is there anything you can do?\n",

      "I want to start off because, right from the beginning, Henry McMaster, the governor of this incredible state, and much more importantly, his wife, Peggy, she’s with him all the way, I’ll tell you, never saw anything, what a couple, but I’d like to ask him to say a few words. He’s a very special man, an incredible governor, very popular in the state, and really, he gave us some very good advice, and he has right from the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "From the day I announced, I had the lieutenant governor, he was the lieutenant governor, and from right at the beginning, when I announced and I said, “I don’t know the gentleman. Is he good?” they said, “He’s really great.” “I said, “Well, I hope so.” And you know what? Within about two weeks, I said, “That guy is unbelievable.” I never got the support of the governor. She supported somebody else, but I had the support of somebody much, much better, Henry McMaster, and we won in a landslide. And I’d like to ask the governor to say a few words, please. Henry? \n",
      "So I’m going to ask somebody else  because he came on board, and Lindsey wanted him, and the lieutenant governor wanted him, and everybody wanted him, Henry and Peggy wanted him. So I thought he was okay, but he didn’t love speaking about himself because he’s a good person. See, I have no problem with that . What a personality, I don’t know, but he endorsed me, and then we asked him to go and do a few shows, and they’re not often nice shows. They’re very hostile. And what he did was, I said, “Is this the same man?” and he campaigned nicely, but he’s a high-quality person.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "When he was supporting me the day … Is that correct, Lindsey? When he went out, Tim Scott, Senator Tim Scott, he went out and he was ripping it, I said, “What happened to Tim Scott? What a dynamo,” and he has been one of our great advocates. He’s been doing things that have been unbelievable, and I’m just very happy he didn’t have that same energy, drive because I think I probably would’ve been out of the race a long time ago, but I want to say a very special man. I really do mean it. So many people have such great respect for him, and you’re very lucky to have him in the state. Tim, please, say a few words. \n",
      "Thank you very much, Tim. Really great job, amazing. Another man, not a lot of people know him, he doesn’t do too much television, he happens to be a little bit further left than some of the people on the stage, but I always say, when I’m in trouble on the left, I call up Lindsey Graham and he straightens it out so fast. And I’ll tell you … No, no, no, no. Remember. I love him. He’s a good man. Come up here, Lindsey. Come up here, Lindsey. Come here. \n",
      "Thank you, Lindsey. I have a son who’s a very talented guy, and he works so hard, and we love him, and his wife is very good. She goes on. Hi, Laura. And I want to thank Eric and Laura for doing such a fantastic job and really, really amazing. They’re amazing people. Let’s go down a little list of some of the people that are up here tonight because every one of them is a star in their own right. And your lieutenant governor is going places. You do know that, right? Pamela Evette, and really going places. And Speaker of the House, Murrell Smith, who’s coming up in a couple … Some of these people are actually busy. He’s running to get over here. But we want to thank you, Speaker of the House, fantastic person doing a great job for the state.\n",

We have a man who’s done a really good job in the state, your South Carolina GOP Chair, Drew McKissick. Thank you. We have a highly opinionated group of people. I’ll tell you, they’ve turned very positive on you very quickly, Lindsey. \n",
      "So you have a beautiful, beautiful state right next to you, North Carolina. We love North Carolina. In fact, they named their daughter Carolina and I said, “Which state?” She said, “Both.” I think I know which state, but that’s okay, but they have the most beautiful daughter named Carolina. So we love both of them. We love them both very much and we won them both very easily. And one of the reasons we won North Carolina is a man named Michael Whatley, who looks to me, we gave him our endorsement, and he looks to me like he’s going to be going on to the National Republican Party as the boss, Michael Whatley. Where is Michael? Michael, thank you very much. And he’s going to be working with Laura.\n",

      "And we may be putting Kellyanne in the group, too. Do we like Kellyanne? We love Kellyanne. But you’re going to do a fantastic job, both of you. We appreciate it very much. What a job he’s done in North Carolina. That evening of 2020 with those votes coming in, we’re leading in Pennsylvania, and all of a sudden, no, something happened. It went boom. And then we’re leading all over the place, Georgia, and then boom, and we’re leading, but North Carolina, I said, “When is North Carolina … Where is that going to go? When are they going to drop lots of ballots into that one?” And you know what he did? He just kept that thing and we never had a problem. And I said, “That’s my kind of guy.” He had hundreds of lawyers. How many lawyers did you have? \n",
      "He had 500 lawyers to make sure they didn’t cheat, and they didn’t cheat in North Carolina. And I said, “That’s my kind guy.” So I appreciate it. Great job. We’re very proud of you and you’re going to do a fantastic job. And come election, period … We used to have election night. Now we have election period because some of these elections go on for 48 days, 61 days. They get all this equipment, then they announce, “They’ll be announcing the vote in three weeks from now.” Can you imagine? They don’t know what they’re doing, but I will tell you, you have done a fantastic job and we very much appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Michael.\n",

Families all across America are struggling under the brutal weight of crooked Joe’s failures, disasters, heartless betrayals, and a thing called inflation, at a level like nobody’s ever seen before. While the stock market is making rich people richer. Thank you very much. Thank you. It is making rich people richer. Biden’s inflation catastrophe is demolishing your savings, ravaging your dreams. His sky-high energy prices are brutalizing your wallets. Our border has been erased. We have no border any longer. Criminals are running wild in our Democrat run cities, while Christians and conservatives are persecuted. And thanks to crooked Joe’s breathtaking weakness, the world is going up in flames. The world is laughing at us. They can’t blame. I tell you what. They can’t blame us. This is the USA. They’re not blaming us. They’re blaming him. He is a laughing stock all over the world.

Frankly, I didn’t realize it until well into the administration when you see all the things we did, we’re going to cover them; biggest tax increase in history. When we had had the biggest tax decrease ever. Ever. Think of it. Ever in history of our country. The biggest tax cut, the biggest tax decrease, in the history of our country.

Friends of mine that live here, you don’t even think of it, but friends of mine that live here, they’re under siege. They say they’re houses are being robbed. Their cars are being stolen. Who the hell thought of it? I never even thought it was here. I didn’t think you had the problem here. You have it all over the country.

Three years ago, we had the most secure border in US history. We built 561 miles of border wall. We got Mexico to give us, free of charge, 28,000 soldiers. Thank you very much.

Tom Homan. We had just unbelievable people. If they would’ve just left it alone, you were setting every record. They took everything we did. They didn’t finish the little sections of wall. We had built it. It was there. All they had to do is put it up. They actually sold those sections of wall for 5 cents on the dollar. Can you believe it? All they had to do is put it up.\n",

They’re catching record numbers of terrorists, but the ones that they don’t catch, those are the bigger problems because they’re coming in at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. This is a problem that our country’s going to have. We have to take care of it very quickly and local law enforcement will help and they’ll help a lot. And I want to thank them.

He hasn’t cried since he was about one month old. ” Sir, do you mind if I shake? We have to save our country. May I shake your hand, sir?” “Yes.” You go, “Aww.” But that’s okay. We do it.

They’re coming from Africa, from Asia all over but this happened to be in South America, and he was sitting reading a newspaper, sort of leisurely, and they were asking him, “What are you doing?” “I was very busy all my life. I was very proud. I worked 24 hours a day. I was so busy all the time. But now I’m in this mental institution,” where he’s been for years. “And I’m in the mental institution and I worked very hard on my patients, but now we don’t have any patients.

They come out of, they say in the back, “Oh, please sir, don’t mention the words, insane asylum.” But they come out of insane asylums, all over the world and mental institutions.

And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst President of the history of our country who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia at possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry involved, because of the power of the horrible, horrible weaponry.

      "They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J. Trump who has done nothing wrong except win an election. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control like never before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They were never going to do a thing to us and everyone knows it. Now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the rest of the world. And perhaps most importantly, we are a nation that is no longer admired, respected, or listened to on the world stage.

Where the authority of our great police has been taken, where their families and pensions have been threatened and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words law and order. We are a nation where fentanyl and all other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug infested, crime-ridden nation, which is incapable of solving the simplest of problems.

You sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won’t leave and they have no idea when they will, where the ticket prices have tripled. They don’t have the pilots to fly the planes. They don’t seek qualified air traffic controllers and they just don’t know what the hell they’re doing. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower, and strength. We are a nation that has lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again. It was hard-working patriots like you who built this country and it is hard-working patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state, we will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the communists, we will throw off the sick political glass. We will rout the fake news media. We will drain the swamp and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all. We will be liberated. Like those patriots before us, we will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never, ever back down. With your support, we will go on to victory, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House and we will take back our country on election day 2024. The great silent majority is rising like never before. And under our leadership, the forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer. We will love our country. We will take care of our country. We will pray to God for our strength and for our liberty. We will pray for God and we will pray with God. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again.

We are just seven weeks away from the Nevada presidential caucuses and on Thursday, February 8th, we are going to win the Nevada caucuses. We are then going to crush crooked Joe Biden. He is our crooked, horrible president. A horrible president. Next November, we’re going to win so big, it’s going to do something like you’ve never seen before.

While the stock market is making rich people richer. Thank you very much. Thank you. It is making rich people richer. Biden’s inflation catastrophe is demolishing your savings, ravaging your dreams. His sky-high energy prices are brutalizing your wallets. Our border has been erased. We have no border any longer. Criminals are running wild in our Democrat run cities, while Christians and conservatives are persecuted. And thanks to crooked Joe’s breathtaking weakness, the world is going up in flames. The world is laughing at us. They can’t blame. I tell you what. They can’t blame us. This is the USA. They’re not blaming us. They’re blaming him. He is a laughing stock all over the world.

Crooked Joe is a low IQ individual and he is truly the worst, most incompetent, and most corrupt president in the history of our country. In fact, Jimmy Carter is very happy because he looks like a brilliant… That was a brilliant administration by comparison to what you have right now. Very, very brilliant indeed.\n",

Not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden. Not one thing. Name one thing. Does anybody out there? Do you have any Biden fans? Are there any Biden fans in this big crowd? After three years of Bidenomics, he thinks the term is good. No, it’s a bad term, not a good term. You know the one he doesn’t like? MAGA. He talks about MAGA. It’s called Make America Great Again.

And then you have to ask, were you better off five years ago or are you better off today? You’re a lot better off five years ago, And you think what a difference a president makes? Makes a big difference. I had no idea, to the extent. Frankly, I didn’t realize it until well into the administration when you see all the things we did, we’re going to cover them; biggest tax increase in history. When we had had the biggest tax decrease ever. Ever. Think of it. Ever in history of our country. The biggest tax cut, the biggest tax decrease, in the history of our country. The biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. The best job numbers in the history of our country. The real job numbers, not the fake job numbers that they give.\n",

But you weren’t just better off financially under President Trump, you’re also much, much safer when President Trump was in the White House. I mean, how unsafe is it? Friends of mine that live here, you don’t even think of it, but friends of mine that live here, they’re under siege. They say they’re houses are being robbed. Their cars are being stolen. Who the hell thought of it? I never even thought it was here. I didn’t think you had the problem here. You have it all over the country. The lawlessness is unbelievable but we are going to give law enforcement back their authority. We’re going to give it back. They have to have it back.\n",

      "Under our leadership you were safer, your family was safer, your communities were safer, your children were safer, your borders were safer, and your whole country was safer, a lot safer. Three years ago, we had the most secure border in US history. We built 561 miles of border wall. We got Mexico to give us, free of charge, 28,000 soldiers. Thank you very much. We ended catch and release. We let our great ICE agents do their job and we deported over one million illegals in my very first term; one million, back to their country.\n",

      "Our border had never been stronger, but then crooked Joe came in and he launched an invasion against our country. This is an invasion. This is like a military invasion.

      " \n",
      "Under Biden, you have the highest number of illegal border crossings in the history of our country, by far the highest number of illegal visa overstays, and by far a new record being set every single week on drugs and every other lousy thing that’s coming into our country.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But as soon as we win the election, the momentum of our great victory will immediately begin stopping the hordes of illegal alien migrants who are charging across our border by the hundreds of thousands. Just like three years ago, the invasion will end. It ended with us. When we came in, it just ended. We had to do a lot of work, but it ended. We had great people. Brandon Judd, border patrol. Tom Homan. We had just unbelievable people. If they would’ve just left it alone, you were setting every record. They took everything we did. They didn’t finish the little sections of wall. We had built it. It was there. All they had to do is put it up. They actually sold those sections of wall for 5 cents on the dollar. Can you believe it? All they had to do is put it up.\n",

      " \n",
      "But people will know that I will catch them. We will catch them. We’ll catch them together. We’re going to send them back. We’re going to send them out of our country. Given the unprecedented millions of Biden illegal aliens who are invading our country, it is only common sense that when I’m reelected, we will begin. And we have no choice. The largest deportation operation in American history. We have no choice.\n",

      "Crooked Joe has left us, no choice. They’re coming in by the tens of… They’re coming in. I believe the number by the end of this administration will be at least 15 or 16 million people. They come from prisons. They come from mental institutions and insane asylums. Many are terrorists. They’re catching record numbers of terrorists, but the ones that they don’t catch, those are the bigger problems because they’re coming in at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. This is a problem that our country’s going to have. We have to take care of it very quickly and local law enforcement will help and they’ll help a lot. And I want to thank them. A lot of them are here.\n",

      "In fact, I shook so many hands of policemen and law enforcement. This hand. They tend to have very strong hands and when you shake hundreds of them, they have very, very powerful hands. “Sir, thank you very much.” “Thank you, sir.” One guy’s fingers, like sausages. “Sir, do you mind if I shake your hand?” “Absolutely.” And he’s crying a little bit because he’s happy. He hasn’t cried since he was about one month old. ” Sir, do you mind if I shake? We have to save our country. May I shake your hand, sir?” “Yes.” You go, “Aww.” But that’s okay. We do it. We do it for our country. And our country will pay a big price for this madness if we do not do what we have to do. We have to clean up our country. We have to get all the criminals. We have so many criminals being dumped into our country.\n",

      "I read an article recently, in a paper. It’s a fake newspaper, but I assume the article was true. Most of them are unfortunately. Look at it back there. But most of them are. And it was by a man and about a man who runs a mental institution in South America. And by the way, they’re coming from all over the world. They’re coming from Africa, from Asia all over but this happened to be in South America, and he was sitting reading a newspaper, sort of leisurely, and they were asking him, “What are you doing?” “I was very busy all my life. I was very proud. I worked 24 hours a day. I was so busy all the time. But now I’m in this mental institution,” where he’s been for years. “And I’m in the mental institution and I worked very hard on my patients, but now we don’t have any patients. They’ve all been brought to the United States.” This is what’s happening. This is what’s happening. And I read that. And you can multiply that by hundreds and even thousands of different places all over the world.\n",

Like they cheat, like hell. It’s the only thing they do good is, they cheat on elections. For the past three years, crooked Joe Biden and the ultra radical left democratic extremist in Congress, have turned America into a haven for blood-thirsty criminals, savage gang members like MS-13, very nice people. We’re sending them back, at levels that you’ve never.\n",

Our Vets aren’t treated good, but MS-13. And they send in dangerous inmates emptied out of the prisons. They come out of the prisons. They come out of, they say in the back, “Oh, please sir, don’t mention the words, insane asylum.” But they come out of insane asylums, all over the world and mental institutions. Insane asylum is a mental institution on steroids. That’s Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter. You ever hear of him? Silence of the Lip. That’s what we got. We got him coming in and this is not good.

And it’s a metaphor as to what will happen in Reno, in Nevada, all over the place. It’s a metaphor. It’s a very accurate, an old song that we worked on a little bit, but a metaphor as to what’s happening with illegal immigration and I think you’ll understand it very quickly. You sure you want it?

Take me in, ‘O tender woman,” cried the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk.

Does that remind you of anything? Be ready. Be ready. Because what they’re allowing into our country is very, very bad. Very, very, very bad. And I think that’s about as accurate as you could get, put in an interesting forum, right? It’s a very interesting form. Are we glad we did that? Yes. It’s sad that we have to do it.

Not big compared to what some countries get stupidly, but we pay them 750 million. I said, “Please inform them that starting tomorrow morning they’re not getting any more foreign aid.” So about an hour after we informed them, I got a call from all three of them, but separate.

You wouldn’t take them back, right?” And they said, “No, that’s not my understanding, but we would be very happy to talk.” I said, “Here’s the story. If you don’t take them back, you’ll never see anything from the United States in terms of foreign aid. Nothing.” And all three of them, they didn’t even have to hang up the phone.

They’ll say, we love Trump, but we’re not going to vote for him. At 5:00 they say, he has a chance. We’ll vote.” I said, “Wow, that’s really sick, huh?” That’s what it is. That’s how bad they are that we won Wisconsin. They had us down 17 and we won Wisconsin, and then we did, frankly better the second time where we did better in most places the second time.

      "But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has the highest inflation in 50 years where banks are collapsing and interest rates are skyrocketing. Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy independent or energy dominant as we were just a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. “Please, please, please help us,” Joe Biden says, and yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will we no longer be drilling for oil in large areas in Alaska or elsewhere, anywhere in our states. We are a nation that is consumed by the radical left’s Green New Deal, yet everyone knows that the Green New Deal is fake. It is really the green new scam.\n",

And now we are a nation that wants to make our revered and very powerful army tanks the best in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact they are also not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory, at least in an environmentally friendly way. And they also want to make our jet fighters with a green stamp of energy savings through losing 15% efficiency. That’s all we’ll lose, sir. That’s all we’ll lose. But allowing us to keep our enemy’s atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels never seen before. Who are these people that would do this to us? Who are these people? It’s so sad. It’s so sad. It’s so sad.\n",

Can we be energy independent or even energy dominant ever again? Yes, oh yes. And quickly says President Trump. Yes, oh yes and quickly. We can. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan leaving dead soldiers, American citizens and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind. And also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world and only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. One hour away where weapons of mass destruction are being produced. And we left it, one of the biggest in the world. And we are a nation that allowed Russia and Ukraine to fight killing hundreds of thousands of people and it will only get worse. It would never have happened with me as your president.\n",

      "And for four straight years it didn’t happen. Likewise, the horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn’t even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was in the Oval Office. They would not have even thought about it. Iran was broke under President Trump. They didn’t have the money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and all of the other instruments of terror that they can now fund very easily. But those sanctions were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration and now Iran as a rich country with $200 billion and another 6 billion for hostages and $10 billion for electricity to Iraq all compliments of the incompetent Biden administration. And China with Taiwan is next. We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things. There is no punishment. But when people who love our country protest in Washington, they become hostages and prisoners unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time.

And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst President of the history of our country who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia at possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry involved, because of the power of the horrible, horrible weaponry.

We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us. They were never going to do a thing to us and everyone knows it. Now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the rest of the world. And perhaps most importantly, we are a nation that is no longer admired, respected, or listened to on the world stage.

Where the authority of our great police has been taken, where their families and pensions have been threatened and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words law and order. We are a nation where fentanyl and all other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug infested, crime-ridden nation, which is incapable of solving the simplest of problems.

They don’t seek qualified air traffic controllers and they just don’t know what the hell they’re doing. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, willpower, and strength.

With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state, we will drive out the globalists, we will cast out the communists, we will throw off the sick political glass. We will rout the fake news media. We will drain the swamp and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all. We will be liberated. Like those patriots before us, we will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never, ever back down. With your support, we will go on to victory, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We will evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House and we will take back our country on election day 2024. The great silent majority is rising like never before. And under our leadership, the forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer. We will love our country. We will take care of our country. We will pray to God for our strength and for our liberty. We will pray for God and we will pray with God. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again.

      "Well, I want to thank everybody. This is a fantastic state. This is a great, great state. We won New Hampshire three times now, and we win it every time. We win the primary, we win the generals. We’ve won it and it’s a very, very special place to me, it’s very important. If you remember in 2016, we came here and we needed that winner. We won by 21 points and it was great. And today, I have to tell you, it was very interesting because I said, “Wow, what a great victory.” But then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely when it was at seven, but now I just walked up and it’s at 14, but she ran up when it was seven and we have to do what’s good for our party. And she was up and I said, “Wow, she’s doing a speech like she won.” She didn’t win, she lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:14)\n",
      "And last week we had a little bit of a problem. And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, “Didn’t she come in third?” Yeah, she came in third. And then I looked at the polls. She was talking about most win ability, who’s going to win? And I had one put up, I don’t know if you see it, but I have one put up. We’ve won almost every single poll in the last three months against Crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll. And she doesn’t win those polls. And she doesn’t win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night, she had a very bad night.\n",

      "And you have the now very unpopular governor of this state, this guy, he’s got to be on something. I’ve never seen anybody with energy. He’s like a hopscotch. And I’m watching this guy and two weeks ago he said, “We’re going to win. We’re going to win in the left side. We’re going to win.” About three days ago he started he started saying, “Well, we want to do well,” that’s a big difference. But I walked out just now, we’re 14 points up and I don’t know what it’s going to be, but when she was up here, it was six or seven and with 7% of the vote counted. Now, let me just tell you, we had an unbelievable week last week and Iowa, we set a record.\n",

      "It was the best in the history of the caucus, and I remember I had the same feeling. I’m up and I’m watching and I said, “She’s taking a victory lap,” and we beat her so badly. But Ron beat her also. Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she’s still hanging around. The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes. I don’t know if you saw that. Tremendous numbers of Independents came out because in this state, because you have a governor that doesn’t frankly know what the hell he’s doing in this state, in the Republican primary, they accept Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats before October 6th. They already voted. Now, they’re already voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible because if you remember, we won in 2016, and if you really remember it, if you want to play it straight, we also won in 2020 by more, and we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.\n",

      "But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker. No, no, no. But we can’t let that happen. You have to have people that speak up. I said I can go up and I can say to everybody, “Oh, thank you for the victory, it’s wonderful.” Or I can go up and say, “Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and claimed a victory?” She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, “She’s going to win, she’s going to win, she’s going to win,” then she failed badly. Now, I have here if he promises to do it in a minute or less, but the only person more angry than let’s say me, but I don’t get too angry. I get even. The only person, because he was there and he did fantastically well by the way, then he endorsed me.\n",

But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek. I said, Vivek. I said, “Vivek, go up and say a few words about it.” He has to do it in one minute or less, and then we’re going to just say, “We had one hell of a night tonight.” And one other thing before Vivek comes. Do you see that poll? We’re going to put it up. We have beaten Biden. You could almost say, “Who can’t? Who the hell can’t?” The man can’t put two sentences together.

But you know who delivered a double-digit victory tonight? It is a double-digit victory as of right now is this man Donald J. Trump the leader of America First and that means something. Now, USA and Donald Trump, America First. Now, I’ve got 30 seconds left. I want to make this point here. We’ve got to say this right? What we see right now with her continuing in this race is the ugly underbelly of American politics where the mega donors are trying to do one thing when we, the people say another, and it’s up to us to we, the people to at long last say, “Hell, no. We, the people create a government that is accountable to us.”\n",

And the only thing they’re rooting for is an ugly thing that we don’t want to see happen. That’s what these people are rooting for, is playing to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet, we say no to that vision.

They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions, and it’s just killing our country. And I’m talking about millions and millions and millions. They are drug dealers, they’re everybody. And they come in just walking right through. There’s nobody to check and there’s nobody to vet, and we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is central casting, and I’d like you to say a few words about the border and who’s going to solve that problem and how quick are we going to do it, Tom. Go ahead, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Homan (08:54):\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan, and every president I ever worked for did something to secure the border, but no one did more than President Trump. The most secured border in my lifetime. The most secured border we’ve ever seen. And Donald Trump’s going to do it again. We’re going to lock the border down and we’re going to protect Americans because what’s happening at the border right now, a record number Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning, a record number migrants have died. A record number of women and children to sex traffic, a record number known suspected terrorists across the border. There’s one man who’s proven he can secure the border and he’s standing to my left, Donald J. Trump. He’s going to do it again.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you very much, Tom. So this is an evening that I will not forget because it’s the third time, but more importantly, I think it’s going to be the most important time. We won both, I think they said. Somebody said, “If you win both,” they’ve never had a loser. Let me put it that way, when you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they’ve never had a loss. There’s never been. So we’re not going to be the first, I can tell you. And I just do want to reiterate the polls, we’re way up on everybody. We’re way up on Biden. And over the last couple of months, if you check, and you have to remember in 2016, they were saying, “Oh, what does he know about elections? He’s not going to win. He can’t win. He can’t…” We won and we’ve got millions, and you can check this and I hope the cameras don’t turn off because they hate this, but we got millions and millions of more votes the second time, right, Mr. Congressman?\n",

      "(10:38)\n",
      "Millions and millions of more votes, but we had COVID and they use COVID to cheat and they did a lot of other things too. We’re not going to let that happen, and that’s still going along. You can never forget history because if you forget, you never recover from it and you repeat, and we’re not going to repeat. We’re going to have the greatest election success. We’re going to turn our country around. And if you take a look throughout the history of our country, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of this not great country right now, it’s a country in decline, it’s a troubled country, it’s a failing country frankly, but if you took the 10 worst presidents and put them together, the 10 worst, absolutely 10 worst. I used to say five.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:32)\n",
      "Remember I started, I’d say five, then I said, “Wait a minute, we can add another five.” They would not have done the damage that crooked Joe Biden has done to our wonderful country. They would not have done the damage. There’s never been anything like it. And you say, “Are they stupid people?” I don’t think so, because nobody can cheat that well if they’re stupid. Do they hate our country? They must hate our country because there’s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look, the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four. They want to let the Trump Tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, they want them to expire. Your taxes are going to go through the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:17)\n",
      "You take a look at regulations, they’re throwing regulations. You can’t breathe. You can’t even breathe with what they’re doing. You take a look at our border, so bad, there’s never been a border like this in the world. Four years ago we had the safest, best border in the United States. I built hundreds of miles of border wall. And they always say, “Oh, he didn’t build hundreds of miles,” because if there’s a board laying on the ground, they say “That’s a renovation.” They call it a renovation. If there’s two nails laying from 50 years ago, they say, “Oh, that was a renovation.” These are very dishonest people and you’re always fighting them.\n",

      "(12:54)\n",
      "And just a little note to Nikki, she’s not going to win. She’s not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already, not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn’t want to talk about, but she will be under investigation within minutes and so would Ron have been, but he decided to get out. He decided to get out. Now, Vivek, I don’t think would be at all because he’s perfect, right? And Tim Scott I know would never, that’s no chance. Hey, Tim. Do you want to say something? Come on, come on. I want him to say something.\n",

We love South Carolina, but next week it’s Nevada, and I’m pleased to announce we just won Nevada. We just won, 100%. Because all of them, they looked at it and they took polls, and I was polling at 95% to 4 or 5%, and they decided not to play in Nevada, so we just won Nevada. We have a man from Nevada here, Steve Wynn, wherever he may be. And John Paulson, the great John Paulson made plenty of money in Nevada. He doesn’t live there, but he makes a hell of a lot of money. He makes money everywhere he goes, actually, so money machine.\n",

But we go to Nevada and that’s been won, so we pick up all of those delegates, and then we do go to South Carolina where we’ve done really well, where I’ve done well, we have a great governor and lieutenant governor and great everything, because almost every one of them have endorsed me, two great senators, which is hard. I mean, did you ever think that she actually appointed you, Tim? And think of it, appointed and you’re the senator of his state and she endorsed me. You must really hate her. No, it’s a shame. It’s a shame… Uh-oh.\n",

We’re not going to have to do too much. We have a great team there, but it’s a team that we can now send someplace else. They did a fantastic job and it’s a fantastic place, really a fantastic place. But we’ll be leaving there very quickly. We’ll head out to South Carolina where I think we’re going to win easily. I think we’re 50 points up, 50. 50 points up on a person that was governor, that tells you something. But I felt I should do this because I find in life you can’t let people get away with bullshit, you can’t. You just can’t do that.\n",

      "And when I watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn’t so fancy, come up, I said, “What’s she doing, we won?” And she did the same thing last week, but he was much more angry about it than I was. I said, “Get up there and you let them know.” We are going to win this, we have no choice. If we don’t win, I think our country is finished, I do. I believe our country is finished. We have an opportunity to do something so amazing. And the good news and the reason we have such support, the best numbers I’ve ever had, the reason we have support is because they are so bad at what they’re doing and so evil, and they’re destroying our country.\n",

And I made a pledge to your state that you have the highest energy costs in the country. In the first year, they’re going to be reduced by 50% because we are going to drill, baby drill, drill, baby drill. Inflation is going to come way down, but in the first year, your energy costs are going down by 50%. Thank you very much. We love you. Thank you very much. We’ll see you soon.

      "Well, I want to thank everybody. This is a fantastic state. This is a great, great state. We won New Hampshire three times now, and we win it every time. We win the primary, we win the generals. We’ve won it and it’s a very, very special place to me, it’s very important. If you remember in 2016, we came here and we needed that winner. We won by 21 points and it was great. And today, I have to tell you, it was very interesting because I said, “Wow, what a great victory.” But then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely when it was at seven, but now I just walked up and it’s at 14, but she ran up when it was seven and we have to do what’s good for our party. And she was up and I said, “Wow, she’s doing a speech like she won.” She didn’t win, she lost.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And last week we had a little bit of a problem. And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, “Didn’t she come in third?” Yeah, she came in third. And then I looked at the polls. She was talking about most win ability, who’s going to win? And I had one put up, I don’t know if you see it, but I have one put up. We’ve won almost every single poll in the last three months against Crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll. And she doesn’t win those polls. And she doesn’t win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night, she had a very bad night.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And you have the now very unpopular governor of this state, this guy, he’s got to be on something. I’ve never seen anybody with energy. He’s like a hopscotch. And I’m watching this guy and two weeks ago he said, “We’re going to win. We’re going to win in the left side. We’re going to win.” About three days ago he started he started saying, “Well, we want to do well,” that’s a big difference. But I walked out just now, we’re 14 points up and I don’t know what it’s going to be, but when she was up here, it was six or seven and with 7% of the vote counted. Now, let me just tell you, we had an unbelievable week last week and Iowa, we set a record.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "It was the best in the history of the caucus, and I remember I had the same feeling. I’m up and I’m watching and I said, “She’s taking a victory lap,” and we beat her so badly. But Ron beat her also. Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she’s still hanging around. The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes. I don’t know if you saw that. Tremendous numbers of Independents came out because in this state, because you have a governor that doesn’t frankly know what the hell he’s doing in this state, in the Republican primary, they accept Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats before October 6th. They already voted. Now, they’re already voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible because if you remember, we won in 2016, and if you really remember it, if you want to play it straight, we also won in 2020 by more, and we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker. No, no, no. But we can’t let that happen. You have to have people that speak up. I said I can go up and I can say to everybody, “Oh, thank you for the victory, it’s wonderful.” Or I can go up and say, “Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and claimed a victory?” She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, “She’s going to win, she’s going to win, she’s going to win,” then she failed badly. Now, I have here if he promises to do it in a minute or less, but the only person more angry than let’s say me, but I don’t get too angry. I get even. The only person, because he was there and he did fantastically well by the way, then he endorsed me.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And we don’t have to talk about Tim Scott, who by the way just got engaged. We have to tell you, and that’s more important than all of this stuff. But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek. I said, Vivek. I said, “Vivek, go up and say a few words about it.” He has to do it in one minute or less, and then we’re going to just say, “We had one hell of a night tonight.” And one other thing before Vivek comes. Do you see that poll? We’re going to put it up. We have beaten Biden. You could almost say, “Who can’t? Who the hell can’t?” The man can’t put two sentences together. He can’t find the stairs off a stage who can’t? But Vivek, one minute or less, go do it, Vivek. \n",

      "Have we ever seen spirit like we have right now? Have we ever seen? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. You know why? Because we gave them a chance and they’re destroying our country. They’re destroying our country. Hello New Hampshire. I’m thrilled to be back in your beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. And let me begin by wishing you all a very Merry Christmas, remember we couldn’t say that? Seven years ago they didn’t want us to say it, but we now say it proudly and people are saying it right back at us. We’re just 38 days away from New Hampshire’s First in the Nation primary. And you know why you’re First in the Nation? Because I kept you First in the Nation. And I have to say, unlike Biden, he didn’t keep you first in the nation, that we know. On Tuesday, January 23rd, we’re going to win the New Hampshire primary and then we’re going to crush Crooked Joe Biden next November, and we’re going to make America great again. During this holiday season, families all across America, struggling under the brutal weight of crooked Joe’s failures, disasters, and heartless betrayals. You know that? While the stock market is making rich people richer, Biden’s inflation catastrophe is demolishing your savings and ravaging your dreams. His sky-high energy prices, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, are brutalizing your wallets. Our border has been erased. We have no border any longer. Drugs, criminals, gang members and terrorists are pouring into our country. They’re running wild in our Democrat run cities while Christians and conservatives are persecuted. And thanks to crooked Joe’s breathtaking weakness, he is bad. Worst president in history. The world is going up in flames while you suffer the ravages of inflation and your buying power goes down to levels never seen before. Your buying power has never been seen anything like this before.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:36)\n",
      "Joe Biden is a low IQ individual. He is truly the worst, most incompetent and most corrupt president in the history of our country. But with your vote in this election together, we’re going to save America and we’re going to bring our country back from hell. It’s in hell. It’s in hell. Not one thing has gotten better under crooked Joe Biden. Under the Trump administration you were better off. Oh, you were better off. Your family was better off. Your neighbors were better off. Your communities were better off and your country as a whole was better off. America was stronger, richer, safer, and more confident than ever. When you had a certain gentleman behind the desk, that beautiful resolute desk in the Oval Office, what was his name? His name was Trump. Happened to be Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:37)\n",
      "But it was all of you, actually. In a certain sense you were all sitting behind that desk because that’s what we’re all doing together. We’re in this together. We have a fight to save our country. We have a fight to save our country. Were you better off five years ago or are you better off today? No contest. There’s no contest. Nobody would say, nobody would say today, what a difference a president can make. It really does make a difference. A big difference. Bigger than even I thought. If you go back seven, eight years, I never thought it could make, it makes a tremendous difference.\n",

You’re not sending the people that when your jails, you’re not taking them back.” “Well, but sir, you haven’t paid us the money that you’re supposed to pay.” I said, “No, I’m not going to pay.” “Sir, really, there seems to be a misunderstanding.

They will do anything to win. They’ll do whatever they have, whatever they can. And remember this, Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He’s a threat. And we’ll bring in adversaries and I’ll bring it in right now. But even Vladimir Putin, has anybody ever heard of Vladimir Putin of Russia, says that Biden’s, and this is a quote, politically motivated persecution of his political rival, is very good for Russia, because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy. So, we talk about democracy, but the whole world is watching the persecution of a political opponent that’s kicking his ass. It’s an amazing thing.\n",

Viktor Orbán, the highly respected prime minister of Hungary, said, “Trump is the man who can save the western world.” He said this in an interview two days ago, that he had the best foreign policy in decades, and it all belongs to Trump. He did not initiate a new war, and it would’ve been the greatest thing. Our world would’ve been a very different place right now. And he said that. He said it would’ve been very different. And he’s right there, there’s no way that Russia would’ve invaded Ukraine. It would not be possible for Russians to do that if President Trump were president. It wouldn’t have happened. And guess what? It didn’t happen. And you know what else wouldn’t have happened? The attack on Israel wouldn’t have happened and inflation wouldn’t have happened.\n",

Trump is 67, Ron DeSanctimonious is 11, and Nikki Haley is at 10%. Where is the bounce? I want to see that bounce. Now, they keep bouncing between each other. In the new Rasmussen Poll, just out the general election, I’m I guess 10 points ahead. That’s not bad. In the Washington Post, how about that? 10 points and 11 points up on Biden.

You remember 2016, we really had to come in here and win it and we won it by 21 points, and the rest was history. We just went up and down the East Coast, through the Midwest we went through, and it was a beautiful thing to see. And I think even, if you look at 2020, we did better in 2020 than 2016. I think that right now we have the highest level of enthusiasm that anybody’s ever seen, ever for a [inaudible 00:00:59]. And the reason, the reason is, they are so bad.

The Democrats abandoned you and they abandoned also a place … You know where else they abandoned, right? Huh? Iowa, and we did very well. Did we do well in Iowa? I think we’re going to have the same kind of a result here as we did last week in Iowa. Iowa was great. They said, “Sir, it’s a little bit cold tonight.” I said, ” Is it 40 below zero?” They said, “No, it’s like about 10 degrees.” I said, “That’s like warm.” No, Iowa was great and you’re great.

I added the word “no” because that’s essentially what they do. I was going to say Americans for China prosperity, but they’re no good, they’re no good. They’re headed up by bad people.

No, but they’ve already got, you had to be signed up by October 7th. But think of it, Democrats to vote in the Republican primary, what kind of a governor would allow that?

Nikki Haley wants to change the working class … Just think of this. So you have a nice working class and they want to put a 23% national sales tax on everything that’s purchased. Do you think that’s good? Forget about middle class, how about poor people? They have to pay 23% when they buy something, while she raises, and she wants to do this, the Social Security retirement age by perhaps an extra 10 years because she’s talking about a certain life cycle. So you can labor until the day you die and then not collect a penny out of your benefits that you really are entitled to.

But Paul Ryan used to be Speaker of the House, not a good one. He led the Democrat ads.

This is not good because this is the same group that ran the horrible, most embarrassing moment in the country’s history, Afghanistan, where we lost soldiers should have never been lost. None of this stuff would’ve happened, none of this … I got it down to a point where we could get it … We had to get out, it was good, but I would’ve never let Bagram, that’s the Air Force base, one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.

We had the safest border in the history of our country, and now we have the most unsafe border in the history of the world. But they do the bidding for Wall Street. They want open borders … After the election, you wait and you see what happens. We’re going to win this election. We’re going to have a great border, we’re going to have more energy than you’ve ever had, and we’re never going back. So if you want a losing candidate who puts America last, vote for Nikki Haley. But if you want a president who puts America first, and did it successfully for four years, I’m the only … Did you ever read the stat that I’m the first president that didn’t go into and start a war? I finished some wars, like with ISIS. And remember when I was running against, and I don’t use that nickname anymore because I gave it to Biden, Hillary, beautiful, beautiful Hillary, remember when … And she got up and she said, “With his personality, we’ll be starting wars.” No, no, I finished wars.

On day one, I will terminate every open border policy of crooked Joe Biden and the Biden administration. And to stop the deadly drugs that are poisoning our people… We are losing, in my opinion, 300,000. Not a hundred, not 97, it’s been 97 for years. It’s 300,000, probably more than that, right, Joe? I would say probably… These are front row Joe’s over here. They follow me all over the place. I can’t get rid of them. I can’t get rid of them. These are all front row Joe’s. They’re fantastic. You must have a lot of money. No matter where I go… I say it’s front row Joe’s.

I have to be very careful when I say Obama’s name because the fake news, they say, “Did you ever realize that he gets the name Barack Obama confused with Biden?” They’re trying to say he’s cognitively impaired. And when I use it, because I figure Barack Hussein Obama is probably running things based on some of the people I see. So when I say Barack Hussein Obama is running things, they say, “Oh…” When I imitate him walking into a wall because he can’t find the stairs, they showed me… True. They show me sometimes.

Many presidents leave and there are things you can go after. And frankly, to be honest, that’s one of the reasons the Supreme Court is looking now at immunity. You have to have a guaranteed immunity for a president. Otherwise, a president’s not going to be able to function. They’re not going to move.

We’re not going to have any crime. But we protect… What we do, I mean, to me, it’s the best analogy. And our Democrat-run cities are dens of horrible crime right now.

You appoint somebody and they go out of their way to rule against you because they want to show that they are not in any way influenced by the fact that you appointed them. And you really do have two standards. It’s an incredible difference. And hopefully the Republican justices that we have and judges that we have will make correct decisions. And what I want is just fair and correct decisions. And the president has to have immunity.

I could make a deal for peanuts. They’re really talented people. They’re on a list of great artists because they want certain people doing… It’s the White House, and Biden gets $500,000 a painting.

I know them all, we’re not going to have World War III. We are so close to World War III, you have no idea. When I looked at those bombs a few days ago starting to drop all over the Middle East. I say, Middle East, here we come again. I got you out and got rid of ISIS. We’ll build an iron dome over our country, the state-of-the-Art missile defense shield, and it’s all made in the USA.

Ronald Reagan wanted to do it. I think he called it Star Wars. The problem was there was no technology. It was a great idea, but… Today we have unbelievable technology. I saw it. I saw missiles going into Saudi, Arabia, and I saw soldiers with extremely high IQs, not strong physically, but strong mentally. They go missile, missile, missile. They very calmly walk to a desk, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. The things traveling like 2,500 miles an hour and they’re cool as a cucumber. Bing, bing, bing.

You ever seen anything where they walk out of the stores with televisions and everything? The police are told, “Don’t do anything,” because they get sued. We’re going to indemnify all police officers and some precincts, depending on where they are. We’re going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty better than ever before. Our cities are falling apart. They’re all Democrat-run. They’re falling apart and they’re so crime-ridden. You can’t walk down the street without getting shot.

It looks like they put it in. The next day, I don’t know, the sun heats it up and it just disintegrates. It is the worst crap. Whoever made that stuff got away with a lot of money.

It’ll work out because things work out. Things work out. But look, they said, “Sir, I hope you don’t get a certain judge because it would be impossible to win.” I got that judge.

There’s cartons of paper, there’s beer cans all over the road, and they’ve been there for a long time. You can tell they’ve been there for a long time. It’s so sad to see. That’s our capital. You can’t walk across the street, you can’t walk outside. Three people were shot last week. They’re being shot all the time and dying in many cases. They come in from Nebraska, they come in from nice beautiful places like your great state. They come into the capital. They come in from New Hampshire and they come and they go and they want to see our great Washington DC and they go away, say, wow, — if they go away at all. But it’s very dangerous because people are getting shot all the time. I want the federal government to take over our capital, run it properly, and be very strong on crime, rebuild it, and get rid of the slum areas.

The new thing, I don’t know if you heard, I heard it yesterday, where they want women to be able to fight men. In other words, like in UFC or boxing, they want women to fight. By the way, they know how that works out because in gyms they’re all practicing, working out together. They know that doesn’t work out too well. But can you imagine? They want women to fight men. This is sick. It’s just crazy what’s going on. The weightlifting is something to behold. A record that stood for 18 years gets broken by a 157 pounds. They put in a quarter of an ounce and a quarter of an ounce and the women can’t do it. I can’t do it. They put in 150 pounds and the guy lifts it like it’s nothing. The whole thing is crazy.

If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as crooked Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done.

A lot of people aren’t too happy about that. Defeated… He said, “Unacceptable.” Yeah, no, they changed the name of a lot of our forts. We won two world wars out of a lot of these forts and they changed the name. It’s unbelievable. Defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. You did it. But now we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, its willpower, and it’s lost its strength. We are a nation that has quite simply lost its way, but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Three years ago, we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again, and it will happen fast. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country and it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country. We will fight for America like no one has ever fought before. 2024 is our final battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state, we will expel the warmongers. We will expel them.

Because in November it’s going to be big. It’s going to be bigger than anything’s ever happened to this country, I think. It really is of that magnitude, and I appreciate such a big turnout. We come to every little part of this place, and the people are greater and greater every stop. And we want to hit every corner, and we’re really honored to see the crowd that we had.

They all seem to be between 19 and 24 or 25. I wonder why that is. We’re going to be paying a price, but we’ll take care of it. If we get in, we’re going to be taking care of it.

They’re made much better.” I said, “Let’s leave them, right? Let’s leave them.” They’re actually saying it’s better. Ron DeSantis spent his entire career as a raging opponent of ethanol.

Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency and we win the presidency ’cause we’re going to do it together, it’s we more than I, I’ll have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine, settled, absolutely settled, and we will restore peace through strength all over our planet. And I’m the only candidate who can make this promise and mean it. I will prevent World War III, you are very close to a World War. You don’t have to be into it too much to know, you just have to see what’s going on, you are very close to a world war and it would be most likely a nuclear war. And if it’s a nuclear war, it’s obliteration. It’s a level of power that nobody’s ever seen and that nobody can even express and that frankly shouldn’t even be talked about. We wouldn’t talk about it in my administration and nobody else did either outside in other countries, but we wouldn’t talk about it.

An oilman told me, and he’s a great guy, a very successful guy, they say he looks at a piece of land, he takes a straw. Now it has to be a paper straw, so maybe it doesn’t work. The paper straws come wrapped in cellophane, do you ever see this? I mean, what’s going on? You got paper straws, they’re wrapped in cellophane. This country’s gone wild. But this man, he’s such a great oilman, a really amazing guy. He takes a straw and he puts it into the ground and oil comes out. The big companies go out, they spend billions looking for oil.

Wind is not… It’s intermittent. It’s extremely expensive, it’s 40 times more expensive, and we need stuff that’s not expensive. China, I see this guy, John Kerry flying in his private jet to China to talk to them about coal, please don’t do any… In the meantime, they’re building one coal plant a week and now, I understand it’s even two, but talk to them about energy, talk to them about coal, and then he leaves.

The tides bring it by, nobody ever talks about that. But the same thing with the air. When the coal spews out of their plant, when the smokestacks are roaring, because they’re big industry and that’s what fires up big industry. We want clean coal, we want to take care of our miners.

They can name it, they can say exactly where it’s going to be and when. And here we are working to try and compete with them and they’re using fossil fuel and we’re supposed to use wind. Wind.

The border’s a very big thing. I think the economy and the border and inflation, which is part of economy, but it’s something we have to talk about.

I’d like to make it much more complex. It sounds like science, they don’t go far, the batteries are too big. They’re very big, very heavy, dangerous. I just picked up a new point in cold weather, they’re really bad, dangerous in very cold weather, so you get pretty cold weather up here. I can tell you from my little 12-foot walk outside of the car, but in cold weather… And they’re very expensive drink and they’re all going to be made in China because they have the materials for that.

And I met with some of the big trucking companies and it took me about a minute to understand this, ’cause it was supposed to be fast studies, if you’re president. We have one that’s a very slow study, but it wouldn’t matter ’cause they must know this. And they explained, one man said to me, a big guy, one of the biggest guys in the business, he said, “For 50 years I’ve been in the business, and every year the trucks got better and better, faster, stronger, more beautiful.

If they make us go to electric, we will go back 50 years, we’ll be starting all over. It’ll be primitive, we’ll be starting all over.” And that made a big impact on me, it’s a very sad thing what’s happening. And they don’t want to hear about it. They want our army tanks to be all electric so that we… Think of it. Now, the problem is there, they don’t go far again, but the battery is so big that they’d have to pull a truck behind them. It’s true. They actually have a design, the army tank, and it’s pulling like this because the batteries are massive.

We’re going to go in, we’re going to be environmentally friendly as we blast our way through their front lines, but we’re doing it in an environmentally friendly manner. How crazy are we? They have jets now, and I ended it, but I’m sure they picked it up. They said, “Sir, we have a fuel that is unbelievably good in terms of the environment.” These are fighter jets that I bought about. I rebuilt our entire military. The entire military is rebuilt. They had jets that were 55 years old. We had fighter jets that were 55 years old.

You know the steps when you make your speech in front of millions of people and you’re making the beautiful speech, looking down to the white… That was one of the great scenes I’ve ever seen. By the way, I think J6 had an equal amount of people, it’s the biggest crowd I believe I ever spoke to. You never hear about that, do you? You have the hostages, the J6 hostages, I call them.

It’ll go down as one of the saddest things in the history of our country. And they went there to protest a rigged election, and now when the facts are in, now they see it as a rigged election. You saw the numbers come out last week, it was a rigged election. And those people have to be many of them… I guess there’s some.

Supreme Court is taking the case from Colorado, and so they’ll make a decision. And you know what I do find? And maybe say it, maybe don’t, but I say it, a Democrat judge appointed by let’s say Obama, they’re down and dirty.

And I’m also going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime. We’re going to protect our police. They’re afraid to do anything. They’re told not to do anything. When they walk into a department store in Chicago and they walk out carrying television sets and everything else, and the police, they want to do something, but they’re told not to do it.

He wants to build billions and billions of dollars a pier, a nice pier going way into, what happened to the environmental impact statement? Last time I wanted to build a pier, they tie you up forever, right? There’s no tying up. But here’s the problem.

With your vote we are going to win the state of Georgia in an epic landslide. And by the way, I have to tell you that I’ve done it twice. We did great the first time, 2016.

Because he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He’s screaming, screaming, and then coughing, ” Ah, Wow.” And he’s always using the right hand. He shakes his hand, then he gets off the stage. Did you notice nobody wanted to shake his hand? I wouldn’t, I’m a great American, but I don’t know if I want to go there. Now he’s always coughing into his hand and that’s, it’s not a real cough, it’s a nervous habit. It’s got to stop because there was no real cough. He just goes, “Agh, agh.”\n",

You know, FDR was a great orator. Beautiful tone, beautiful. He was born at a very patrician area, to put it mildly, very rich, very patrician, beautiful accent, beautiful words.

It’s impossible to win. Nobody’s ever done that before.” There’s never been a person that ran for president that wasn’t either a politician or a general, I think it’s 92% of politicians and 8% were generals.

I said, “So he’s an All-American.” I said, “Are you as good as your father?” He said, “Nope, not as good as my father.” That’s pretty good. You’re an All-American, and you say the father… See, I wouldn’t have said that. I would say I was better, then I’d have a problem with… But it’s a great family. And to Polly and everybody, thank you very much. Great job, what you’ve done. Benjamin and Isaac, Benjamin and Isaac, thank you for being here, fellas.

This is a tough cookie. That’s a great family. Thank you. What a great family. You didn’t see crowds like this with all the years. This is incredible. Isn’t that right? Never happened before. They don’t want to talk about it in the fake news. There’s never been a movement like this ever, where you come down… Look, Biden’s here today. He probably has 100 people. Legit people, I’d say 30. But they work hard and they probably have… That’s where he made the statement about apologizing for using the word illegal, but he had a very small crowd. But every place we go, we never have empty seats. We have lots of people standing outside, sometimes in the rain and the cold, but there’s never been anything like it. And this is about making America great again, so it’s very important. A friend of mine and somebody that should have been senator, and he was a really great senator, but he should have been senator, bad things happened, David Purdue. David, thank you. Good man. Another friend of mine. He headed up the hearings in Congress when he was going after Mueller. Remember that? You hear his voice. “Is it true that you this or that you that?” He’s like central casting, a friend, just a great guy. What he did at Congress was amazing. Jim and everybody else will testify to that. And he’s loved by the people in Georgia, and I assume he’s going to be doing something because he’s still a young man, Doug Collins. Thank you, Doug.

Bruce, thank you. Good job. An incredible senator. I have to tell you from day one, he was on the front lines, and he is a popular guy. People love him because he fights for justice.

We have some great, great people, great great people here, all of the great representatives that have worked so hard. From the very first day that we take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden, I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. I believe that every problem Joe Biden has created can be fixed. Every problem can be solved, and every injustice can be set right. We will bring this country back together through success. The word is success. They said it’s revenge. They said, “I’m out for revenge. I’m not out for revenge. My revenge will be success.”\n",

I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. Now, what that means is very simple. We get all these bad deals, we changed a lot of them, most of them, but still plenty of them out there, a lot of unfair deals. If China or any other country makes us pay a tariff for tax, let’s say 100 to 200%, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 to 200% right back. It’s called you screw us and we screw you, and everybody’s happy.\n",

We gave you the largest tax reduction in the history of our country and we’re going still further, and yet we took in more revenue than ever before. And as I said, for many years, I will always protect Medicare and social security, which others are not able to do, like Joe Biden. You’re not going to have it. It’s going to be gone. It’s Joe Biden who’s destroying them, and he is doing it with a migrant invasion. This migrant invasion is much more dangerous than you think in so many other ways. It’s going to have huge impact on rights that you’re entitled to, and that includes social security and Medicare. We will restore law and order to our country. I am going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime. They can solve the problem. We are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of the United States of America, Washington, D.C. Clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. People from Georgia go down to Washington now and they get shot. Horrible things are happening. You see graffiti all over the place. Beautiful columns built 200 years ago and 100 years ago, gorgeous columns. You say, how did they ever build them? How did they move them? They didn’t have the equipment to move them. They moved them through force of will. They got them there through force of will. You look at these massive structures and you say, how did they ever do that? They didn’t have caterpillar tractors. They didn’t have anything. They had their hands and their muscle, and they got it done. And now I see graffiti on it.\n",

On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school, any school at all pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. And I will keep men out of women’s sports. And I will fully protect and uphold our great and very important under siege Second Amendment. We will protect. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech, and I will secure our elections. We will secure our elections. If we don’t, we are a country in trouble. Our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID.\n",

We want to make it too big to rig. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done. So if you want to save America, then go vote. The Georgia primary is this Tuesday, March 12th and Georgia could be the state that puts us… Look, if we win Georgia, we’re going to win the election.

But no matter how hateful and corrupt the communists and criminals that we’re fighting against are, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage, and our American liberty is your God-given right. From Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus, beautiful Columbus, we just left Columbus and it’s quite a place, and from Athens to right here in Rome, we inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. But now, we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that is the highest inflation in 50 years, where banks are collapsing and interest rates are skyrocketing. Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy independent or energy dominant as we were just a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. “Please, please, please help us,” Joe Biden says, yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production, while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas of Alaska and elsewhere on our precious land.\n",

And now, we are a nation that wants to make our revered and very powerful army tanks the best anywhere in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact that they also are not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way. And they also want to make our fighter jets with a green stamp of energy savings, the losing 15% efficiency, but allowing us to keep our enemies atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels that they have never seen before.\n",

We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the US just as the price of oil reached an all time high. What other country would do such a foolish thing? What other country would be so self-destructive? Can we be energy independent, even dominant again? Yes oh yes, and quickly, says President Trump. Yes oh yes, we can. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan leaving dead soldiers, American citizens, and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind, and also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world and only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.

They wouldn’t even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was in the Oval Office. Iran was broke under the Trump administration. They didn’t have the money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, and all of the other instruments of terror that they funded previously. But those sanctions were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration. And now, Iran is a rich country again with $221 billion and another $6 billion that they got for hostages from us, and 10 billion for electricity to Iraq, all compliments of an incompetent Biden administration. They gave them so many compliments and they gave them so much money. And China with Taiwan is next.

We’ve got a federal bureau of investigation that won’t allow bad election changing facts to be presented to the public and which offers $1 million to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump to lie and say it was fact where Hunter Biden’s laptop from hell was Russian disinformation. And the FBI knew it wasn’t, but 51 intelligence agents said it was. And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead, and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry that no one even wants to think about. We are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press. Fake news is all you get. And they indeed, oh yes, they are indeed the enemy of the people. They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J. Trump who has done nothing wrong except win an election that was not supposed to be able to be won. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control like never ever before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions and trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own.

We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming, and whose educational system is ranked at the bottom of every single list.

We are a nation where fentanyl and other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug infested nation, crime ridden nation.

They don’t have the pilots to fly the planes, they don’t have qualified air traffic controllers, and they just don’t know what the hell they’re doing.

But if you’re a disillusioned Democrat, of which there are many today, I extend an open hand, an open invitation, and I ask you to join us on the noble quest of saving our country, saving our country.\n",

      "And so many other politicians and representatives and people that love Georgia, so many that if I ever announced them, would never get off, but I just want to thank you all for being here. We have some great, great people, great great people here, all of the great representatives that have worked so hard. From the very first day that we take back the White House from crooked Joe Biden, I believe we’re going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. I believe that every problem Joe Biden has created can be fixed. Every problem can be solved, and every injustice can be set right. We will bring this country back together through success. The word is success. They said it’s revenge. They said, “I’m out for revenge. I’m not out for revenge. My revenge will be success.”\n",

      "Before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled, and we will restore peace through strength. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. Now, what that means is very simple. We get all these bad deals, we changed a lot of them, most of them, but still plenty of them out there, a lot of unfair deals. If China or any other country makes us pay a tariff for tax, let’s say 100 to 200%, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 to 200% right back. It’s called you screw us and we screw you, and everybody’s happy.\n",

      "And as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families will come down. We gave you the largest tax reduction in the history of our country and we’re going still further, and yet we took in more revenue than ever before. And as I said, for many years, I will always protect Medicare and social security, which others are not able to do, like Joe Biden. You’re not going to have it. It’s going to be gone. It’s Joe Biden who’s destroying them, and he is doing it with a migrant invasion. This migrant invasion is much more dangerous than you think in so many other ways. It’s going to have huge impact on rights that you’re entitled to, and that includes social security and Medicare. We will restore law and order to our country. I am going to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime. They can solve the problem. We are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of the United States of America, Washington, D.C. Clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. People from Georgia go down to Washington now and they get shot. Horrible things are happening. You see graffiti all over the place. Beautiful columns built 200 years ago and 100 years ago, gorgeous columns. You say, how did they ever build them? How did they move them? They didn’t have the equipment to move them. They moved them through force of will. They got them there through force of will. You look at these massive structures and you say, how did they ever do that? They didn’t have caterpillar tractors. They didn’t have anything. They had their hands and their muscle, and they got it done. And now I see graffiti on it.\n",

And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. And I will keep men out of women’s sports. And I will fully protect and uphold our great and very important under siege Second Amendment. We will protect. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech, and I will secure our elections. We will secure our elections. If we don’t, we are a country in trouble.

We want to make it too big to rig. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done. So if you want to save America, then go vote. The Georgia primary is this Tuesday, March 12th and Georgia could be the state that puts us… Look, if we win Georgia, we’re going to win the election.

But no matter how hateful and corrupt the communists and criminals that we’re fighting against are, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage, and our American liberty is your God-given right. From Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus, beautiful Columbus, we just left Columbus and it’s quite a place, and from Athens to right here in Rome, we inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. But now, we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that is the highest inflation in 50 years, where banks are collapsing and interest rates are skyrocketing. Likewise, we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest levels in our history. We are no longer energy independent or energy dominant as we were just a few short years ago. We are a nation that is begging Venezuela and others for oil. “Please, please, please help us,” Joe Biden says, yet we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation anywhere in the world. We are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their oil production, while at the same time substantially increasing the price. And we met that threat by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas of Alaska and elsewhere on our precious land.\n",

We are a nation whose leaders are demanding all electric cars, despite the fact that they don’t go far, cost too much, and whose batteries are produced in China, where materials are only available in China, when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively in the United States but is not available in China. And now, we are a nation that wants to make our revered and very powerful army tanks the best anywhere in the world, all electric, so that despite the fact that they also are not able to go far, fewer pollutants will be released into the air as we blast our way through enemy territory in an environmentally friendly way. And they also want to make our fighter jets with a green stamp of energy savings, the losing 15% efficiency, but allowing us to keep our enemies atmosphere clean of emissions as we viciously and unceremoniously attack them at levels that they have never seen before.\n",

We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the US just as the price of oil reached an all time high. What other country would do such a foolish thing? What other country would be so self-destructive? Can we be energy independent, even dominant again? Yes oh yes, and quickly, says President Trump. Yes oh yes, we can. We are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan leaving dead soldiers, American citizens, and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment in the world behind, and also abandoning Bagram, one of the biggest military bases anywhere in the world and only one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. And we are a nation that allowed Russia and Ukraine to fight killing hundreds of thousands of people and it will only get worse.\n",

      "It would never have happened with me as your president. And for four straight years, it didn’t happen. Likewise, the horrifying attack on Israel would never have happened. They wouldn’t even have thought of doing such a thing if President Trump was in the Oval Office. Iran was broke under the Trump administration. They didn’t have the money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, and all of the other instruments of terror that they funded previously. But those sanctions were lifted by a corrupt Biden administration. And now, Iran is a rich country again with $221 billion and another $6 billion that they got for hostages from us, and 10 billion for electricity to Iraq, all compliments of an incompetent Biden administration. They gave them so many compliments and they gave them so much money. And China with Taiwan is next. We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things. There is no punishment.\n",

      "But when people who love our country protest on January 6th in Washington, they become hostages, unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time. We are a third world nation that has weaponized law enforcement against opposing political party like never ever before has happened in our country. We’ve got a federal bureau of investigation that won’t allow bad election changing facts to be presented to the public and which offers $1 million to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump to lie and say it was fact where Hunter Biden’s laptop from hell was Russian disinformation. And the FBI knew it wasn’t, but 51 intelligence agents said it was. And a Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud. And we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired and in no condition to lead, and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war, which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous world wars because of the weaponry that no one even wants to think about. We are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press. Fake news is all you get. And they indeed, oh yes, they are indeed the enemy of the people. They refuse to discuss the Biden crime family, but enjoy covering the false indictments of Donald J. Trump who has done nothing wrong except win an election that was not supposed to be able to be won. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control like never ever before. We are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions and trillions of dollars it has taken from us to build a military to rival our own. And less than three years ago, we had Iran, China, Russia, and North Korea in check. They respected us. They were afraid of us.\n",

We are a nation that is in many ways become a joke, and we are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, faith, and even hostile to God. We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming, and whose educational system is ranked at the bottom of every single list. We are a nation that just sold a once great company, United States Steel to Japan. We are a nation whose stock market’s continued success is totally contingent on MAGA winning the next election.

We are a nation where fentanyl and other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than groceries to feed our beautiful families. We have become a drug infested nation, crime ridden nation. We have become a nation like nobody thought possible In many cases. We have become, quite honestly, a horrible and unfair nation.

You sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won’t leave and they have no idea when they will, where ticket prices have tripled. They don’t have the pilots to fly the planes, they don’t have qualified air traffic controllers, and they just don’t know what the hell they’re doing. We are a nation that screens its citizens viciously at the ports, every single port. But if you are an illegal alien, you are allowed to flow through our southern border by the millions. So sad.

It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country, and it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country.

And I have polls that show me leading by a tremendous amount in New Hampshire and a lot in Iowa and nationwide were leading by almost 60 points. So I’m not exactly worried about it. I understand New Hampshire very well. I’ve won it twice and did very well with New Hampshire. I love the people. They love me, I think. We did a good job for New Hampshire economically and even from the standpoint of the military taking care of the vets. And I think we’re going to do very well in New Hampshire.\n",

But New Hampshire’s interesting, it’s a great place, a great state, unbelievable people, but they allow independents and Democrats to vote in the Republican primary. You say, what’s that all about?

He can’t put two sentences together and he’s representing us on nuclear weapons with Putin and Xi and all of these very smart people. The media hates when I say they’re smart, but let me tell you, they’re very smart and they’re very cunning. And I think you had very little chaos.

I’m the only president in 72 years, I didn’t have any wars. And they love that narrative, but they use that narrative because they have nothing else. Now, the new narrative they have, as you know, is I’m going to be a dictator. That’s going to be the new narrative. Because a guy like Biden, there’s nothing he can run on. Everything he’s turned out, it’s turned out badly. The border is a disaster. The worst border in history. I think the worst border in the history of the world.

We never got the kind of credit that I got on the economy. But we had the greatest economy in history. And you take a look at our numbers. The numbers were so much better than they are right now. We had no inflation. We were energy independent. We had so much energy, we were ready to start supplying energy, selling energy to Europe, Asia. We would’ve started to pay down our debt.

It’s horrible what has taken place. But it’s very interesting, when you look at Ron’s numbers, he’s practically out of the race. In fact, a lot of people say he’s leaving the race after Iowa because he’s doing so poorly. He’s also doing very poorly, as you know, in New Hampshire. I mean really poorly. And I’m leading Biden in every single poll that’s been taken over the last month or two. I just see one, I’m leading in Michigan by 11. That’s great.

He wants to be a dictator.” It’s interesting, I did a show, Sean Hannity, did you ever hear of him? He’s a very nice man. And he said essentially, “You’re not going to be a dictator, are you? Tell me.” I think he was trying to give me a nicer question than maybe you guys would. He meant it very well. I said, “I’m going to be a dictator for one day. We’re going to do two things. The border, we’re going to make it so tight you can’t get in unless you come in legally. And the other is energy. We’re going to drill, baby drill. After that, I’m not going to be a dictator.

The European countries took advantage of… I want to use the word starting with an S, but I don’t want to do it because I see some young, very good-looking children in the audience, and I assume they’re watching on television, but they took advantage of us on trade, and then they took advantage of us on our military protection. Of the 28 countries at the time, only eight countries were paid up. We were paying the difference. And I went to them. I said, “If you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.” And they said, “Do you mean that?” I said, “I mean that.” And the next day, billions of dollars poured into NATO. The reason they have money right now to prosecute what they’re doing with helping Ukraine is because of the money I got them. So peace through strength.\n",

      "We’re going to win the Iowa caucuses and then we’re going to crush crooked Joe Biden.next November. \n",
      "They’re not after me, they’re after you. \n",
      "I’m going to be there, we’re all going to be there together and we’re going to be first. You’re first in the nation because of me, but we’re going to be America first again. It’s America first. \n",
      "Thank you very much. Great woman. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. \n",
      "Well, you have Democrats in New Hampshire and they vote and you have independents in New Hampshire at large numbers and they vote. And I have polls that show me leading by a tremendous amount in New Hampshire and a lot in Iowa and nationwide were leading by almost 60 points. So I’m not exactly worried about it. I understand New Hampshire very well. I’ve won it twice and did very well with New Hampshire. I love the people. They love me, I think. We did a good job for New Hampshire economically and even from the standpoint of the military taking care of the vets. And I think we’re going to do very well in New Hampshire.\n",

      "Now, Chris Christie was in and he got a hot mic I heard about. I thought actually the biggest story wasn’t the fact that he dropped out. Nobody cared too much about that. But he had a hot mic where he was talking to somebody about the weather and he happened to say that she doesn’t have what it takes. She’ll be creamed in the election. And I mean, I know her very well and I happen to believe that Chris Christie is right. That’s one of the few things he is been right about actually. \n",
      "I don’t know if it does or not. Look, we’re winning tremendously here. I think we’re 20, 24 points up. I brought some polls if you want to see them, just in case. But I think we’re 24, 25 points up. But New Hampshire’s interesting, it’s a great place, a great state, unbelievable people, but they allow independents and Democrats to vote in the Republican primary. You say, what’s that all about? So it’s a little bit false in that regard, but even with that, I think we’ll win substantially. \n",
      "Oh, I like him. I knew I liked Robert. \n",
      "Thank you very much, Robert. \n",
      "Well, I think, first of all, I’m glad you’re asking the question and I’m very glad that you started off by saying you’re with me because I want you on my side. I figured maybe Fox would’ve written that question if it was just the second part of the question. But just so you understand \n",
      "We’ll figure that one out pretty soon. But they have chaos now. They have chaos at the border. They have chaos in the military. People are going woke. We have the greatest military in the world except for the top where they want to turn this beautiful thing we built. We beat ISIS, knocked them out. It was supposed to take four years. I did it in literally three months. It was supposed to take four or five years.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Ut we have chaos now. Look at today with Hunter Biden going into Congress and just sitting down and the bedlam that’s been caused. Today, you have chaos. We have, I think more with Joe Biden. He can’t put two sentences together and he’s representing us on nuclear weapons with Putin and Xi and all of these very smart people. The media hates when I say they’re smart, but let me tell you, they’re very smart and they’re very cunning. And I think you had very little chaos. I think most of the chaos was caused by the Democrats constantly going after me.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And remember this, remember that with phony Russia, Russia, Russia. I mean if you look at Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, everything was phony. The FISA warrants the lying to Congress. They had chaos. They were the ones that caused the chaos. We didn’t have chaos. We got the biggest tax cuts in history, the biggest regulation cuts in history. I had no wars. I’m the only president in 72 years, I didn’t have any wars. And they love that narrative, but they use that narrative because they have nothing else. Now, the new narrative they have, as you know, is I’m going to be a dictator. That’s going to be the new narrative. Because a guy like Biden, there’s nothing he can run on. Everything he’s turned out, it’s turned out badly. The border is a disaster. The worst border in history. I think the worst border in the history of the world. We had the best border in the history of our country. We never had a border like that.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So I think we had very little chaos. I think we had tremendous success. And frankly, until COVID came along, and then we did a great job on that too. We never got the kind of credit that I got on the economy. But we had the greatest economy in history. And you take a look at our numbers. The numbers were so much better than they are right now. We had no inflation. We were energy independent. We had so much energy, we were ready to start supplying energy, selling energy to Europe, Asia. We would’ve started to pay down our debt. And then when COVID came along, we had to do a little bit of a course change. But we had an incredible four years, again, the greatest economy in the history of our country with no inflation. Pretty good. \n",
      "Thank you, Robert. \n",
      "Well, it’s a witch hunt by… it’s weaponization, if you look at, it’s election interference by Biden because he can’t win at fair and square, so he’s doing that. And interestingly, you see what happened in Georgia with Fannie Willis and a million dollars almost to her boyfriend as the prosecutor of Trump. That one’s blown up now. It’s horrible what has taken place. But it’s very interesting, when you look at Ron’s numbers, he’s practically out of the race. In fact, a lot of people say he’s leaving the race after Iowa because he’s doing so poorly. He’s also doing very poorly, as you know, in New Hampshire. I mean really poorly. And I’m leading Biden in every single poll that’s been taken over the last month or two. I just see one, I’m leading in Michigan by 11. That’s great. The autoworkers are smart, they know that Biden has sold them down the tubes with the electric cars, all electric car mandate, the craziest thing I’ve ever heard. And they’re going to all be made in China too.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So I think when you look at what we’ve done, we are doing a great job and we did a great job and that’s why I’m leading in the polls by 60 and 70 points. \n",
      "Well of course that’s right. And of course I’m the one that had very little of it. Take a look at wars, again, I didn’t start, I wasn’t involved in wars. We beat the hell out of ISIS. We won 100%. We brought our troops back home. Look at the violence that we’ve had. Look at the violence we have recently with \n",
      "Bedlam? I think you look at Joe Biden, it’s bedlam. You have a man who can’t lead. You have a man who can’t find his way off a stage after he makes a speech that lasts for about two minutes. Now I think Bedlam is Joe Biden. I think that he’s using this. This is just a political ploy. “Trump is a dictator. He wants to be a dictator.” It’s interesting, I did a show, Sean Hannity, did you ever hear of him? He’s a very nice man. And he said essentially, “You’re not going to be a dictator, are you? Tell me.” I think he was trying to give me a nicer question than maybe you guys would. He meant it very well. I said, “I’m going to be a dictator for one day. We’re going to do two things. The border, we’re going to make it so tight you can’t get in unless you come in legally. And the other is energy. We’re going to drill, baby drill. After that, I’m not going to be a dictator. After that, I’m not going to be a dictator.” And the press \n",
      "No, no. And the press picks it up. So I said, I’m going to be a dictator for one day. They cut it, they go, “I’m going to be a dictator.” But they cut the rest of the sentence. No, no, I am not going to be a dictator. I’m going to manage like we did. We were so successful that the country was coming together. It was actually coming together and coming together well, it was a beautiful thing to see and we’re going to do that again. \n",
      "And by the way, that’s why I have the poll numbers that I have because the people, I think this audience is an example, I mean, I asked the question, I said, “How many people came last night? How many people came the night before?” And I got a very honest answer, not many compared to what we have. We had a great crowd and have a great crowd. Thank you very much. \n",
      "I have a lot of people that want to work with me. I have people calling. Just as I’m getting on the stage, I had a call from two of the very most important people in the military want to come to work for me. Everybody wants to come to work for us. We’re going to have no trouble. We had great people. We had a couple that were not great, stiffs as I would call them, but that’s true with anybody. But now I’ve gotten to know Washington, I’ve \n",
      "… gotten to know the people. I know the best. I know the smart ones, the dumb ones, the weak ones, the strong ones. And I think you’re going to see something like you’ve never seen before. And the people in this room know it. We did an amazing job and the reason we have support is because of the job we did.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Now, you like Ron DeSantis, but he wouldn’t even be around today. He’d be working in a pizza shop or perhaps a law firm if I didn’t endorse him. I endorsed him, took him from nothing to winning an election, and I was all for him. And then one day he said he’d run against me four years later after I got him in. And I said, “That’s not a loyal person. We can’t have that. That’s not a loyal person.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "So I think you’ll be very impressed with what we’re going to do. We’re going to have the greatest economy in the world, which we don’t right now. We have horrible, horrible inflation. And you’re never going to get that 30% down. You might even it, but you’re not going to get it down.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But thank you very much. I appreciate it. \n",
      "Well, I can’t tell you that, really. I know who it’s going to be. \n",
      "We’ll do another show sometime. \n",
      "Oh, sure, I will. I will. I’ve already started to like Christie better. \n",
      "I don’t see it. I don’t see it. That would be an upset, Christie for vice president. Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to announce… \n",
      "Good. \n",
      "Well, one of the things would be energy. Even though I set records on energy, but I was going to be energy dominant. We were energy independent and we had your bills down low. We had your gasoline for the car down to $1.87 a gallon. We had it down even lower than that at some points. Now it’s at 4 and $5 and that’s not acceptable. Your home heating bills are four and five times higher than they were with me. So I’d be doing that.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "I’d finish up the wall. We built over 500 miles of wall. That’s one of the reasons we had the great… And we got Mexico, by the way, we got Mexico, very importantly, to give us 28,000 soldiers free of charge. That’s more money than anybody can even imagine, free of charge. And we also remain in Mexico policy, not remain here, remain in Mexico. So we did a lot of great things. And I would just say we’re going to just keep expanding. We rebuilt the military. We even did something that hopefully nobody in this room needs so, but Right to Try, where we’re able to use space-age medicines that won’t be approved for four or five years, that work in many cases. And I saved thousands and thousands of lives with Right to Try.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Thank you very much. \n",
      "Oh, thank you. I knew that. I knew that when I looked at you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. \n",
      "A shutdown in terms of COVID or a shutdown in terms of budget? Because they’re talking about a budget shutdown right now, but you’re talking about a COVID shutdown? \n",
      "No, I wouldn’t. And I never did. I let the governors make their decisions. And some of them, like from South Carolina, you know Henry McMaster and frankly, North Dakota, a few of them, Tennessee, they didn’t shut down at all. Florida did shut down. Ron DeSanctus shut down, or, as he’s known, Ron DeSanctimonious. He shut his state down very violently, actually, and shut the highways down, the roads down. I’m a federalist in a sense because that’s the federalist way.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "No, I didn’t actually have a shutdown despite the fact that some people wanted to and some people didn’t want to. But we had some great governors. And the governors that did the best job were Republican governors and they were the ones that didn’t shut down. \n",
      "Thank you very much. \n",
      "Appreciate it. \n",
      "But if you go back and look at the records, you will see that the biggest fan of Dr. Fauci was Ron DeSanctimonious. He was a big fan. He said, “I go by” exactly quote, “I go by what Dr. Fauci said.” He said that two months in all the way through. And that eventually changed when that wasn’t the dessert of the day. But Ron DeSanctus was a big Dr. Fauci fan, and nobody wants to cover that. I say it every time. I don’t care if he was or not. But when they hit me with this question, Dr. Fauci was not a huge factor in my administration. He became a much bigger factor in Biden’s administration. He was there. He was somebody that was in government for 40 years. He did it for 40 years, so a long time. And what do I say, “You’ve been doing this for 40 years, get out.” But he wasn’t a big factor with me. He was a really big factor after I left with Biden. \n",
      "I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover. \n",
      "No, I think this. I think the economy is horrible except the stock market’s going up. And I think the stock market’s going up because… Stock market’s going up and I think the stock market’s going up because I’m leading Biden in all of the polls. Every poll. Every single poll for the last, with states that normally are not easy to lead. When you’re leading in Pennsylvania, you’re leading in Michigan, you’re leading in Wisconsin, we’re leading in virtually every state and of the swing states. And overall, we’re leading by a lot nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "But I would say this, we have a situation which I believe the stock market goes up because I’m leading. I think if I wasn’t leading, the stock market would be 25% lower. And I think frankly, if I didn’t win, I think the stock market would crash, I believe. \n",
      "Well, I think there will be a crash if I don’t win. And I say that and I do not want to be Herbert Hoover. Do you know who Herbert Hoover was? 1929 he was the president and that was not a good time to be. I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover. And I won’t be Herbert Hoover. \n",
      "Very easily. We were doing better than anybody has ever done for two and a half years. And then COVID came along. We were getting ready to start selling oil to Asia, to Europe. We were going to pay down our debt where we were at that time at like $29 trillion. Now we’re $36 trillion. But we were going to start paying down our debt. We were going to do things that nobody could believe.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "You take a look at Saudi Arabia, you take a look at some of these countries, take a look at Russia. Biden drove up the cost of energy. That’s what caused inflation. But it’s also what caused Putin to become rich enough to go and prosecute a war. And he never even talks about it. He’s the one that caused that war, both rhetorically and by the fact that he drove up the price of oil to a hundred dollars a barrel, which is getting close to record. And Putin was making a fortune. He’s the only guy who made a fortune during a war. If he didn’t have it… I was at $40 a barrel. If he was at $40 a barrel, Putin wouldn’t have done it.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Now, he wouldn’t have done it for another reason, me. He wouldn’t have done it. But he also wouldn’t have done it because he couldn’t have done it because oil wasn’t high enough. At a hundred dollars a barrel, he made a lot of money and he’s making a lot of money because it’s so high.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "It’s also what caused the inflation. Because energy is so big, it’s such a big deal that when energy goes up, if you make donuts, if you make hamburgers, anything you do, you have trucks that deliver your product, you have to heat your stoves, your ovens, anything you do, it’s all energy. And we had the highest cost of energy in history.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "When they talk about New Hampshire, New Hampshire has the highest price of energy, the highest cost of energy of any state in the nation. They should vote for me because I’m going to cut their energy price in half. \n",
      "I say very simply, we were starting to pay down debt. We were going to pay down a lot of debt. When COVID came along, if I didn’t inject this country with money, you would’ve had a depression the likes of which you’ve never seen. You had to inject money. We gave businesses that were going bankrupt, temporarily bankrupt, but they needed money. We helped businesses. If I didn’t do that, you would’ve had a depression in this country. That was a very good investment.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "And now what they should be doing, instead of the kind of debt that they’re building at record levels, they should be paying down their debt and they ought to go into the energy business instead of this green, new scam business that they’re in. \n",
      "We have a lot of cutting, but we also have a lot of income. We have more liquid gold under our feet, energy, oil and gas than any other country in the world. More than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia. And when I came in, we were number four. When I left, not that long a period of time, four years, we were number one by a lot. And we were soon going to double up Saudi Arabia and Russia combined. And we were going to make a lot of money. We have a lot of potential income. DeSantis wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. Nikki Haley wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. Nikki Haley wanted to raise the age from 65 to 74, 75 or 76. \n",
      "That’s what they say \n",
      "With a white and gold hat. \n",
      "Thank you very much. That’s beautiful. Thank you very much. \n",
      "Great question. It’s not sustainable for our country. We have millions and millions of people here. It is not sustainable. Did you see in New York City with it getting the regular students out and they’re putting migrants in their place? We are going to have the largest deportation effort in the history of our country. We’re bringing everybody back where they came from. We have no choice. We have no choice. \n",
      "Oh, I love you. \n",
      "That’s right. \n",
      "Yeah. Well, they’re going to be ended because the Democrats are going to end them because you can’t sustain it. If you look at New York, you have a mayor of New York who now is really hostile to the administration because New York City, that’s my place. I love New York. It’s gone. It’s had a tough time. The previous mayor was the worst mayor in the history of our country, de Blasio. Do you ever hear of de Blasio the worst? But what’s happened is this country cannot sustain 15 or 16 million people because I think that’s the real number. I think by the time his administration ends and hopefully quickly, it’s going to be 18 million people. That’s bigger than New York state, that’s bigger than just about every state other than one or two. 18 million people.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Remember this, many of those people come from jails and prisons. Many of those people come from mental institutions and in insane asylums, and many of those people are terrorists. I saw on Fox the other day, it was horrible but beautiful because from my standpoint in 2016 they had no terrorists that they know of that came into the country. None. You had the travel ban. They call it the Trump travel ban. They tried to make a big deal. The Supreme Court very intelligently approved it. Without that, we would’ve had blow ups. So we had no terrorist attacks at all during my four years. We had the Trump travel ban, and by the way, Iran was broke, Iran was broke. I said to China, if you buy oil from Iran, you’re not dealing in here. They immediately dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "India, France, Italy, all of these countries were buying from Iran. Iran would give out billions of dollars to terrorists. They had no money. I watched a Democrat congressman the other day on one of the shows and he said, “I’ll say one thing about Trump.” He said, “Trump. I’ll say one thing about Trump when he did that number on Iran, they were broke. They were absolutely broke.” When I left, they were broke. They had no money. There was no money for Hamas, for Hezbollah. There was no money for anybody. They had no money. And you would say that too. I mean, I think even the two of you would say they were absolutely stone broke. And you know how much money they have now? In three years under Biden they have $250 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Again, the energy business is a big business. And not to mention the five hostages that they paid $6 billion for. Not to mention, they got $10 billion for supplying some electricity to Iraq, which by the way they own and Iraq has $300 billion and essentially it’s a subsidiary of Iran. It should have never happened. Remember I used to say a long time ago when I was a civilian, now I’m sort of a civilian, but I think I’ll never be quite a civilian again. I’d love to be. But I used to say, don’t go into Iraq. Don’t do it. Don’t do it. But if you’re going to do it, keep the oil. Do you remember keep the oil. They didn’t keep the oil. So they have $300 billion and we have nothing. We have nothing. They used to say about wars to the victor belong to spoils. We go into some place, we obliterate it and then we leave. We are run by fools. We’re run by stupid people, but we ran it very smart for four years and we won everything. We won everything. \n",
      "Well, first of all, a lot of people would say that that’s not so bad. Look what they did. Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, the FBI, Twitter hoax, the 51 intelligence agents hoax. All of these different hoaxes that they did. I mean, a lot of people would say, that’s probably quite normal. I’m not going to have time for retribution. We’re going to make this country so successful again, I’m not going to have time for retribution and remember this, our ultimate retribution is success. When we had just prior to the China virus coming in, if you don’t mind, I’d like to be accurate as opposed to COVID, it is the China virus.\n",

      "It came out of Wuhan, and I said a long time ago to your show it came out of Wuhan. They were saying it came out of caves, bat caves, 2000 miles away. It came out of Italy, it came out of France. No, it came out of Wuhan, the labs, and by the way, I don’t think it was done. I think it was done out of incompetence. That’s what I think. I believe that a scientist went out, said hello to his girlfriend, and that was the end of that. She died and then people started dying all over the place. But who knows? Who knows? I can tell you one thing I got along with President Xi, but I took in $400 billion in tariffs and taxes from China, and one of the reasons China’s not doing so well today is because of those tariffs and Biden wants to cut them.\n",

      "He got paid off by China after all so he wants to help the people that gave him a lot of money, but he is a Manchurian candidate in a true sense. He got money from China, he got money from Russia. You remember the debate where Chris Wallace, how is he doing I wonder. But Chris Wallace, when I said to Biden, I asked him a question. I said, how come you got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife and Chris Wallace wouldn’t let me ask me. I said, why are you stopping this? Now it’s turned out to be a big deal. I got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife. I tell you this, we’re going to have a success that’s so great that I won’t have, hopefully, I won’t have time for retribution. There won’t be retribution. There’ll be success. \n",
      "I own hotels all over the… I don’t get free money. Somebody rents a hotel room, et cetera, et cetera. Much money I gave back. In fact, I didn’t have to do it. George Washington was a very rich man. People don’t know that. In his essentially White House, which wasn’t built, but they had an office, he had a business desk and he had a country desk right next to each other. You’re allowed to do that. I didn’t do it. I put everything in trust and if I have a hotel and somebody comes in from China, that’s a small amount of money and it sounds like a lot of money. That’s a small… But I was doing services for that.\n",

I have great stuff, and they stay there and they pay. I don’t get $8 million for doing nothing like Hunter. I don’t get $500,000 for doing a painting. It’s not a bad idea, I guess if you can get away with it. When I heard that one, I said, there’s no way they get away with that. But they got away with that. I guess they got away with it. No, there was an  lawsuit against me where the radical left sued me for that and I won the suit and the judge said, “They go to his hotels. What’s he going to do?” \n",
      "Okay. \n",
      "So, that’s a great question. I appreciate it too. You wouldn’t be asking that question even talking about the issue because for 54 years they were trying to get Roe. V. Wade terminated and I did it and I’m proud to have done it. They wanted to get it back, right? You wouldn’t have that because there would be no question. Nobody else was going to get that done. \n",
      "And we did it and we did something that was a miracle. When I walked onto the stage today, a gentleman in the back, probably works for Fox, nice guy said, “Sir, I’d like to thank you.” I said, “For what?” He said, “You saved 2 million lives in the last three years. You saved 2 million lives.” And I said, “Thank you very much.” I knew exactly what he meant. 2 million lives, and nobody’s done more in that regard than me. Now, I happen to be, for the exceptions, like Ronald Reagan with the life of the mother, rape, incest, I just have to be there. I feel, I think probably 78%, I saw a poll, about 78% it was Ronald Reagan, he was for it. I was for it. But I will say this, you have to win elections, otherwise you’re going to be back where you were and you can’t let that ever happen \n",
      "And again, you’ve got to win elections. If you look at it, Ron DeSantis, I don’t know what he really believes because you never know with a politician and he’s just another politician as far as I’m concerned. But his poll numbers have gone down to a level that he’s going to be out of the race very soon. He’s going to be out very soon. I watched him last night. He’s standing up with his shoes, his fancy shoes, and he’s going to be out of the race within, a lot of people say before New Hampshire. I don’t know if that were the reason. I hope it wasn’t the reason. I hope it’s for other reasons. I can see a lot of other reasons why he shouldn’t be, but he’s doing very, very poorly. It happened to coincide with that because a lot of people say if you talk five or six weeks, a lot of women don’t know if they’re pregnant in five or six weeks. I want to get something where people are happy. This has been tearing our country apart for 50 years. Nobody’s been able to do anything.\n",

      "And again, you can only ask that question and you ask it brilliantly, and I understand exactly where you’re coming from. I love where you’re coming from, but we still have to win elections and they’ve used this… We have some great Republicans and they’re great on the issue and you would love them on the issue. And a lot of them have just been decimated in the election. Decimated. I mean, absolutely. We’re going to come up with something that people want and people like. I would love you to… First of all, you have to go with your heart. You have to go with your heart first. Go with your heart, your mind, go with it. But you do also have to put in there a little bit. You have to win elections. But if it weren’t for me with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn’t even be talking about this stuff, you wouldn’t be asking that question because we’d write back… Remember this, they’re the radicals, we’re not the radicals, because they’ll kill a baby.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Remember I had the debate with crooked Hillary Clinton, which I don’t call it crooked anymore, I use that now for Joe Biden as you know. I call her beautiful Hillary. She’s a beautiful woman. But in the debate with Hillary Clinton, they said she’s willing to rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month. And I never heard this. It happened to me. It just came to me during that debate. I didn’t go up there thinking I was going to say that. And she even winced. Nobody wants to see that happening after a certain period of time. Nobody. They’re the radicals because they’re willing to kill the baby in eight months, nine months, or even after birth. If you remember the former governor of Virginia where he said, you kill the baby after the ninth month or even afterwards, you set the baby aside and you have a conversation with the mother and if the conversation… Can you imagine? But these are the radicals.\n",

      " \n",
      "We’re not the radicals. We are not the radicals, but we’re living in a time when there has to be a little bit of a concession one way or the other. And I think I want to get it right. I have to get it right. But without what I did, you would never even be asking that question because there was no chance that that was going to happen. For 54 years, they campaigned on that issue and nobody pulled it off but me. So I think you’re going to be happy in the end. Thank you very much. \n",
      "Oh, I like it. \n",
      "Thank you. \n",
      "Yeah, do it through peace through strength. I just saw something where I was the only president, for 78 years, no war started. Now I wiped out ISIS. I did a thing that was, I won’t go into names, I won’t go into specifics, but we did a thing that nobody thought was possible, did it very quickly. I withdrew from Syria, I withdrew from Iraq, I withdrew. They want to put people back. We’re in countries that don’t even want us. We’re with countries that a lot of you never even heard the names of these countries. There’s a great leader, in my opinion, is very strong. Some people say it’s terrible to say that, but he is, Viktor Orban. He’s the Prime Minister of Hungary. And they asked him, “What would you do? There are wars all over the world right now.” He said, “What I do is make sure the American people vote for Donald Trump for president, because when he was president, China feared him.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "I don’t want to be feared. But he used the term, I’m not using the term, President Xi’s a very tough cookie. But I think they did fear us. China feared him. Russia feared him. Everybody. I even got along with Kim Jong Un. Getting along with people with hundreds of nuclear weapons, it’s not a bad thing. They want to make it like a bad thing. It’s a very good thing. But peace through strength, they didn’t want to mess around. It would’ve never happened in Ukraine, Russia would’ve never gone in. Would’ve never happened, the recent attack on Israel. Would’ve never happened. A hundred, I mean 0% chance that was going to happen  repaired.\n",

      "And I rebuilt our entire military and think of it, Biden gave $85 billion worth of our military to Afghanistan so stupidly. Brand new tanks and planes and everything. 700,000 rifles and guns, 70,000 vehicles, many of them armor plated vehicles. And by the way, people died, 13 great soldiers died. I’ve gotten to know the families very well. Many horribly hurt and hundreds of people killed when you include those hundreds of people killed in the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. So I really appreciate the question and I appreciate very much that you’re with me and I’m with you, too. Thank you. \n",
      "Hundreds of billions of dollars. \n",
      "Depends if they treat us properly. Look, NATO has taken advantage of our country. The European countries took advantage of… I want to use the word starting with an S, but I don’t want to do it because I see some young, very good-looking children in the audience, and I assume they’re watching on television, but they took advantage of us on trade, and then they took advantage of us on our military protection. Of the 28 countries at the time, only eight countries were paid up. We were paying the difference. And I went to them. I said, “If you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.” And they said, “Do you mean that?” I said, “I mean that.” And the next day, billions of dollars poured into NATO. The reason they have money right now to prosecute what they’re doing with helping Ukraine is because of the money I got them. So peace through strength. \n",
