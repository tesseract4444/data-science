      "\n",
      "Inhalt: \n",
      "Joe Biden (00:01):\n",
      "\n",
      "Please have a seat. As you know, I just concluded several hours of meetings with President Xi, and I believe they were some of the most constructive and productive discussions we’ve had.\n",
      "\n",
      "(00:13)\n",
      "I’ve been meeting with President Xi since both of us were vice president over 10 years ago. Our meetings have always been candid and straightforward. We haven’t always agreed, but they’ve been straightforward. And today, built on the groundwork we laid over the past several months of high-level diplomacy between our teams, we’ve made some important progress, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(00:33)\n",
      "First, I am pleased to announce that after many years of being on hold, we are restarting cooperation between the United States and the PRC on counternarcotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "(00:44)\n",
      "In 2019, you may remember, China took action to greatly reduce the amount of fentanyl shipped directly from China to the United States. But in the years since that time, the challenge has evolved from finished fentanyl to fentanyl chemical ingredients and pill presses, which are being shipped without controls. And, by the way, some of these pills are being inserted in other drugs, like cocaine, and a lot of people are dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:11)\n",
      "More people in the United States between the ages of 18 to 49 die from fentanyl than from guns, car accidents, or any other cause. Period.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:21)\n",
      "So, today, with this new understanding, we’re taking action to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals and pill presses from China to the Western Hemisphere. It’s going to save lives, and I appreciate President Xi’s commitment on this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:36)\n",
      "President Xi and I tasked our teams to maintain a policy and law enforcement coordination going forward to make sure it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:43)\n",
      "I also want to thank the bipartisan congressional delegation to China led by Leader Schumer, in October for supporting this effort so strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:55)\n",
      "Secondly, and this is critically important, we’re reassuming military to military contacts, direct contacts. As a lot of you press know who follow this, that’s been cut off and it’s been worrisome. That’s how accidents happen: misunderstandings. So we’re back to direct, open, clear, direct communications on a direct basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:17)\n",
      "Vital miscalculations on either side can cause real trouble with a country like China or any other major country, and so I think we made real progress there as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:32)\n",
      "And thirdly, we’re going to get our experts together to discuss risk and safety issues associated with artificial intelligence. As many of you who travel with me around the world almost everywhere I go, every major leader wants to talk about the impact of artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:47)\n",
      "These are tangible steps in the right direction to determine what’s useful and what’s not useful, what’s dangerous and what’s acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:55)\n",
      "Moreover, there are evidence of cases that I’ve made all along. The United States will continue to compete vigorously with the PRC. But we’ll manage that competition responsibly so it doesn’t veer into conflict or accidental conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:12)\n",
      "And where it’s possible, where our interests coincide, we’re going to work together like we did on fentanyl.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:19)\n",
      "That’s what the world expects of us, the rest of the world expects, not just people in China and the United States, but the rest of the world expects that of us. And that’s what the United States is going to be doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:30)\n",
      "Today, President Xi and I also exchanged views on a range of regional and global issues, including Russia’s refusal and brutal war to stop the war, and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:44)\n",
      "And as I always do, I raised areas where the United States has concerns about the PRC’s actions, including detained and exit-banned U.S. citizens, human rights, and coercive activities in the South China Sea. We discussed all three of those things. I gave them names of individuals that we think are being held, and hopefully we can get them released as well. No agreement on that. No agreement on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:10)\n",
      "I also stressed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:14)\n",
      "It’s clear that we object to Beijing’s non-market economic practices that disadvantage American businesses and workers and that we’ll continue to address them. And I named what I thought a number of those were.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:29)\n",
      "I welcome the positive steps we’ve taken today, and it’s important for the world to see that we are implementing the approach in the best traditions of American diplomacy. We’re talking to our competitors. And the key el… And just talking, just being blunt with one another so there’s no misunderstanding is a key element to maintaining global stability and delivering for the American people.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:52)\n",
      "And in the months ahead, we’re going to continue to preserve and pursue high-level diplomacy with the PRC in both directions to keep the lines of communication open, including between President Xi and me. He and I agreed that either one of us could pick up the phone, call directly, and we’d be heard immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:10)\n",
      "And that’s… Now I’d like to be able to take some questions, if I may. And I’m told that Demetri of the Financial Times has the first question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demetri (05:21):\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. And as an Irishman, I apologize for bringing the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (05:26):\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, holy God, I wouldn’t have called on you if I had known that. No, I’m teasing. Go ahead. Fire away, Demetri.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demetri (05:31):\n",
      "\n",
      "President Biden, given that America is playing a key role in two major global crises, Ukraine and in Gaza, does that alter your previous commitment to defend Taiwan from any Chinese military action? And did Xi Jinping outline the conditions under which China would attack Taiwan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (05:47):\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, I reiterate what I’ve said since I’ve become president and what every previous president of late has said, that we maintain an agreement that there is a One China policy and that… And I’m not going to change that. That’s not going to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:05)\n",
      "And so, that’s about the extent to which we discussed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:12)\n",
      "Next question, sorry, was Bloomberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 3 (06:18):\n",
      "\n",
      "Good evening, Mr. President. It appears, among other issues, that your agreement with President Xi over fentanyl will require a lot of trust and verification to ensure success in curbing those drug flows. I’m wondering: After today and considering all that you’ve been through in the past year, would you say, Mr. President, that you trust President Xi?\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:38)\n",
      "And secondly, if I could, on Taiwan. You and your administration officials have warned President Xi and China about interference in the upcoming election. I’m wondering what would the consequences be if they do, in fact, interfere in the election. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (06:54):\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I may have had that discussion with him, too. I made it clear: I didn’t expect any interference, any at all. And we had that discussion as he was leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:02)\n",
      "Look, do I trust? You know, I “trust but verify,” as the old saying goes. That’s where I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:09)\n",
      "And, you know, we’re in a competitive relationship, China and the United States. But my responsibility is to make this rational and manageable so it doesn’t result in conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:28)\n",
      "That’s what I’m all about, and that’s what this is about: to find a place where we can come together and where we find mutual interests that… But, most importantly, from my perspective, that are in the interests of the American people. That’s what this is about, and that’s exactly what we’ll do.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:48)\n",
      "We’re in a situation where we agreed that fentanyl and its precursors will be curbed substantially. And the pill presses, that’s a big movement they’re doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:02)\n",
      "And, by the way, you know, I won’t… I guess I shouldn’t identify where it occurred. But, John, I know two people near where I live. Their kids literally, as I said, they woke up dead. Someone had inserted in… Whether the young man did or not, inserted in a drug he was taking, fentanyl.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:26)\n",
      "Again, I hope you don’t have any experience with knowing anyone, but this is the largest killer of people in that age category.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:36)\n",
      "And, you know, I guess the other thing I think is most important is that since I… I’ve spent more time with President Xi than any world leader has, just because we were vice presidents. His president was President Hu; I’m not making a joke. President Hu and President Obama thought we should get to know one another. It wasn’t appropriate for the President of United States to be walking, dealing with the vice president.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:09)\n",
      "So we met… If I’m not mistaken, I think it was 68 hours of just face-to-face… Just us and a simultaneous interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:18)\n",
      "So, I think I know the man. I know his modus operandi. He’s been… We have disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things. But he’s been straight. I don’t mean that he’s good, bad, or indifferent. He’s just been straight.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:33)\n",
      "And so, you know, we… As I said, the thing that I find most assuring is he raised and I fully agreed that if either one of us have any concern, Mr. Ambassador, any concern about anything between our nations or happening in our region, we should pick up the phone and then call one another, and we’ll take the call. That’s an important progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:00)\n",
      "I’m embarrassed. I think it’s CBS, but I can’t remember who with CBS. I’m sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weija Wang (10:04):\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President. Weijia Jiang with CBS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (10:07):\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, I apologize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weija Wang (10:14):\n",
      "\n",
      "You continue to stress the need to ensure competition with China does not veer into conflict or confrontation. In the past two years, there have been more than 180 incidents of Chinese aggression against U.S. Aircraft in the Indo-Pacific and, of course, the ramped up military activity in the South China Sea. If that does not count as veering into confrontation, then what does? And did you issue any warnings Xi against continuing that behavior?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (10:44):\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, first of all, none of it did end up in a conflict. Number one.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:49)\n",
      "Number two, you may recall: I did a few little things like get the Quad together, allow Australia to have access to new submarines, moving in the direction of working with the Philippines. So, our actions speak louder than our words. He fully understands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weija Wang (11:13):\n",
      "\n",
      "And because of the news of the day, sir, I do have a question about the IDF raid on the Al-Shifa Hospital, as it tries to contain and take out the Hamas operative that is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:25)\n",
      "This week, you also said that we must protect hospitals. So, when you weigh the target against the number of civilians inside the hospital, is the operation underway justified?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (11:42):\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, look. We did discuss this, by the way. But we can’t let it get out of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:50)\n",
      "Here’s the situation: You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military, hidden under a hospital. And that’s a fact. That’s what’s happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:06)\n",
      "Israel did not go in with a large number of troops, did not raid, did not rush everything down. They’ve gone in and they’ve gone in with their soldiers carrying weapons or guns. They were told… Told, let me be precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:25)\n",
      "We’ve discussed the need for them to be incredibly careful. You have a circumstance where you know there is a fair number of Hamas terrorists. Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, to where they were cutting babies’ heads off to burning women and children alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:50)\n",
      "And so, the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic. This is not the carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels. They’re going in the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:02)\n",
      "And if you notice, I was mildly preoccupied today. I apologize. I didn’t see everything. But what I did see, whether… I haven’t had it confirmed yet. I have asked my team to answer the question. But what happened is they’re also bringing in incubators. They’re bringing in other means to help the people in the hospital, and they’ve given the doctors and — I’m told — the doctors and nurses and personnel an opportunity to get out of harm’s way.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:32)\n",
      "So, this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, an indiscriminate bombing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:40)\n",
      "What do you got? Washington Post. I think that’s right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 5 (13:44):\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (13:48):\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, there you are. Sorry. I couldn’t see you in the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 5 (13:52):\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s okay. Mr. President, Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in just over a month and created–\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (14:06):\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m sorry, you’re breaking up. I didn’t… Would you…\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 5 (14:07):\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in just over a month and created a humanitarian disaster. Israeli officials have said this war could take months or even years. Have you communicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu any sort of deadline or timeframe for how long you are willing to support Israel in this operation? Are you comfortable with the operation going on indefinitely? And is there any deal underway to free hostages? Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (14:30):\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. No. Working backwards forward. Look, I have been deeply involved in moving on the hostage negotiation, and I don’t want to get ahead of myself here because I don’t know what’s happened in the last four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:49)\n",
      "But I have… We’ve gotten great cooperation from the Qataris. I’ve spoken with them as well a number of times. I think the pause and that the Israelis have agreed to is down to… I’m getting into too much detail. I know, Mr. Secretary. I’m going to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:14)\n",
      "But I am mildly hopeful. I’m mildly hopeful.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:20)\n",
      "With regard to when is this going to stop, I think it’s going to stop when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse and just do horrific things to the Israelis. And they are in… And they still think they… At least as of this morning, they still thought they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:48)\n",
      "I guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing in the hospital, knocking down doors, and, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:21)\n",
      "But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking the Israelis again. And this is a terrible dilemma. So, what do you do?\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:34)\n",
      "I think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks being killed one-to-one going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls. But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters, weapons, materiel below this hospital and, I suspect, others. But how long it’s going to last, I don’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:59)\n",
      "Look, I made it clear to the Israelis that… And to Bibi and to his War Cabinet that I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that’s real. We got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without worrying about whether or not we’re just dealing with… They’re dealing with Hamas, that’s going to engage in the same activities they did over the past… On the 7th.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:33)\n",
      "So, it’s… But I can’t tell. I’m not a fortuneteller. I can’t tell you how long it’s going to last. But I can tell you I don’t think it ultimately ends until there’s a two-state solution. I made it clear to the Israelis I think it’s a big mistake for them to think they’re going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. I don’t think that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:51)\n",
      "And so, we’re going to… I think you’re going to see efforts to bring along… Well, I shouldn’t go into it anymore, because that’s things I’ve been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what the next steps are.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:05)\n",
      "But anyway, thank you all very much. Appreciate it very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karine Jean-Pierre (18:09):\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. This ends the press conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 7 (18:11):\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, on the hostages, you said, “We’re coming for you.” What did you mean when you said, “We’re coming for you”?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (18:23):\n",
      "\n",
      "When Hamas said they plan on doing the same thing again, what they did, what they did on the 7th. They’re going to go in and they want to slaughter Israelis. They want to do it again. And they’ve said it out loud. They’re not kidding about it. They’re not backing off.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:38)\n",
      "And so, I just asked the rhetorical question, “I wonder what we would do if that were the case?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 7 (18:46):\n",
      "\n",
      "On the hostages though, you said, “We’re coming for you.” What did you mean to the American hostages when you said, “Hang tight. We’re coming for you”?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (18:50):\n",
      "\n",
      "What I meant was I’m doing everything in my power to get you out. Coming to help you to get you out. I don’t mean sending military in to get them. Is that what you thought I might mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 7 (19:00):\n",
      "\n",
      "I defer to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (19:01):\n",
      "\n",
      "No, no, no. I was not talking about a military. I was talking about you’re on our mind every single day. Five to six times a day, I’m working on how I can be helpful in getting the hostages released and have a period of time where there’s a pause long enough to let that happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:20)\n",
      "And there’s somewhere between 50 and 100 hostages there, we think.\n",

      "(01:20)\n",
      "How is everyone tonight? Look at you, such beauty and boldness. I’m so proud that this community has made DC such a thriving, welcoming home to LGBTQ+ people. It’s a remarkable departure from where we had been when DC was a place where outing was used as a political weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:55)\n",
      "Tonight, we can celebrate without fear or shame, but despite the freedom and acceptance we have fought for in places like DC, we know that in too many other parts of our country, these rights and freedoms are under attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:18)\n",
      "Across the country, in places like Texas and Florida and Alabama, LGBTQ individuals don’t have the freedom to be honest with their family or embrace their gender identity at work. They don’t have the freedom to walk down the halls of their school, as their authentic self. They don’t have the freedom to hold hands with their partner on the sidewalk.\n",
      "\n",
      "(02:48)\n",
      "While we celebrate this beautiful community tonight, let’s also remember how lucky we are, and harden our resolve to advocate for those who are not. We look forward to a time when all people, in all places can feel the freedom and the joy that we feel here tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:22)\n",
      "Until then, we fight. We fight for the trans individuals, who are being bullied and killed. We fight for the LGBTQ kids who are forced into conversion therapy. We fight for the communities around the world where being gay is punishable by death.\n",
      "\n",
      "(03:46)\n",
      "Joe and I stand firmly and proudly with you in these fights, and we will be with you every step of the way. There’s nobody that I’d rather have in my corner than my husband Joe Biden. Joe has always been a fierce advocate for this community, and I am so proud of all the work that he has done for the LGBTQ+ individuals here in the US, and around the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(04:33)\n",
      "I am so honored to introduce him tonight, so please welcome the President of the United States, Joe Biden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (04:59):\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. Hello. Hello. My name’s Joe Biden. I’m Jill’s husband. Folks, let me begin with a sincere thank you. Please, have a seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 2 (05:15):\n",
      "\n",
      "We love you, Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (05:16):\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, thank you. I hope you understand that you are the beacon of light around the world, not a joke. Whether I was in India, wherever I am, LGBTQ community comes up to me and says, “Can you help?” Not a joke. Not a joke. “Can you help? You’ve given people so much hope.” It’s all about hope. Think about it, how do you live without hope?\n",
      "\n",
      "(05:43)\n",
      "This community in the United States of America is leading the world, and giving people hope. Folks, my first thing I want to say tonight, thank you, thank you for changing lives around the world. You’re doing it. You really are.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:02)\n",
      "For some of you who are close to my age, it wasn’t easy to do. No. I’m not joking. You lose your job. You get beat up. You get the whole different circumstance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 2 (06:11):\n",
      "\n",
      "[inaudible 00:06:14].\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (06:15):\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I’ll tell you what, I’ve been here every time you’ve invited me. Be careful, I’m like a poor relative, I show up when I’m invited. Look, Kelly Robinson, thank you. Thank you for the introduction and for your leadership, and congratulations to tonight’s awardees, Shonda Rhimes, an unstoppable creative force, Lena [inaudible 00:06:36], I’ll tell you what, path breaking storyteller, and Matt Bomer, an actor who inspires, and you do inspire, Matt. [inaudible 00:06:46] and Daniel [inaudible 00:06:48] courageous young activists who lift our hopes up for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "(06:52)\n",
      "Earlier this year, they were kind enough to invite Jill and me to the Trans Youth Prom. We couldn’t make it, but it sounds like you had a hell of a lot of fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:04)\n",
      "These young honorees joined us in June for the largest Pride Month celebration ever, ever held at the White House, and there’s going to be more at the White House. LGBTQ youth are among the bravest people I know, and you four are no exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:24)\n",
      "Folks, this is the fourth time I’ve joined this dinner, coming back to my days as vice president. At this pivotal moment of history, Jill and I have come here tonight to say thank you for your courage, thank you for your hope, and thank you for your pride. Thank you for defending equal rights and dignity of all people, despite intense opposition and hate-fueled rhetoric, even violence to try to keep people moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "(07:53)\n",
      "You inspire us, and I want you all LGBTQ Americans to know the Biden/Harris administration has your back. I don’t know who’s hollering down there but I can’t hear you.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:03)\n",
      "Well, look-\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 2 (08:03):\n",
      "\n",
      "[inaudible 00:08:09].\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (08:13):\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t hear her. What’s she saying? Well, thank you, whatever you’re saying, I can’t hear you.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:20)\n",
      "Look, I’ve been labeled the most-\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaker 2 (08:24):\n",
      "\n",
      "Four more years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Biden (08:24):\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, I get it. I’m not sure that’s a good thing. No. I’m only joking.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:38)\n",
      "Look, I’ve been labeled the most pro-equality president in history. I’m not sure that’s true, but I’ll tell you what, I’m grateful to lead an administration with more out and proud staff members at every level than every previous administration combined. All combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "(08:56)\n",
      "Together with all of you, my administration is defending, advancing equal human rights to the LGBTQ community, all across the country and I mean it, and around the world. I’m proud of our record. I signed historic executive orders [inaudible 00:09:10] civil rights protections in housing, employment, healthcare, education, the justice system.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:16)\n",
      "As Commander-in-Chief, I ended the ban on transgender Americans serving in the military. As I pointed out, they can shoot as straight as anybody else I know.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:29)\n",
      "On the anniversary of the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, the Department of Defense announced the review of the records of LGBTQ service members who have been discharged for less than honorable service, which is going to make it easy for those veterans to finally access the benefits they earned through their service.\n",
      "\n",
      "(09:50)\n",
      "We launched an ambitious plan to end HI epidemic by 2030, proposed a new national PrEP program to prevent the spread of HIV, and we finally did away with the outdated policy banning gay and bisexuals from donating blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:16)\n",
      "Leading with science, not stigma, we made human rights for LGBT around the world a top priority in my foreign policy, increasing our assistance to brave activists on the ground, defending human rights in countries that passed anti-gay laws like Uganda, going after Uganda, making clear that they cannot get the same benefits as other countries, and achieving tangible progress [inaudible 00:10:44].\n",
      "\n",
      "(10:44)\n",
      "Look, folks, here’s the deal, together, we’re standing up for families, some of you were with us on the South Lawn last December when I signed the Respect For Marriage Act, a law protecting the marriage of gay interracial couples. As I said in a TV interview more than a decade ago, marriage is a simple proposition, who do you love? Will you be loyal to the person you love?\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:15)\n",
      "I was raised in that was quite a simple proposition. I’ve told the story before, but I’m telling it again. I was raised by a man who was a really decent, honorable man. I remember he was dropping me off, I wanted to work in the projects as a lifeguard on the east side of Wilmington, and he was dropping me off on his way to work at the City Hall to go get an application to be a lifeguard there.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:39)\n",
      "As I got out of the car, at the four corners in the center of town, two men, turns out one going to the Brandywine, one worked for the DuPont company, the other worked for [inaudible 00:11:53] company. This is back when I was a kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "(11:55)\n",
      "They leaned up and kissed one another. I never seen that before. I turned and looked at my dad, and he just looked at me and he said, “Joey, it’s simple. It’s simple, Joey. They love one another.” It’s a simple proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:07)\n",
      "I mean it. To everyone who helped make the Respect For Marriage Act a reality, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Together, we’re standing up for children. As you know better than anyone, there are young people all across America sitting in their bedrooms at night, scrolling through social media, and staring at the ceiling wondering will they ever be loved? What happens if they tell their parents? What’s going to go on?\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:35)\n",
      "Many of you have been through it. Will they be ever accepted by their families? Ever be free to be themselves? Whether they should even be there or here on Earth?\n",
      "\n",
      "(12:46)\n",
      "Nearly every day, I get letters, literally, from children and parents terrified by what’s happening all across America. A 13 year old transgender child wrote to me and said, “I hate looking at the news, not because I’m a teenager and it’s boring but because it’s painful. I hear adults, much older than me, debate about my existence when they don’t even know me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:15)\n",
      "Our message to young people across America must be unequivocal, you’re loved, you’re heard, and you’re understood, and you belong. I mean it. We see who you are, made in the image of God, deserving dignity and respect and support. That’s why my administration combating the dangerous, cruel practice of conversion therapy has been so outspoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:44)\n",
      "That’s why we launched the nationwide prejudice hotline where LGBTQ youth who are feeling isolated and overwhelmed can get help. They just have to call 988, and talk to a counselor. 988, and talk to a counselor.\n",
      "\n",
      "(13:59)\n",
      "This year, we’re committing even more resources, new federal action to address LGBTQ youth homelessness, new steps to protect kids in foster care. All of it matters, but for all the progress we’ve made, we know the barriers, the bias, the bigotry still exists. Perhaps because of the progress we’ve made, people want to push us back and pull us back.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:25)\n",
      "Over 600 hateful laws introduced across the country, more than 70 of them becoming law just this last year, denying the existence of transgender people, silencing teachers, banning books, threatening parents with prison for getting their children healthcare. Families across the country now face excruciating decisions to move to a different state to protect their child from the dangerous anti-LGBTQ laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "(14:57)\n",
      "I received a letter from one mom who wrote me, “I despair for families like mine, who will already become refugees inside our nation.” Refugees inside our nation? That’s how she feels, like a refugee inside our nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:15)\n",
      "This is the United States of America, and the United States Congress extreme MAGA Republicans trying to undo virtually every bit of progress we’ve made. They’re trying to wipe out federal funding to end the HIV epidemic, strip funding from community centers for seniors, reinstate the ban on transgender troops, ban the Department of Justice from enforcing civil rights laws, ban Pride flags from flying on public lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "(15:43)\n",
      "Who the hell … Oh. Not very presidential. They threaten the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. These are just the cruel attacks on LGBT community. They’re attacks on the foundations of our democracy. They take aim at our fundamental values and principles, like the right to free expression, the right to make our own healthcare decisions, the right to raise our own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:21)\n",
      "I’m never going to stand by and watch families terrorize doctors and nurses, criminalize, or any child targeted for who they are. It’s who they are. Jill and I, Kamala, Doug, and our entire administration will always stand with you against hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:40)\n",
      "Together, we’re going to make even more progress. You’ve heard me say before, and I apologize for having to repeat it, when a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still fundamentally wrong in this country. That still exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "(16:58)\n",
      "That’s why we must pass the Equality Act, and pass it now. That’s what we must do. At a time when studies show violence against LGBTQ Americans is on the rise, we have to do more to keep people in the community safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(17:20)\n",
      "25 years ago this week, Matthew Shepard was brutally taken from us. His courageous parents Judy and Dennis have turned his murder into a movement. As we remember him, we also remember the LGBTQ people and allies killed this year, like O’Shae Sibley, killed while dancing and expressing joy, Laura Ann Carleton, who simply hung a Pride flag outside of her … Think of that, she hung a Pride flag outside her home. She was killed. Colin Smith stabbed while defending a friend, and dozens of transgender Americans, especially transgender women of color killed every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:09)\n",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Health and Human Services has launched a safety partnership to better protect festivals and marches and community centers and businesses, to better protect healthcare providers serving the community, and to help folks report hate crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "(18:25)\n",
      "Nearly a year after the horrific shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs, we have to fully implement the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, and then pass again the assault weapons ban, which Diane and I passed. No excuse. Who in God’s name needs a weapon with 100 rounds in the chamber? The weapon is only meant for one thing, to kill people. We did it before. We can do it again. As long as I’m in office, I’m not going to stop until we get it done again.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:04)\n",
      "Look, folks, let me close with this, a week ago, we saw hate manifest in another way, in the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. More than 1300 innocent lives lost in Israel, including, at least, 27 Americans. Children, and grandparents alike, kidnapped, held hostage by Hamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:25)\n",
      "The humanitarian crisis in Gaza, innocent Palestinian families and a vast majority who have nothing to do with Hamas, they’re being used as human shield. Yesterday, I spoke for over an hour with a family member of those Americans who are still unaccounted for, on a Zoom call. They’ve endured an agony of not knowing what’s happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "(19:52)\n",
      "Not the same thing, but I can tell you what it’s like, it’s one thing to lose someone and you know you’re going to lose them and be there with them and hold their hands, like I was able to do with my son. It’s a very other thing to get a phone call, that I got years ago saying, “There’s been an accident. Your wife and daughter are dead. I’m not sure your boys are going to make it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(20:15)\n",
      "The uncertainty, those two or three hours, trying to get back to find out. It’s the worst feeling in the world. It’s gut-wrenching. It’s yet another reminder that hate never goes away. It only hides. It hides under the rocks. I thought being so deeply involved in the civil rights movement when I was able to convince of all people, Strom Thurmond to vote for the Voting Rights Act in his last year, change his mind. I thought, “Well, you can defeat hate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(20:52)\n",
      "Guess what happened? Hate just hides under the rocks until there’s a little oxygen blown under, like what happened in Charlottesville, just a little bit, and it comes roaring out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "(21:08)\n",
      "Folks, we have to reject hate in every form, because history has taught us, again and again, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, they’re all connected. Hate toward one group left unanswered opens the door for more hate toward more groups more often readily.\n",
      "\n",
      "(21:30)\n",
      "Here’s what we [inaudible 00:21:32] the antidote to hate is love. The answer to [inaudible 00:21:37] is solidarity, and standing up for everyone in humanity. That’s why the laws that actually protect equality matter. Every single American, no matter who you are, who you love, or where you come from, this shouldn’t be about conservative/liberal, red or blue. It should be about realizing the promise of the Declaration of Independence. It sounds corny, but a promise rooted in the sacred and the secular, that all people are created equal, and [inaudible 00:22:02] created with certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:09)\n",
      "Folks, it may sound corny but we never fully lived up to that promise, but we never walked away from it like many want us to do, and we’re not going to walk away from it on my watch, I promise you.\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:21)\n",
      "All of you here tonight, and all the advocates and allies across the country, I see the light that’s going to triumph over the darkness. I see the hope that’s going to conquer fear. I see the love that’s going to overcome hate in all its forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:35)\n",
      "I see a great nation, because we’re, basically, a good people. We just have to remember who we are, and we’re not the victim and, although, we’re good folks, we got to stand up and holler. We got to stand up and holler. You cannot be silent. Silence is complicity. Silence is complicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "(22:53)\n",
      "Folks, we’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Nothing, nothing, nothing, so let’s stand together and get everyone else on the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "(23:07)\n",
      "God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n",

      "I’m saying we’re gonna do everything in our power to find those who are still alive and set them free. Everything in our power. I’m not gonna go into the detail of that, but we’re working like hell on it.\n",

      "\n",
      "President Biden (01:21):\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I think they have to know that the President of the United States of America cares deeply about what’s happening. Deeply. We have to communicate to the world this is critical. This is not even human behavior. It’s pure barbarism. And we’re gonna do everything in our power to get them home if we can find them.\n",

For example, in Ukraine one of my objectives was to prevent Putin, who has committed war crimes himself from being able to occupy an independent country that borders NATO allies and is on the Russian border. Imagine what happens now if he were able to succeed. Have you ever known a major war in Europe we didn’t get sucked into? We don’t want that to happen.

This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue. To protect our rights, to make sure that everyone in this country is treated equally and that everyone is given a fair shot at making it. But you know, around the country, MAGA extremists are lining up to take on those bedrock freedoms, cutting social security that you’ve paid for your entire life, while cutting taxes from the very wealthy, dictating what healthcare decisions women can make, banning books and telling people who they can love all while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.\n",

      "When I ran for president four years ago, I said, “We’re in a battle for the soul of America,” and we still are. The question we’re facing is whether in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights are fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too. This is not a time to be complacent. That’s why I’m running for reelection; because I know America. I know we’re good and decent people. I know we’re still a country that believes in honesty and respect, in treating each other with dignity. That we’re a nation where we give hate no safe harbor. We believe that everyone is equal, that everyone should be given a fair shot to succeed in this country. Thank you for choosing us.\n",
