Hitler - Satz239: "not only are they important in the sphere of social policy but also, and even more so, in the national political sphere, for, when the great messes of a nation see their vital needs satisfied through a just trade-unionist movement, which is at the same time educating them, the stamina of the whole nation in its struggle for existence will be enormously reinforced thereby."
Biden - Satz29: "that’s how it’s sold by voices that seek to fan the flames of social division and political polarization, and perhaps most importantly and most worrying of all, by increasing the dissatisfaction of people all around the world with democratic governments that they feel are failing to deliver for their needs."

Hitler - Satz81: "the refusal of the social democrats, to improve the miserable living conditions of the working classes, ought to have induced the bourgeois parties to make the most energetic efforts in this direction and to snatch from the hands of the class-warfare leaders their most precious weapon; but nothing of this kind happened."
Biden - Satz29: "that’s how it’s sold by voices that seek to fan the flames of social division and political polarization, and perhaps most importantly and most worrying of all, by increasing the dissatisfaction of people all around the world with democratic governments that they feel are failing to deliver for their needs."

Hitler - Satz313: "it would be senseless to have a national socialist trade, union side by side with other trade-unions, for the former must be thoroughly imbued with a feeling for the ideological nature of its task and the resulting obligation not to tolerate other similar or hostile institutions."

Hitler - Satz84: "we national socialists, on the other hand, have every reason for attempting not only to establish the opposition of those individual states on the basis of a constitutional force which promises to be successful, but to make their struggle against centralisation as a whole the expression of higher national german interests in a wide sense."
Biden - Satz29: "that’s how it’s sold by voices that seek to fan the flames of social division and political polarization, and perhaps most importantly and most worrying of all, by increasing the dissatisfaction of people all around the world with democratic governments that they feel are failing to deliver for their needs."
