Hitler - Satz39: "if the german trade-unions had defended the interests of the working- classes uncompromisingly during the war; - if, even during the war, they had used the weapon of the strike to force the industrialists (who were greedy for higher dividends) to grant the demands of the workers for whom the unions acted; - if at the same time they had stood up as good germans for the defence of the nation as stoutly as for their own claims; and - if they had given as unstintedly to their country that which was their country’s due—then the war would never have been lost."
Obama - Satz35: "to overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend, because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of america."
