Hitler - Satz8: "that its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the working classes (which, in my ignorance, i then foolishly believed) was a further point in favour of social democracy rather than against it,) but the feature that contributed most to estrange me from the social democratic movement was its hostile attitude towards the struggle for the preservation of germanism in austria and its undignified wooing of the slav ‘comrades,’ who received these approaches favourably as long as any, practical advantages  were forthcoming, but otherwise maintained a haughty reserve, thus giving the suitors the answer their behaviour deserved."
Bush - Satz66: "honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of washington."
