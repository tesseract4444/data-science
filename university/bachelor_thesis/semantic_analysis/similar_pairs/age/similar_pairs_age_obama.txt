Hitler - Satz150: "not only were the active assault formations that had started the revolution dissatisfied and, feeling that they had been betrayed, eager to continue the fight on their own account, but their unchecked racketeering was even approved by the wire-pullers of the revolution, for the revolution itself had scarcely been accomplished when it appeared to be divided into two camps."
Obama - Satz345: "but what is absolutely true is that with all that stuff coming at folks fast and furious -- a recovery package, what we had to do with respect to the banks, what we had to do with respect to the auto companies -- i think people started looking at all this and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people’s lives than they were accustomed to."
