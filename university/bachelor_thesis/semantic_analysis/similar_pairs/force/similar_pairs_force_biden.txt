Hitler - Satz260: "the feeling which had induced those few young people to join in what seemed such a ridiculous enterprise was nothing but the call of the inner voice which told them—though more intuitively than consciously—that the whole party system as it had hitherto existed was not the kind of force that could restore the german nation or repair the damage that had been done to the german people by those who had hitherto controlled the internal affairs of the nation."
