POS	5.0	 I upgraded from some speakers I purchased when I built my system. The sound difference was wonderful. It is a clean crisp fresh sound. Worth every penny
POS	4.0	 Pros: Great battery life Compact, but not too small No extra dongle Cons: Included software is worthless, but you don't really need to use it $40 is a bit much considering that you can get cordless keyboard/mouse sets for around $30 nowaday
POS	5.0	 Okay so it was about 8:45 at night. I was coming on to a 1/2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where I live. I was doing 60mph, the speed limit is 40. As I start to approach the bridge I start getting a small K-Band warning. I instantly slow down to the speed limit. As I start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so I slow down even more to 35 mph. Then it gets to full K-Band. I look to my left where there is a service parking area, and in the pitch dark I see the reflectors of the one and only Crown Vic Police Car. As I pass the police car, I start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead. If I didn't have this detector he would have gotten me doing 20 over the limit. Thank you Escort!
POS	5.0	 This is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I'm not maniac driver. The detection range is very good, it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won't help much, I have it turned off. Overall, it's very good detector, you will get payback if you own one.
POS	5.0	 The best headphones I ever had, good fit excellent sound on my SoundBlaster X-FI!!
POS	4.0	 I got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below (followed exactly). There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work. Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender. Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5, this is what worked for me at any rate. I've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised. I gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain. From S Huff: The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working... but I still had some issues. I've added onto his tips from his review below 1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP 2-Hold the auto-configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 10-15 secs. 3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander), a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). 4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired & save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) 5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. 5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. 6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. 7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you're DONE. Enjoy
POS	5.0	 Works with Ipod skin,no need to take off cover.Looks good.Has connections for Audio,TV. Cables and remote are additional. Included are 5 adapters for all Ipods that have doc connector. Paid 29.95 from Amazon including shipping.It is what it is.It's a dock
POS	5.0	 This is a great storage device. I use it to store documents to take with me when I travel and I keep it in my purse. I love the lanyard, that helps me to keep track of the drive. Worth every $$$ I paid for it!
POS	4.0	 This is a very nice set of paper and envelopes. The price is really great. The paper is a little lighter than the ones that cost almost double. The colors come out very bright and the folding is easy. Overall it is a good deal
POS	5.0	 I have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them. I had purchased this one to replace my 2.4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer. This one doesn't. I also like the feature of the intercom feature. My daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she isn't on the phone, I can contact her to talk to her. My daughter also likes the mute feature where she can put somebody on hold if she is on the phone to ask me a question so that person on the other end doesn't hear her. The phone has many other features but those are 2 usefule ones I like along with the caller ID
POS	5.0	 I am extremely pleased with the purchase. I am using it in my office. Simple plug and play (no brainer)!! If I get the MIR the cost comes to $5. None can better that. Transaction with Amazon was flawless as usual
POS	5.0	 Like most other reviews, I will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings. What helped me is when I looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in. Now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit. Movies are amazing! My music collection never sounded so good. If you want to get away from it all for awhile, slip these babies in your ears and chill
POS	5.0	 I bought USB rudder pedals and yoke for use with X-Plane on a Mac Dual G5. Plug and play (no drivers needed), easily configured in x-plane, works beautifully. Great price! Thanks Amazon! Shipping was 2 days early! Kudos to Fedex! I am a private pilot, and recommend this product
POS	4.0	 I needed a simple solution for my office. I wanted to be able to use the phone, but not get tied down by the handset, or the headset. Here was my solution, Since the TS105B has the 2.5mm port for a headset, I purchased a Jabra A210 Bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office. So far... WOW!!! its worked out great. The phone is also good by itself, plus it was inexpensive through AMAZON. For anyone interested in going the route I took... you will not be disappointed. Oh yes... you are limited to about 25 ft, or in my case as I work in a hospital where there are alot of other signals and lead lined walls... 15ft with max length at about 20 before you begin to hear static. The phone was a great buy, as was the Jabra A210 adapter.
POS	5.0	 I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing "Bourne Supremecy" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy. As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product
POS	4.0	 There is a little story before this: I bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50. On with the review: Yes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue. It also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good!). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort. If your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn't too loud & I can live with it. I reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer
POS	4.0	 This does what it's advertized too. I like not having wires. The iPod in my bag, and just the headset. It would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset, ie turn off the headset, receiver and ipod all from the headset. Instead, I have to get the ipod back out, turn it off, turn the receiver off, then turn the headset off. Otherwise, the sound is good and the headset hasn't broken for me yet
POS	4.0	 I picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight). Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses). Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding. My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650. 1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones)
POS	5.0	 I am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from Case Logic. This is a great product and is manufactured well. Holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out. I don't transport them so I can't comment on that. Like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up. Get this if you need a lot of storage
POS	5.0	 This headphone extension is perfect! It is not as long as described (about 15 feet) but that's O.K. with me. The connections are tight (the plugs don't pull apart). It maintains sonic quality. It also retains it's elasticity. Using this extension cord my Grado SR-60's sound better than any wireless phones. You won't be dissapointed!
POS	5.0	 This is a pretty decent cheapo case. If you want something that you'll use every day in the car or at your DJ gigs, then you may want to get something a little sturdier. For my [archival] purposes, however, it works just fine
POS	5.0	 Purchase/Service: For $2,200 at Amazon, this was a great purchase since it would have cost over $2,700 at a retail store (including tax and shipping). Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate, unloaded the TV right to the TV stand, and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked, I signed for it. And, Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away. Very pleased with the service part so far..... My Set-up: S6187 61" HDTV Sony AV and 5.1 surround (this is not a digital unit.....I wasn't sure it would work but there are three options to hook-up a home theater: 1) Basic connection; 2) Optical; 3) HDMI) Sony DVD Motorola HD-CATV box (We use Comcast) Sony VCR Experience: As far as the tv, the HD channels look sharp and clear, however the non HD channels aren't as sharp as my 36" Sony CRT TV (there are several settings on the Samsung for 16:9, 4:3 and wide format; setting to 4:3 or wide for non HD channels improves the picture quality a little). But it doesn't effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away. The TV controls are simple to use, and the on screen menu's are easy to navigate. The sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound, but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life. I like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV, so there is room for 3 additional components with my set-up. I also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV). After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users), it was incredible! The camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV, so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall. It was a simple set-up, and again, the picture quality just blew me away!!! I highly recommend this TV to anyome looking for a 50" plus TV
POS	5.0	 The ink toner I received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion.
POS	4.0	 A very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer. The reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently
POS	5.0	 This was by far the easiest computer peripheral I have ever setup! Works flawlessly with my Netgear wireless router
POS	4.0	 It is remarkable that, even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence, none of them are near-perfect. I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use. The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone. The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen. In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection. Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching. The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case. The most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling. Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel. The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off. It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case. Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases. Unfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available. I couldn't find it in any store, and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers. I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days. Whatever you do, don't order from the iSkin company directly. I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases. They should re-dedicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them
POS	5.0	 Ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days. Love the service at Amazon
POS	5.0	 These are the BEST. PERIOD! Look no further.. because you will not find a better value in rechargable batteries
POS	5.0	 i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations. it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes. after 3 conversations with canon customer care, we decided it was not the printer, but the cheaper ink. i switched back to canon, bit the bullet on the price, and everything is fine. i found decent prices on amazon, particularly at eek industries
POS	4.0	 this is a nifty very small musical device that I use when exercising. its great - holds all the songs I can listen to and is so portable. I really like i
POS	5.0	 I was so happy with my Creative Zen Nano that I bought one as a gift. I love the color choice and the sound is great. Love the pause button. It came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band. You do not need to buy one!! Amazon delivered it in 2 days
POS	5.0	 This printer was purchased for my wife's birthday and arrived in two to three days. Considering money spent the printer works quite well. Pictures come out very good overall. An HP 95 or HP 97 cartridge is used for color photos. It contains three color inks but no black. Still, photos will easily satisfy the average owner. An HP 100 cartridge can be used for black and white photos. Yes, the color cartridge must be exchanged for the black one when converting from color to black and white and vise versa. Even so, we find the printer fun and very simple to use. Just keep in mind that the price of ink will soon exceed the price of the printer if used often. What we do is use it for special occasions or when the grandchildren come over. Gary
POS	4.0	 This is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality
POS	4.0	 I'm using Monster optical cable as well, but with different reasons behind. Anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or EMF
POS	5.0	 Sound quality is very good, and I haven't run out of battery so far. The base is somewhat smaller than what I expected from the pictures. The handsets are well designed; on my previous phone it happened that the "mute" function became engaged when I kept the phone between my head and my shoulders - this did not happen with these so far. Speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages. Answering machine works well. Easy to copy phonebook entries between phones.
POS	5.0	 This does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is light, easy to pack, easy to use, and probably difficult to crack. (Though would-be PC pilferers haven't tried taking a hacksaw to my cable lock so I cannot comment as to its ability to withstand saws, blow-torches, or any other criminal's tool.) Other reviewers baffled me as mine is as described by Amazon. There is neither an alarm nor batteries. Why bother with an alarm if the PC is locked with steel cable? Seems like overkill
POS	5.0	 I tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. So, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven't used so far. Although I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a "USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far. The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing. The Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet. All in all - for webcams, I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I've generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech. 
POS	4.0	 Easy to operate and good focus. Just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam
POS	4.0	 Garmin iQue M5 I'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA. While it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more. With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue. With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth. It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas. It's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence. We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare. I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software. The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course. You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated. This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out. I used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater. Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The "Route to Home" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're "directionally challenged" like I am, it becomes indispensible. The car mounting bracket works fine. It's popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle. The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car. I've spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful. The PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do. It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games. I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost). It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists. You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos. I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day. No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod. Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn't that intuitive, once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs. We've called Garmin Tech Support a few times and, although they are only open during regular business hours, we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product. Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...] We've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won't wear out too quickly, as I've heard Palm Pilots tend to do. I'm really enjoying the iQue. 
POS	4.0	 We bought this about a month ago from Amazon. The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back. At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route). However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route. Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile. We liked that it is a PDA though. My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it. This way, when he has to wait around, he will have something to do. CONS: - You should be tech-savvy to get one of these set up - Match sure you get patches as unit will lock up - Manufacturer has DISCONTINUED this model. They still offer some support but be warned that this is a DISCONTINUED model. - Since it became DISCONTINUED, it dropped in price about $60 two weeks after I bought it which annoys me somewhat - Will be spending extra to get bigger memory card - Came with EXPIRED Outlook coupon - why bother including this? PROS - Nice display and controls - Came with mount and dock (some don't - you have to buy extra) - We had no trouble with the suction cup mount (had to pry it off the window with a knife one time) but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield - Also a PD
POS	5.0	 This phone was an additional phone for the Model IP811-2 phone system used for Vonage. This system has every feature that I could want, including range and quality, there are no negatives. I am highly recommending this phone and system
POS	5.0	 Not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod. The unit is not perfect, it does freeze occasionally, but the re-set function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions. Sound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and you'll love it. This is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player, Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3, quit working the week the warranty ran out. Thumbs up on this one
POS	4.0	 I purchased this cable solely to connect my GPSmap 76S to my HP laptop. So far it has performed perfectly. I have not tried to use it for other applications yet, so I can't comment on how well it would work in other situations.
POS	5.0	 I find this printer to be better than HP or Epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles, just a solid printer that performs as I anticipated
POS	5.0	 The zen micro is brilliant I have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice, i've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect. I had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better. It is very easy to transfer files to it I always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software. I use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me. Overall the zen micro is a very good product
POS	5.0	 I bought four of these. So far they appear to work well. They do not work with compact flourescent lights well, but are fine with incandescent bulbs
POS	5.0	 I bought this screen as a replacement for my 8ms 17" Hyundai L90D+(which is a great low-priced screen for gaming), which was the replacement for a Dell fp2100 (that I gave to my wife). Anyways, this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times (more than enough for my flight sims). Movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution hasn't been a problem. The design is probably the neatest looking out there (subjective I realize). The ONLY gripe I have w/ this monitor is lack of swivel (sigh). Other than that I'm very pleased with everything about this screen
POS	5.0	 Wow...just got one of these at a great price, hooked it up to my Mac G4 via a DVID cable, and it boots up at native resolution (1680 x 1050) automatically - no muss, no fuss. Text is crisp and clean
POS	5.0	 My favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers (1-xxx-xxx-xxxx) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call. My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxx-xxx-xxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first. This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number. I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in. Very handy. As far as being a phone, it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it
POS	5.0	 This is the rockinest think i've ever seen or buyed dudes!!! check it ou
POS	4.0	 This is my first GPS and I wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking, hiking, kayaking, and in the car to. I found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls. Also the 2 times I called Garmin with questions I was able to talk to someone who is in the USA as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some. On the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
POS	5.0	 Ok.. here's the deal. I've been an avid Magellan user for the past 3 years. I love my Magellan. I've never liked the Garmins because of their clumsy interface (the buttons placed above the display NEVER made sense to me) and how the menu structure was built. However.... We're planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast. We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time. My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day. I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me, it was torture). I could go on and on about why I sent it back. What I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx. Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side. I couldn't be happier with my decision. While I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps, and the expense of additional ones, this unit ROCKS! It acquires satellites within seconds. It has expandable memory. It has a color screen. It manages Geocaches. It auto-routes. It stores 1000 waypoints. It has SiRF Technology. It is a USB interface. It has a belt clip. It changes display contrast at night (automatically). It slices... It dices.... Suddenly the Dark Side isn't so dark!! This is a great unit that I would recommend to anyone.
POS	4.0	 I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is. I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned. Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player. Like many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use. After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long. The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge. Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues. I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual. I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). It came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live). Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space. About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months. I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more. As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well. The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel. Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot. I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player. It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option. I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results. The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer. It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer. As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list. I don't know what caused this. Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying. Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre. It came with a headset, but I have never used it. Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it. I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge. Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen. I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable. It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics. Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod
POS	4.0	 Pros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small Cons: Stopped working, froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. But overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it
POS	5.0	 I've never written a review, but I've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers, so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review. I know experience and taste vary by individual, but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint. Pros: - Bluetooth - connects immediately; provides smooth accurate tracking - Size - very portable; some may find it too narrow; I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse - Battery life - I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I'm a fairly heavy user - USB charge attachment - allows you to continue to work while recharging - Product Design/Quality - Nicely engineered; good quality material- not tinny - it's built to take abuse Cons: - Haven't really found any - It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line (I don't tend to do that) then I realized it was pretty straight forward. If you're looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one.
POS	5.0	 I was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer. The photo output is awesome and it's very fast! There are only two things I would comment on that new users might not be aware of. I was ready to return the printer as I thought it was defective until I found out what the problems were. 1) When the cartridges dry out, it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible. This was confusing as I did have the correct cartridges in the printer. A "replace cartridge" message would have been less ambiguous. 2) The printer has so far appeared "dead" once. When I went to turn it on, it would not do so. The solution is on HP's website - you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset. I did this and the printer worked fine again. The printer does not come with a USB cable, but those can be easily bought for $14-20.
POS	5.0	 I'm a skeptic. No, I mean I'm REALLY a skeptic... especially in today's marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don't buy anything without checking it out first, and even then, I expect that it's probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah, wonderful view there, huh? Well, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn't fail me out of the box. I've been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that's how well this gamepad has worked for me. Here are the ins and outs: 1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally "sturdy as hell". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department. 2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all. I've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job. 4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just "excercising" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I've never had it happen since. 5) Other buttons. * The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). * The orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default "map" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button. * I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that's not much of a complaint at all, really. The d-pad itself is a godsend! I'm a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. As I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed - a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn't it? The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for the type of benefits I've listed. And, for that matter, I'm recommending it right now in fact...
POS	4.0	 The sound of these earbuds are great..and they are a value for the price. However the "in the ear" design causes them to catch sweat, and they won't last when you sweat into them alot. After 9-12 months of wearing them in the GYM they will stop working. I have gone through 3 pairs in the last 2 years
POS	5.0	 Using this Kingston chip on my Pearl 8100 phone and it has worked flawlessly. And eSmartBuy delivered it within about 3 days of my order. Can't beat that
POS	5.0	 I work in a computer lab where we constantly re-image devices (using Norton Ghost). I have 3 laptops and 1 DELL GX620 desktop and all of them have Gigabit connection. When I connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous, I get the same performance (0 differences) as I run 1 laptop to the GX620. This testing was done with Cat5 cables that I pick randomly from my lab. I can't wait to add more devices and using Cat6 cables to get my work done faster
POS	4.0	 The antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the GPS units internal antenna. This easily solved the issue of poor reception when the GPS is inside of a car; however, the best accuracy I am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs. the 9 feet using the GPS's internal antenna when in an open area. Garmin's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around (on my GPS). I feel the antenna was worth purchasing
POS	4.0	 I use the Suctions Mount Antenna because I remove from sight whenever I leave my car which is idea for my purposes. The antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock. The only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up
POS	4.0	 this unit has a/v in. my thought was that one could play video games on it, or view images from a camcorder/digital camera. however, all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen. so it does not allow me to do all i wanted. it is also a bit on the loud side. if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit. i got one of those also, and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor. it also does not make much noise
POS	5.0	 This is a great swicth with low price. I use it together with D-Link DI-704 4-port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 PC, two servers, one PowerMac and a laptop connected to cable modem ISP. Connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesn't show any noticeable slow-response as compared to connecting via the router directly. It works well by itself as we as with D-Link DI-704
POS	5.0	 I would highly recommend this phone set. Easy to program and crystal clear reception. A definite 5 star
POS	5.0	 Works well with Canon 10D, 30D, and S40. Fairly fast write speed. And 4GB - pretty big (1600 JPGs in the 30D!)
POS	5.0	 For the Epson Photo 1270, the photo quality and color are excellent. I have printed digital photos that people cannot believe come from an inkjet printer
POS	5.0	 This product was very easy to set-up. Hooked up 4 computers and had all up and running in no time. Been running 3 months with NO problems what so ever. Would highly recommend
POS	5.0	 I am amazed by the quality of the guitar. The product is extremely good. The service by amazon was ultimate. Thanks a lot Amazon
POS	4.0	 Since there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs, I recommend you get this one. Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case. Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry. It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use. The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases. The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned). The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality. The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there. A solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
POS	5.0	 This is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers. You don't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming! Excellent travel accessory
POS	5.0	 Works exactly as advertised - I travel a lot and I can finally enjoy those long travel hours in planes calmly. Worth the "relatively" high price tag
POS	4.0	 Unit's range shorter than expected, but I feel that I got what I wanted, and paid for. Shipping and delivery were great
POS	5.0	 I was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both!! It's very easy to learn and enter stuff. I'm a first time PDA owner and this is an excellent product!
POS	5.0	 If you ORIGINALLY & NEWLY unlocked a NEW locked MapSource CD-ROM/DVD-ROM product ON or AFTER the release date of an update for that same product, you are eligible to unlock on that specific update what you unlocked on the original for no charge. In other words, you can update to the latest data for free! visit the garmin web site for more inf
POS	4.0	 If you're looking for isolation from ambient noise, these are great. I use them as In Ear Monitors for my onstage use (rock band), and if I use the foam inserts, I can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off. I've read some people complain that the bass response is not quite what they expected, but frankly it doesn't bother me a bit. The only thing that's awkward is removing them when they're fully inserted for a while. They're rather small, and getting hold of them can be a bit tricky. I'm using small bits of tape for "pull tabs", and it seems to work pretty well. Overall, I'm impressed with this product since it's affordable and does exactly what it's advertised to do
POS	4.0	 I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous. I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so! I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move. Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though. Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun
POS	5.0	 The phone works great!. I have three of these and a base. The best phones I have had. The other phones I have are the TCX800 model (previous version), equally good. I had trouble deregistering one of the phones, as it has to be close to the original base (kept telling me out of range). I found out that pressing END and #, also deregisters
POS	5.0	 I just use the keyboard like a business user. I don't use the media stuff. I really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works. I like that it's not huge and doesn't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that I never use. The rechargeable mouse is handy as well. Prior to this, I had two Microsoft wireless combos in a row, and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me. I don't know if it's because it's Logitech or it's bluetooth, but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired (after they "wake up").
POS	5.0	 I used the Tripp lite to charge my PowerBook and digital camera during a cross country trip to grad school. It worked great and I had no problems. The only thing I could have used was a second outlet
POS	5.0	 Esactly what I was wanting. When you turn there is resistance (springs I think) and everything works great. If you use flight sims you need this product. Works awsome
POS	5.0	 nicely designed leather case w/ belt clip. i bought this for my hp hx2415. pockets good for SD memory cards. belt clip hooks very tightly to belt, so you don't have to worry about dropping pda.
POS	5.0	 Este estuche lo compr para mi iPaq hx2415 y es muy cmodo de llevar porque no es grande y adems el equipo se mantiene seguro por el diseo que tiene
POS	5.0	 This backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my MacBook safe. Its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything I need. As a chronically disorganized person, the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings. The strap is nicely padded and it's elastic, so shocks are well absorbed. A nice touch is a zippered 'cavity' at the top, which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger. The build quality seems excellent so far - it looks to be a very durable product. I've always had good luck with Wenger products in the past. The best part about this backpack is that it doesn't scream 'There's a computer in here!'.
POS	4.0	 Great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school. It has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it. One of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes
POS	4.0	 Great sound quality; great signal quality. I can hear everyone well, and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well. The main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger, with a couple walls in between, and I have no problems with signal. The handsets are smaller than I expected, but that's actually a bonus since I hadn't bought a new phone in a while and thought my old handset was too big and clunky. The handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part, 1 and 7/8 inches at the widest point by the display, and 1 and 1/8 inches thick at the thickest point. Doesn't interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics. I've used the phone while sitting next to my laptop, while both I and the chargers were next to TV and stereos, and with my cell phone going at the same time - no interference. The speakerphone part isn't that great - the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room, plus they say it sounds like I'm speaking from a great distance away. But I've never had a phone with a good speakerphone, so wasn't expecting that to work anyway. Would have been great if they'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks. I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet - solved my lack of working jacks problem!! The display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys. The keys are not backlit. The menus are fairly intuitive - if you've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily. It's very easy to send phone numbers that you've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset. When I first hooked everything up, the phones got no dial tone, but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall. For some reason, the cord they provided didn't work, so when I swapped it out with the cord I had, all the phones worked fine. I'd buy these again and recommend to others to buy
POS	5.0	 This is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands. It is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely, even if you are left-handed. The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse. I can't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one
POS	5.0	 PROS: xlnt quality long cord usb or ps2 connection xlnt accuracy very comfortable feel easy access to side buttons great gaming mouse affordable CONS: none this is by far the best mouse i've ever owned bar none
POS	5.0	 I love it. You can switch back and forth from left hand to right hand and it was a great price
POS	5.0	 This is an excellent product. If you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you. I am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day. I have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places. The Garmin GPS 18 plugs right into the USB port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments. I'll admit "NROUTE" took a little getting used to (for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you're not going to find it) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie. Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations. A great buy for only 100 bucks! If you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of GPS, dont spend $500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome GPS sensor for only $100
POS	5.0	 Obviously, there are far better printers on the market. But if you're looking for a quality 3-in-one in the $100 to $150 range, this one seems to be at the top of the pack. There are nicer printers out there in this price range. However, you will be severely penalized when it comes to purchasing ink. Hewlett-Packard printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges. It prints fast, it prints well, and I enjoy the double-sided printing feature. This printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints, although I've done little color printing myself. The scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in Photoshop. The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels. They're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won't see them unless you're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably. Still, it's probably not the best for archiving your photos. (I expect there's a bur on the plastic gear that rolls down the rack & pinion) However, flaws are to be expected in this price range and the listed flaws of this printer are nominal. Given my research two months ago, and performance I've encountered after purchasing this printer, and the ease with which I was able to refill the ink cartridges; I'd say this is the best printer you can buy for $100,(as of Nov 2006) if you don't want to be extorted into paying exorbitant ink prices, for say, an Epson
POS	5.0	 Since I've seen musicians use JBL speakers for their concerts, that gave me a trust in their product. With that, I became an owner to a desktop JBL pc cpeaker. This product has been satisfactory and by far I have no complaints from it
POS	5.0	 Note: This is a review of the Targus PA225U Retractable Phone & Ethernet Cord (Plastic Casing). It's the rectangular model, not the oval shaped one. I'm on the road 50-75% of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip. I initially bought it because I forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly. I like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so I can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet. I've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems. I've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction
POS	5.0	 This is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot. If I leave my laptop somewhere I hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad. This is really small and compact! Perfect for traveling too. I've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem...it still recoils well
POS	5.0	 I just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup. I had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck. However, with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear. It is so small and just excellent. Great work, Logitech
POS	5.0	 I have the Canon MP500 printer and Canon Rebel XT camera - both capable of producing amazing results, but paper makes a HUUUUGE diference in photo printing. I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. Pros: Best Value Canon has to offer. Great, great prints, my favorite paper overall. As good as Pro, and less expensive. About 55 cents per page in a 30 page pack of Pro compared to 40 cents per page in a 20 page pack of Plus. Cons: None at all so far. have not seen if photos last over time
POS	5.0	 I tested my new Canon i960 with a variety of papers. Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive &quot;Pro&quot; paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the &quot;Pro&quot; paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)
POS	4.0	 I've had this for at least 8 months now. We've used it with xD, sD, Memory Stick Pro, Pro Duo(with the adapter) and a few misc. cards that friends' cameras may be using. I've never had a problem getting cards in or out, nor any problems with reading the data on them. My only possible complaint is that the cap for the usb connector doesn't stay on as well as I'd like or have a place to store it while the device is in use. Short of that, I can't place a single complaint about the unit. It has been a well spent $20
POS	5.0	 This reciever is great! It even gets reception on 6 satelites inside my office building. I have played with many GPS units and have yet to see a reciever do that. This is a definte buy. It is extremely accurate also. I highly recomend it
POS	4.0	 The GPS works in both my Dell Axim X5 and in my HP Compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card. I have used it with MS Streets and Trips and ArcPad
NEG	1.0	 I won't recommend to any body. You have the same way of charging thru your computer. I think is waste
NEG	1.0	 Put the card in my W2000 PC, followed instructions. Got to the part about loading the driver, the book says to go to the \drivers\WIN2000 driver on the CD included in the box- guess what, it's not on the disk included in the box. Since I use a connection that needs this stupid card to work, now I have to find another PC and down load the driver
NEG	1.0	 Hard to figure out and organize music... battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often... don't recommend it. Very "Not happy
NEG	2.0	 A year later and I wish I had the money for an ipod. I have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and don't even take my player with me anywhere anymore. What's the point of having an mp3 player you can't walk around with? Ridiculous
NEG	1.0	 We bought three Creative players. My husband and I have the Zen micro and my daughter the Zen 20GB. All three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year. I didn't even use mine but maybe two hours per week. Good thing my daughter's was within her one year period by a couple of days. She still had to pay $25.00 Now my husband and I have to just junk ours and buy something else. Customer service is awful!! They won't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times. What a piece of garbage!!
NEG	1.0	 Don't waste your money. What iRiver doesn't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead, the system is useless. I will never buy one of their products again and I'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iRiver products. My system cost me $[...] and it is now as useless as the customer service department at iRive
NEG	2.0	 I have a 5gb but a lot of the H10's are having the same problem. I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....
NEG	2.0	 I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise. The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use. The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable. I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly. I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play. It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP. In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player). Finally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products! As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one. It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months. Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though). Be smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod
NEG	1.0	 Does not live up to expectations. Sound is tinny. Hard to find stations, very narrow band of reception...plan to purchase a grundig
NEG	2.0	 I ordered this mount for a Sharp 20 inch LCD and it's not that great. It was very easy to install, however, the arm when fully outstretched does not sit level. Thus when the TV is pulled away from the wall, the set is not level and very annoying to look at. I don't believe this is a fault in the actual part, but the design of the arm. This was relatively inexpensive for a wall mount - and you get what you pay for
NEG	1.0	 I'd recommend selecting a different security cable product, especially if you have a PowerBook or MacBook. This one is poorly made, even more poorly documented, and may have permanently damaged my PowerBook G4. (Yes, the product web site claims this model is compatible with the PB G4.) It's unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked. (Hey, would it be so bad to actually use *words* to explain things? Even in 4 or 5 languages if you like. The diagrams make no sense.) In the process of trying to get this to work, it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my PowerBook. It may have permanently damaged the slot. Needless to say, I will attempt to return the product for a refund. There are plenty of similar products on the market, including others avaiable through Amazon. I'd suggest trying one of those.
NEG	1.0	 Total garbage. No only this thing is huge, bigger than most mp3 players and it doesn't have a belt clip or anything, it sounds awful, absolutely horrible. The hiss others complained about is very loud, it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping, buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises. Besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible, low dynamics and distorts easily. This is a bad product that should be taken off the market. It's not even worth the price here. Heck, even $1.99 would be a waste of money. Avoid
NEG	2.0	 It is a great idea, with a few qualifiers. I have found that the forward and reverse buttons don't function for my video ipod or for my niece's nano (maybe it would for a non-apple mp3 player?). I have to pair the device to the Ipod every time I turn it on. The bluetooth transponder will drain the ipod's battery even though it has it's own battery. Sound quality is decent.
NEG	2.0	 It was great at first until the connector to iPod break by itself. The bluetooth signal wasn't the best, it loses signal constantly. I had to re-sync and paired it up several times over a month period. The high price iMuffs MB210 from WI-GEAR gives a better promise with the ability to stop your iPod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone. Its Bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on iPods with dock connectors, likely will not break as easily. I sure hope Logiteh will follow suit in this trend
NEG	2.0	 The sound crackles if the cord bends a bit at the connector. All around poor quality and construction. I'm thinking about returning it..
NEG	1.0	 It's Logitech...it should have a built in Microphone. instead there's a small head set. don't buy this. spend a little more for a built in microphone
NEG	1.0	 I have had this TV for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out, I called Samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty. They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours. 72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call. This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area. Fianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center. I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later. Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment. Why they didn't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don't know. I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order. Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again. Now I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can't see it, it doesn't matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future. What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months? If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth. I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point. I agree, you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc I am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my Samsung experience.
NEG	1.0	 This is the third Palm PDA I have owned. I bought the E2 directly from Palm after my previous palm died. It simply quit shortly after the warranty expired. Telephone support is poor and expensive. After research this is a common problem. My employer pays for PDA's for executives and since I approve of all of these products, I will hereafter not allow any purchase of any Palm product based on falty products, poor customer support and extremely poor customer support.
NEG	1.0	 I am somewhat computer savvy - I understand the the IP address assigned in installation needs to match what my own router assigned for an ip address. They don't match and I can't figure out how to change it. I called Netgear 4 days ago for help and they said their "senior tech" would have to call me back. Still waiting for that call. Back to Staples it goes. The installation appeared successful, but whenever I try to print, it says "error - printer is busy" The so-called instruction manual for this is laughable. IF you're not an advance level IT person, don't try it
NEG	2.0	 I bought this print server back in December 2005. I used it with my All-in-One Brother printer MFC-4800. The installation was easy. It worked great......for 4 months. Then...then... it just stoped working after 4 months. I tried to disconnect and reconnect the power, Ethernet cable etc...nothing helped. May be I just got a bad product
NEG	1.0	 I had the same problems as already stated. I am currently having the volume issue as well, and yes my batteries are weak (the light is on). The first unit I bought lasted two weaks and then there was no sound at all. I called Sharper Image and they agreed to send a replacement. I waited two weeks and nothing. I called again and they had no record of my previous phone call. They did send a replacement and told me it would be sent overnight if "deemed appropriate by management." It was not shipped overnight. Bottom line - this product is awful. Do not buy - I regret it! It is worth it to spend more money on a different product. This only has a 90 day warranty and it doesn't last quite that long.
NEG	1.0	 I waited 10 days for this to arrive. The first time I plugged it in it ran for 2 minutes. I typed Dear and the machine typed wcm" When I tried to erase wcm" the erase mechanism did not work. I turned the machine off and when I switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move, ie I cannot type or use the machine in any way. When the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and I had to stick them back on. Now when I look at the machine I can see it is assymetrical...there is a 1/4 gap in the base, so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere. This is not acceptable but I have no way to contact whoever Mstasad is. I have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but I don't have a typewriter that works. I feel cheated and am very upset..
NEG	2.0	 I got 0~1 bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help. But it didn't get any better. You'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you, I suppose.
NEG	1.0	 I bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging. It was not true to what was said. These batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera. And a set of Duracell Ultras, that are not rechargeable, lasted longer. Do not always believe what you read. Make sure you have the ability to return items. And is with this case, they went back. I went with a set of energizers. And they last much longer, with the power being the smae as these 1800mah monster brand
NEG	2.0	 I purchased the Zen Nano four months ago. It was working then total system failure. At first I thought the battery was dead, but a new battery didn't help. The screen would flash on and then off. It will not boot up. Plugging it into the computer did no good, it could not be reconized or accessed. It goes in the trash. In addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored. Also, the output volumn was to low. I would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise, it wasn't up to the task. Now it is landfill
NEG	2.0	 I had to buy a new one, and I chose another brand (Logitech) this time. There is no On/Off button, so the batteries run out if you don't take them out (I think the buttons are pressed during transportation). Now the battery contacts are not functioning properly. And I had the same problem described in a recent review: "I'll click three or four times and nothing happens. Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end. It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen."
NEG	1.0	 Do not buy. This may be the worst product I've ever bought. It has never worked properly. I've kept fresh batteries in it, but it's still no good. Within 10 feet of the laptop, I'll click three or four times and nothing happens. Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end. It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen. Awful product. Believe the bad reviews. It's worse than they describe. The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy. My cat loves the laser pointer
NEG	1.0	 DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE! This mouse has given me nothing but frustration. 1. The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low, causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time. 2. Battery life is horrible. Like 2 weeks... 3. When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes, it goes into an automatic sleep mode. The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to "revive" it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen. So I have to reboot my computer. Absolutely the worst!!
NEG	1.0	 I bought one of these. It worked OK about three months and then just quit. I do not recommend for anyone else
NEG	1.0	 I tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and I could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs, but most of the time it failed. I tried to record with an ipod - no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives. I'm very glad that amazon took this unit back. I would not recommend this unit. 
NEG	2.0	 Got it home and it had poor focus. The center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus. the next morning the focus problem was gone. Go figure. The big problem for me was the time it took to change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point. The Toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit Mute
NEG	1.0	 I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago. It has always been difficult to remove. (Note: despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.) Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it. After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out. That took over 30 minutes of struggle. My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw. Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks. I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation. If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus
NEG	1.0	 Mine didn't work out of the box. Just my experience. I am taking this thing back to the store tomorrow. I returned another crappy webcam today to buy this, so you can imagine how irritated I am with the lame quality of these things
NEG	2.0	 as far as using the ipod as a recorder I think an actual digital recorder would get better sound. The italk picks up all ambient sound. I have even used it with an external mic and still not wowed with the clarity
NEG	2.0	 It's partly my fault, of course. I bought this to use on my motorcycle. I thought the small size, especially the flat body, would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag. I also bought a special handlebar mount for it. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with it. It's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes. Whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle, it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route. Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only. The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive (at least, not for me), Worse still, it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes. The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time. Not very helpful. My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle. They should probably just stick to GPS.
NEG	1.0	 I use it for my Zen MicroPhoto and it does not work at all. It has the lowest battery life, used it for twenty mintues and it started to get worse and worse. There is no possible way of getting rid of the static unless you are the MP3 player below the transmitter, which is obviously dangerous while driving. You can only tune it to four stations which are 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7 which is absolutely pointless approach to an FM transmitter. I seriously regret every buying this transmitter
NEG	2.0	 It'll do in a pinch....but I hope there are better options. At times the sound is clear, however, most of the time the static is either 1) just annoying or 2) the static is so loud and piercing that you have to turn it off. I hope there are units that broadcast a stronger signal, or have another way to connect, in order to provide a constant tolerable sound quality. I would recommend spending some more money to get a reliable device. 
NEG	1.0	 I've spent over two hours tweaking this, and over an hour on the phone with customer support. The thing still wont connect to the internet. Don't get me wrong, the lights light up and my laptop can connect to the ROUTER, but the router wont connect to the internet. Belkin tech support told me to send it back. I will and I think I will try the Dlink Pre N. 
NEG	2.0	 Thinks my street is 50 feet before it actually is, therefore recalculates before the turn. If I go a different route, it continually tries to get me to make a "U" turn. Instead of shortest or fastest route, it may pick one that is very roundabout (you should see how it wants me to drive home from work). Maps need to be updated more often. Street Atlas or Streets and Maps do a better job of being updated...I'd use them except I don't want to tie up a PC just to drive across town. It might work well for cross country, for me, it's an expensive toy that I have yet to develop trust in. 
NEG	2.0	 This thing works well until a bulb blows out. When I replace the bulb, it will not turn off after 4 minutes and I end up having to replace it
NEG	1.0	 I knew I had to pay shipping for this cards ($5) so I decided to buy 4 at once, what was my surprise that at checkout they wanted to charge me five dollars shipping for each card eventhough they were going to be ship together I decided not to buy them anymore. They lie telling you that you are saving a huge 1% but at the end you pay almost 20 dollars for each card that is more or less 35% more than anywhere else. Its a shame that they try to rip you off that way. BUY THEM AT THE APPLE STORE ON LINE, NO SHIPPING FEE !!!!!!!! YOU PAY ONLY FACE VALUE NOT A CENT MOR
NEG	1.0	 Why does a 15.00 gift card cost 24.00? I was going to get one but first someone explain this to me? Is the card itself made out of gold? Whaz up wit dat
NEG	2.0	 I loved my little Seagate 5.0GB drive, even after the first one crashed and burned. But the second time, I cannot forgive. I carried it everywhere in my pocket, and maybe that was part of the problem, but if it can't handle that then it is no good to me. Solid state memory, here I come
NEG	1.0	 I dislike ipods so i figure I try something else and hope for the best..Unfortunately I was wrong Itunes and Ipods are definitely much better.. Basically this device is a cheap piece of crap and it seems like Sandisk's approach is WYSIWYG..disappointing PROS: - long battery life - email tech support is quick and good but website support sucks bad CONS: - it's easy to setup but instruction manual is useless - buttons are rigid and miniature and difficult to press with a skin on - wheel is very stiff and offers very little functionality - software is buggy and terrible - freezes occasionally - navigating through menus stutters and lags - boot time is 10 seconds - video mode has no options - needs serious firmware updates - time is listed only in settings menu = useless - tons of issues with playlists getting erased or not working properly - every firmware update erases all your settings, including radio presets and the list of issues goes on and on... anyone who has reviewed this product positively obviously didnt do a thorough job because these issues exist and its definitely irritating I am extremely disappointed and will never buy a sandisk player ever again My suggestion is to try it out thorougly before buying..so you dont make the same mistake I did and trust other people's lopsided reviews..
NEG	2.0	 The mouse worked well with my chipset, but beaware that earlier bluetooth chipsets do not have the power to work with this mouse, although the dongle that is bundled with this is excellent. The mouse was very difficult to use and unresponsive at times, requiring multiple clicks to choose items. It was sluggish across the screen and very insensitive, even after maxing out all the mouse settings in either direction. Looking through the forums at Anycom informed me that many people had a similar problem and RMA's were being issued. Considering that these problems arose earlier last year, I was upset that I was sold a defective product. I just send my mouse back to Newport, California for a replacement. The features are solid, the size is acceptable but prone to cramping at first. For a travel mouse it is exceptional, being rechargeable via USB. Usuage with the USB cable attatched is OK but somewhat awkward as the cable comes from the "head" of the mouse, not the "tail." Would I buy again? only if I didn't find another product that was rechargeable, bluetooth and optical.
NEG	1.0	 I bought this phone for a work-at-home situation. I then discovered that the maximum number of characters I could enter into a speed dial entry (the number itself, not the name) is 24 characters. A telephone calling card number is 25 characters long, 26 if you program a pause (a space, for this phone) between the phone number and the card id/pin. When I called Polycom about it, I was told that not everyone uses calling cards. Funny. I've been issued a calling card at every company for which I've worked (going back 25 years). This is the only phone I've ever owned (well, since the 80's) into which I could not program my calling cards. Pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss. On top of that, when I try and enter the calling card number and card id by hand, it never "takes" on the first try: the network doesn't recognize the card id and pin the first time I enter them. I have to do it twice (I've tried this a number of times, and it's consistent). For that matter, the sound quality, especially through the headset (also purchased from polycom) is not that good. Of course, that could be because the headset jack is "loose." You can easily move the jack from side to side, which makes the sound quality even worse. I regret having made this purchase. I'm going to scrap it and look for a new one from a different manufacturer. The only reason I gave it one star is because the site interface here won't let me give it no stars
NEG	1.0	 This thing sucks. I wasted my money. No more Griffin products for me
NEG	1.0	 The transmitter doesn't work. I tried everything I could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt
NEG	1.0	 This item said that it is compatible with all ipods but it is not. It is only compatible with the "old" ipods. Evidently there is a difference in some of the more recent ipods and this itrip doesn't work with them. We had to return the product
NEG	1.0	 I just got these at a local store and they just really blow!!! I was swayed by the brand name and the great price (although higher than Amazon). It's true when they say you get what you pay for... rock-bottom price = rock-bottom performance. Terrible to say the least. Mine are going back right now.
NEG	2.0	 Mine worked great for the first few months, then I started getting the "warning, check battery". If you take the batteries out and reinsert, it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up. It happened on both headsets. I called customer service and they told me this is the first time they've ever heard that (uh huh - doesn't sound like it from the reviews here). A little too expensive to replace yearly..
NEG	2.0	 I've had this mouse for about a month...use it with my Mac G4 at home...and I'm exhausted. It feels very nice in the hand and I really like the scrolling ball feature (hence the 2 stars), but it's just not predictable. Sometimes it glides along smoothly, most other times it tracks across the monitor like you're mousing over pebbles. I've tried a number of different surfaces: desktop (light woodgrain); smooth, medium gray fabric mouse pad; mouse pad made specifically for optical mice (better than the other two) and I have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission--to no avail. It still lags and I have a hard time honing in on an object to select it (or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle...) I use Photoshop and other mousing intensive apps all day at work and at home and I need a mouse that is precise (for silhouetting, etc.). This just isn't it. You shouldn't have to think about mousing when you're doing it, it should just happen--immediately and smoothly, corded or cordless. And a "newer" technology should work better that a gummed up "old" tracking ball mouse! Maybe it doesn't like my older Mac. Maybe it's the bluetooth adapter. Whatever it is, it's not working... I'll be trying the Logitech MX1000 next. It has a recharging base and is Laser (instead of optical). I'm hoping the higher price will translate into better performance
NEG	1.0	 For my PowerBook - my first bluetooth mouse (a macally bt) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk. So for the replacement I read the reviews and went with the Kensington bluetooth mini - primarily for the on/off functionality. I like the size and shape, the on/off switch and the scroll works just keen. However, tracking is a nightmare - especially when CPU usage is high (applications like Photoshop, Acrobat or using a VPN to access my work files). I tried troubleshooting, adjusting the track rate, but nope. The cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse. I think I'm going to throw in the towel and go back to wired
NEG	2.0	 One of the reasons I chose this mouse, was because Apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling. It turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others. It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add. Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don't. Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I'd buy something else
NEG	1.0	 I bought this in April for my new Canon 30D and it worked great until several months ago. When I would go back to scroll through the recently taken pictures on my camera it would start saying "Data Corrupted". It started out slowly then it would lose every third picture. I tried to reformat the card and got an error message. Now my camera does not recognize it nor does the camera software on my computer. It was a wonderful card while it lasted but I too am hesitate to get another one. Hopefully mine was a lemon too.....but then again
NEG	1.0	 This seemed like a great card at a great price. Unfortunately after 4 months, during the middle of a paid shoot, all of the images instantly dissappeared. I stopped using the card, put it aside until I got home. I tried to use software to recover the images. Only a few could be recovered, the rest were gone. I've not been able to re-format the card in either a canon eos 5d, digital rebel, or using software on my computer. The card is now completely un-usable. All of my older cards continue to work just fine. Hopefully this is just a lemon, although I need to replace it, and am obviously apprehensive about purchasing another one from Sandisk
NEG	1.0	 I purchased 3 of these APs with the expectation to replace 3 Cisco "b" APs and drop in. The setup used Radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs. After config (the web UI constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re-login) the system would work. One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn't accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now. I would HIGHLY recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it's buggy and has poor support. Config is difficult (I had to learn how to use the command line config), the upgrades are not well documented (they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp - you don't but...), however the unit does have good range and works (No RADIUS of course) in a basic config.
NEG	2.0	 First - a disclaimer: I know very little about telephone headsets, but decided to buy one because I had a series of long telephone meetings coming up. I walked to my local Staples store, expecting to find a variety of prices and products - and thinking that I'd pay perhaps $30 to $50 at the low end of the market. At the store, I found that only the computer-based headsets were that cheap - and the only model that worked on a real, old-fashioned land line was the Plantronics S11 on display (it was priced at $130 Canadian). Since work was paying for it, I didn't mind spending the extra money, but expected that, at that price, the quality and ease of use would be quite high. When I brough it back to the office and installed it, I found that: - The regular handset and the headset cannot be plugged in at the same time. That means that every time I want to use the headset, I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires. - The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low - even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset. - The microphone, although it's somewhat adjustable, is short and inflexible enough that I can't get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer, the earpiece turns and slips off my ear. - The headset itself - that is, the plastic, adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker - is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular two-sided earphone unit - so that it would be more balanced and stay secure. I don't know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general. Overall, however, if I'd been buying the S11 with my own money, I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset
NEG	1.0	 Since I first wrote this review I discovered that the fault was not with the scanner but with my computer. After formatting my computer I was able to install the scanner and software without any problems. I am still learning to use it but so far I have decided not to return it. It works well and I like it very much. I apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone's choice
NEG	2.0	 I have approximately 10,000 slides to scan. I purchased the 4850 and after about 3,000 slides began to get three to four dark blue lines across the image. After reporting it to HP they sent me a replacement TMA. The new TMA worked fine for the first 450 slides and then BINGO, I now am getting two dark blue lines again. I think the machine is not engineered to handle the work load I have.
NEG	1.0	 My daughter really didn't use it that much but within about 5 weeks it started to fall apart. The wood veneer on the base pulled up and splintered from tightening the strings to tune it. A low price for a guitar but I don't think it's even worth this price.
NEG	1.0	 These phones had so much static, you could not hear!!! We ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use!
NEG	1.0	 I bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2-line phone with answering capability. Turns out, I cannot keep it, due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me. The good: it's nice looking, compact, has good sound, and has a selection of cute little ringtones. The bad: This machine WILL NOT RECORD INCOMING MESSAGES SILENTLY. It broadcasts both the OGM and the ICM being left by the caller through the speaker. There is no way I know of to defeat this. You can turn the volume down from loud to medium loud, but you cannot set the machine to record messages silently, in the background. Do you think you might ever not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your recorder? Would you ever want to sleep without being disturbed by the sound of incoming messages? Then this one isn't for you. Mine is for sale.
NEG	1.0	 My very first cell phone was Motorola, and it served me great, so I became attached to the brand based on that experience ,and for that reason alone bought Motorola SD4591 Digital Corded/Cordless System. As we've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks. The battery life got very short very soon too. I was told I need to get different batteries NiH instead of NiCD. Naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too. As we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5.8Hz 2 line phone I decided to get Motorola MD7091 5.8GHz Digital 2-line Phone and remained loyal to Motorola. And boy was I wrong again. What others are saying about caller ID not showing as soon as I have another phone on the same line besides Motorola MD 7091 is true in my case too. I don't get it does Motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones??? This is really cheap trick Naturally, I could blame all this on poor quality of NiCD batteries, Wireless Network, Microwaves and phone company, and other brands' phones connected to my line. But what is the common thread through the entire ordeal: MOTOROLA. I will give other brands a try now, not yet sure which ones
NEG	1.0	 Now, imagine my astonishment. After receiving this beautifully designed futuristic looking set from my favorite communication device manufacturers, I set it up only to realize that the cordless phone only works when there is a direct line of site to the base! Unbelievable!! I live in a compact apartment ok, and believe me when I say it isn't 20 feet between the base and my bed room, and last night after setting up, I retreated to my room took up the cordless handset to make a call only to realize that there was no connection to the base. This phone in a nutshell, looks good, but it sucks!!
NEG	2.0	 I had high hopes for this case when I bought it, but it just hasn't worked out. The leather has a nice feel, and my iPAQ fit snugly in it's slot. However the stylus on my iPAQ h2215 was impossible to get to without partially removing the iPAQ from it's case. This became so frustrating that I eventually discontinued using this case. It does have three slots for credit cards, and a larger slot that you could tuck a few folded dollar bills or business cards in. Maybe a different model of iPAQ would work better, but it hasn't been a good fit for me
NEG	1.0	 I agree with the previous review. This phone cord worked twice. Now, it only retracts about half way, and keeps getting worse. I'm returning it for a refund. Don't waste your time with this
NEG	1.0	 I am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke..
NEG	1.0	 ipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no? if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to mpeg4. Also the video you convert may have a few complications, the audio and video may not be sychronized...at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to download.com and search for jodix video converter. This is not from speculations I have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted. Suggestion check out the creative zen vision M sure it may be thicker but the price is amazing for its features and conveniences of transfering files into it
NEG	1.0	 I bought with lots of ilussion this this Ipod, i put all my music in it and use it!! after a 5 months it stop working, it didn't charge the battery. I took it to best buy where I bought it and they told me that it has "external damage" and didn' repair it. I send it to Apple service and return it without services because the same reason. My Ipod didn't have that damage, it has only a few scratches on the screen. After lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it I would have to pay US$250.00 that is almost what it cost new. TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM APPLE.. SHORT LIVE.. DON'T RECOMMENDED. Now I'm looking for another option for MP3 player to buy. If you know one please let me know it. 
NEG	2.0	 Like other fm transmitters I have tried, this one leaves much to be desired. Living in a major urban area, I was unable to find any fm channel that did not produce significant static and generally poor sound quality. Product is easy to use, but I consider the sound quality unacceptable.
NEG	1.0	 The phone worked for a month or two, and then the handset stopped seeing the base. When I followed the instructions in the manual to fix this (re-register the handset to the base), neither could see each other. The base still gets the land-line signal and works with speakerphone, but that is useless to me since I need the handset. When I contacted Uniden through their email support, I got no response. I will be buying another phone that is not a Uniden
NEG	1.0	 I'm pissed. I feel I've been ripped off. The 3rd party vendor delivered a defective unit. I want to return it. I have been unable to determine how to return this unit for a refund. I may never buy through Amazon again
NEG	1.0	 This product did not reliabley work in a new Sony PSP running the current Sony software. Don't know if the design is flawed or the unit I received was defective
NEG	1.0	 Got it and plugged it into my IPod and there was a major incompatibility. The screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the IPod but when I went to record I received an error message that the IPod could not locate a microphone. Perhaps an IPod problem? The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated. I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis. Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod????
NEG	2.0	 I just received my pair today, and I have to say, I'm extremely dissapointed. Yes, they are comfortable, but the bass is almost absent, no matter how far you jam them into your ears, the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be, it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid & hi's they produce. Unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max, I'd recommend another pair of earphones. If you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass, these are your headphones. But, as others said, you can find much better earphones for a much lower price
NEG	2.0	 The first thing I did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually WAS an Apple product. Its REALLY cheap looking. Looks like something you'd find for [...] at a flea market or in the "stocking stuffers" section of the dollar store at Christmas time. The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit. This looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit. Certainly not a [...] accessory. It just cheapens the Apple image. If OEM Apple products are your thing, then go ahead and try this. But if you're looking for something as sweet as your nano that stays put while you workout, look for something else. I'm returning mine this weekend to spend my money elsewhere.
NEG	1.0	 3 more of the useless flimsy holders you get in the IPod box!
NEG	1.0	 I had a very poor experience with the Microsoft Media Center infrared keyboard and I wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would - I thought - get rid of all connection problems. I was wrong. The hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections. AS usual, I was very careful: I always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product - I don't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason: the package doesn't come cheap... I am a software developer - I have half a dozen computers at home - and I did everything as instructed. I found the software to be very average in terms of usability (why do they try to do all these fancy effects??), but that's not very important when it works fine. Unfortunately, after just a couple of days, the keyboard stopped working. I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer (both step were required - the on/off switch didn't work - same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective). Now, the mouse keeps on dropping connections. After a couple of hours of inactivity, the mouse simply stops responding. This is simply unacceptable. Logitech knows that this product doesn't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it wasn't tested properly. It is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great. Don't buy this product, you could be very disappointed. Note that I have seen another installation done by professional Windows system administrators that had the exact same problems. Now don't get me wrong: the hardware is very nice. I would highly recommend the Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks which is great and had none of the issues I have mentioned there
NEG	2.0	 This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse. When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use
NEG	1.0	 The unit works fine as a Bluetooth Radio. The software and drivers!!!! do not install properly at all!!! I am a network administrator & pretty savvy about PCs - i could not come up with any scenario to get the software to work!!! Save your money and just buy the unit - forget the software
NEG	1.0	 DOES NOT WORK AT ALL DONT THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY SHOULD READ 0 STAR
NEG	1.0	 I had Vonage since April, 2006. I finally switched back to Qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone (my cell phone, as my Vonage line didn't work) with tech support. Here is my experience: 1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone # over to Vonage. Don't be too excited about getting the first month free- if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over. 2) After my number was finally switched over, outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 20-30 seconds. Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute. This resulted in having to call the person back, saying "sorry the call was dropped- we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems...." This is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download, 600kbps upload) and a wireless 'g' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems. I spent no less than 4 - 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem. After talking with tech support, sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily- while I was on the phone with them- but return shortly thereafter. 3) As a result of the problems I had, I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working. Be warned, they are very hard-nosed about providing any credits for poor or no service. I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service, and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given. After the problem had been fixed (temporarily), I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month, not previous months of no or poor service. THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE. 4) Finally, in September, still with dropped calls from Vonage, I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service. I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage. And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back. In the end, I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works. I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees, etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not, which is unfortunate. In any case, I guess you get what you pay for. One last thing: Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan, they never will. This means eventually they will either go out of business, or have to raise rates. Save yourself the problems I had- pay the extra $ to get phone service that works
NEG	1.0	 I bought vonage service thinking that finally there is a company which will let me control everything from their web portal, and provide features that traditional phone companies do not. Good thing I kept my number with traditional phone company and got a second line with Vonage. Its voice quality was really bad, and cancelling it was a pain to say the least. It took me 4 months to cancell it. Waiting forever on hold. Please read internet forums/blogs before you decide to "save" money
NEG	1.0	 Stay away from Vonage! After more than 1 month, still don't have phone number transferred. Can't get thru to customer service...very long wait. Paying 2 phone bills...so much for saving cost and so-called service. Called to cancel service, and customer service rep promised to put account/billing on hold until phone number transfer is done...finally something positive from customer service department
NEG	1.0	 Very disappointing speakers! Rip off. I returned them. 1. Satellites produce static noise even with the computer turned off. You have to press the mute button to get rid of it. 2. Extremely rumble base; not crisp. Even turned all the way down it is too prominent. Maybe good for war games. 3. Missing mid tone. Satellites sound like they are coming out off a tin can. 4. Volume is a bit underpowered. Will not knock your socks off
NEG	1.0	 I too bought one and had the headphone jack become loose. I bought another thinking I had a faulty one, but now I'm having the same issue with this one. The loose jack causes the reception to go in and out...and finally just out completely. I agreed with the previous opinions on this fatal flaw
NEG	2.0	 1. There was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when I tried multiple jacks for the base. 2. Phone features worked as advertised. but the Voice Enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse. 3. It was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset. I returned it mainly because of the buzzing
NEG	1.0	 I bought this and found that if you like to burn your own CD's to play in it, it has a problem reading the tracks. It sometimes spins up and doesn't play, and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find. I usually wake to that sound before the music starts. I AM NOT A LIGHT SLEEPER. This is my second one, and I've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months. Do yourself a favor and find a different product
NEG	1.0	 This product DOES NOT have the skip feature included in the product descriptio
NEG	1.0	 YOUR BUYING 128 MB WORTH OF FRUSTRATION AND $10 WORTH OF GAS FROM BACK AND FORTH TO WAL-MART. I bought my Creative MuVo and had it for a month or so. LOVED IT. had everything i needed, great mp3 worked great. One day, plugged it in to put a song on it and all of the sudden it starts smoking. Big hole in it from all the smoke. So, i return it at walmart for a new one. TWO DAYS LATER i plug it in my usb to put a song on it - smokes again!!!!!!! i returned it and got my money back... got an ipod shuffle, buy that much better mp3 player wont start on fire...
NEG	1.0	 The keyboard and mouse work fine, except for some completely absurd reason, Logitech decided to remove the INSERT and ESCAPE keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead. Look at the picture and you will see what I mean -- the DELETE key is double-size and takes up the space where the insert key would be; INSERT is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button. ESCAPE is in the usual place, but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key. Very annoying. Definately returning it
NEG	1.0	 Ordered it, took about 5 days to get to me, and it's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it
NEG	2.0	 I was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes. The scroll wheel is really "push happy" such that when I roll the wheel, the middle button registers a "click" very often. In order to prevent the inadvertant click, I have to roll the wheel with the lightest of light touches. It's significantly more senstive than my older logitech wheel, and was really really annoying to have the browser repeatedly register the middle button (which is unix is the default "paste" so I'd have pages and pages of text that I "selected" be pasted on to the browser or editor while what I really wanted was just to scroll the buffer!!! Too bad, the mouse was really high quality overall.
NEG	1.0	 The JBL Speakers worked fine for 3 weeks and all of a sudden, they quit. In the future, I will buy this type of merchandise locally so that I have some recourse
NEG	1.0	 I was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews, however, I have been extremely disappointed in them. I may have had too high of expectations, but these things put out NO bass whatsoever (it just sounds muffled and cruddy), and the overall sound is extremely poor. I'm really surprised as I've owned JBL speakers in my car that I was extremely pleased with, so I'm amazed at the lacking quality in these. I would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included
NEG	2.0	 These speakers sound great - but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that's a no-no. So you reach for your phones and... no place to plug them in! How lame is that? Also whoever designed the Volume/On/Off knob is an idiot. The thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it, the whole speaker just slips away from you. They're so light that they don't have enough resistance to stay put. So you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other (unless you velcro them to your desk or something). Too bad because - like I said - they sound great
NEG	1.0	 Agree with the prior reviewers. I can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses!
NEG	2.0	 I have bought several of these. Some came in a fancy blister, and others in a coushing bag. Stay away from those. Be sure you're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different. I give the generic two stars just because it works. I give four stars to the original because as others reviewers have said it's a little difficult to remove the card
NEG	2.0	 I bought this for easy transfer of pictures from my digital camera with SD memory card anywhere not home and sometimes from other peoples memory card (xD and memory stick).. First of all I was disappointed with the flimsy, plastic design and the size of it. But it would have been ok if it worked!..IT DOESNT READ my SD card. And as menetioned in other people's review hard to insert and take out the cards! I'm scared if the cards get scratch and ruined whenever i do it. I wish I have bought this after reading amazon reviews...it's useless now. I'm lost how I can get sd card work on this and if I do, scared of frequent use for the flimsy design
